<p class="quoteb">&#8220;What threatens mankind Is a lethal and unpredictably
volatile mixture of global warming with associated floods, ozone
layer depletion with attendant cancers and disruption of ocean food
chains ... the acidification of forests, lakes and crops, all
combining to precipitate recurring cycles of famine and drought.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This was the devastating scenario of the breakdown of our
ecological system by atmospheric pollution produced by the US
National Academy of Science in 1987. The calamitous flooding of
Bangladesh and the severe weather fluctuations which have devastated
major food-growing areas of the world during the past year have
catapulted the issue of global pollution into much greater
prominence. Deforestation and soil erosion, serious stratospheric
depletion of the earth&#8217;s protective ozone layer, together with
colossal increases in gaseous emissions &#8211; principally carbon
dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) &#8211; have underlined the fears
of working people.</p>

<p>Such is the general concern on this issue that even Thatcher has
been forced to make sympathetic noises. In the greatest metamorphosis
since St Paul fell off his horse on the way to Damascus, she has
suddenly discovered that the Tories have been &#8216;green&#8217; all along.
Phrases about &#8216;acid rain&#8217; and concern for the &#8216;Greenhouse
Effect&#8217; tripped from her lips.</p>

<p>This is sheer hypocrisy. Britain is the only major European
country to so far refuse to make a 30 per cent reduction in sulphur
emissions that cause acid rain. At the same time Ridley, the misnamed
Environment Secretary, delayed an international treaty to control
ozone-destructive chemicals. Perhaps this new-found concern is not
unconnected with the fact that 74 &#8216;green&#8217; motions were originally
tabled even for the tame Tory Party Conference.</p>

<p>Scientists have long argued that dramatic changes in the earth&#8217;s
atmosphere through gaseous pollution, mainly carbon dioxide, would
have a disastrous effect on the ecological system, the so-called
&#8216;Greenhouse Effect&#8217;. It is now generally accepted that if present
trends in the production of carbon dioxide and deforestation
continue, the resulting global temperature rise will produce enormous
weather variations which will disrupt agriculture and submerge some
presently low-lying land area as the polar ice cap melts.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Aral Sea</h4>

<p class="fst">The planet only supports life because of the delicate and
harmonious relationship between the sun&#8217;s rays, oxygen and carbon
dioxide. The small quantity of carbon dioxide is essential directly
or indirectly for all forms of life. Plants absorb carbon dioxide and
convert it into essential foodstuffs and oxygen. These in turn are
consumed by humans and other animals who release more carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere &#8211; completing the cycle. But today this fine
balance is being disturbed and on a massive scale. The anarchic
development of capitalism and the rapacious greed of today&#8217;s
multi-national corporations now threaten humanity with extinction.</p>

<p>The Stalinist bureaucracy have also displayed a hooligan attitude
to the environment. Lake Baikal, the world&#8217;s largest freshwater
lake, is grossly polluted, so also is the inland Aral Sea. This sea
is located in Uzbekistan. The Uzbeki elite used the waters of the
Aral Sea to irrigate the deserts of the area, which is now the major
cotton-producing region of the USSR. But in so doing they have
polluted the Aral Sea and the water table in the surrounding area.
Irrigation canals were built without concrete linings and therefore
the water seeped into the ground. The excess minerals in the land
combined with the naturally saline ground, making the land so salty
it can no longer produce crops unless it is flushed out with even
more water. The high salinity is now affecting the underground
artesian wells. With most of the marine life in the Aral Sea killed,
this area, which was once rich in fish, now has to import fish from
Murmansk for the canning factories situated on the shores of this now
barren sea.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that the issue that triggered the
upheavals in Armenia was pollution. It was a demonstration of workers
from Aboyan protesting against the building of a rubber factory which
merged with nationalist demonstrations in Yerevan. The whole of the
Transcaucasus is recognised as a heavily polluted area, as also is
much of Eastern Europe. One third of Poland has been described by the
Polish government as &#8216;ecologically damaged.&#8217; The Chernobyl
disaster in the Ukraine spread throughout Europe, but was especially
dangerous in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia.</p>

<p>For centuries, man has used coal as the principal source of fuel &#8211;
for cooking and heating. But the burning of coal produces many air
borne pollutants including smoke, dust and sulphur dioxide which are
injurious to health and the growth of plants and animals. In England
as early as 1273 attempts were made to prohibit the use of coal in
London. In 1306 a committee of inquiry was appointed to &#8220;Inquire of
all such who burnt sea-coal in the city or parts adjoining, and to
punish them for the first offence with great fines and ransoms, and
upon the second offence to demolish their furnaces.&#8221; By the
seventeenth century coal burning was so out of control that John
Evelyn submitted a report to Charles II claiming that &#8220;London&#8217;s
inhabitants breathe nothing but an impure and thick mist accompanied
with a fuliginous and filthy vapour ... corrupting the lungs.&#8221; The
rapid industrialisation of England&#8217;s major cities during the
industrial revolution was entirely due to the use of coal as a
primary energy source. Combustion of coal was on such a scale that a
permanent pall of smoke hung over many towns obscuring the sunlight
and causing rickets in children. Sunlight contains ultra-violet rays
which can synthesize the essential vitamin D in the skin.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Ozone</h4>

<p class="fst">The large scale combustion of fossil fuels &#8211; oil, coal and gas &#8211;
for energy in modem times, together with the destruction of much of
the world&#8217;s rainforests, has enormously disturbed the carbon
dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Air monitoring In Hawaii and
the Antarctica since the early 1950s has shown an exponential
increase in carbon dioxide concentration. From an estimated 270 parts
per million (ppm) in the 1850s it has risen to an alarming 335 ppm
today. Unless halted, it is predicted that the concentration could
increase to as much as 600 ppm by the year 2030. Combustion processes
alone release over 6.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide annually whilst
jungle clearances add a further 1.5 billion tons.</p>

<p>The released carbon dioxide creates a dense blanket around the
earth permitting the sun&#8217;s rays to enter but trapping the heat that
otherwise would be radiated into outer space. This &#8216;Greenhouse
Effect&#8217; has already raised global temperatures by over 0.5 degrees
centigrade over the past 100 years.</p>

<p>This condition is made worse by a cocktail of chemicals dumped
into the atmosphere &#8211; the most notorious being the
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used as a propellant in aerosols. Around 1
million tons of CFCs escape into the air each year. Every molecule of
CFC released is 10,000 times more effective in trapping the sun&#8217;s
heat than carbon dioxide &#8211; producing a doubling heat effect. There
is also now irrefutable evidence linking CFCs with the vast holes in
the ozone layer in the stratosphere.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Agriculture</h4>

<p class="fst">The ozone layer acts as a giant filter of the extremely harmful
ultra-violet radiation from the sun. A one per cent depletion,
according to the US National Academy of Science, will cause a two per
cent increase in cancer.</p>

<p>CFCs and carbon dioxide could push up the planet&#8217;s temperature
by as much as 4.5 degrees by 2030 and a staggering 8.6 degrees over
the next century. Using the most conservative results, they conclude
that sea levels would rise by as much as 4&#8211;5 feet. Yet a rise of
just 18 inches would submerge Asia&#8217;s rice growing areas.</p>

<p>The &#8216;Greenhouse Effect&#8217; will make the climate hotter, wetter
and cloudier. The climatic changes would have a disastrous effect on
agriculture. For example, high carbon dioxide levels could stimulate
plant growth. But this potential benefit would be offset by the
higher temperature which would stimulate plant growth which in turn
would facilitate greater energy consumption. Moreover the thicker
cloud cover could inhibit photosynthesis &#8211; the process by which
plants manufacture their food.</p>

<p>But a more serious consequence of global warming could see a
gradual shift of important agricultural regions to much higher
latitudes. The great corn and soya bean belts at middle latitudes in
the USA, for example, would move northwards to areas where the soil
would be unsuitable for intensive farming. The same story would be
repeated for central Europe. A much changed rainfall pattern would
also exist and move north to northern Canada, Siberia and
Scandinavia. These areas with their poorer soils will be unable to
replace the present world&#8217;s granaries. The USA and Canada supply 80
per cent of the world&#8217;s trade in wheat. Diminishing reserves of
food would create mass starvation and famines that would dwarf those
presently occurring in the Sudan and Ethiopia.</p>

<p>There is mounting evidence that this frightening picture of the
irreversible breakdown of our world is now occurring and at an
alarming rate. Among many tell-tale signs has been the discovery that
the arctic permafrost has warmed up by as much as three degrees over
the past 100 years. Alaskan glaciers have been melting and drifting
has increased. Retreating snowlines on mountains the world over, the
observed movement northwards of the agricultural cropline in the
Canadian Prairies, the changed distribution of plants and animals:
all have added credibility to the argument that the ecological system
is breaking down.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Deserts</h4>

<p class="fst">Marxists have never opposed the tremendous achievements that
science has contributed to society. But under capitalism it has been
used and developed in an irrational and unplanned manner which has
resulted in many catastrophes. On a global scale capitalism has
proved incapable of using the capacity of modern science and
technology to ease the nightmare conditions of the 4.4 billion people
of the &#8216;Third World&#8217;, described in a recent <strong>World Bank Report</strong>
as &#8220;conditions of life so characterised by malnutrition,
illiteracy, disease, squalid surroundings, high infant mortality and
low life expectancy as to be beneath any reasonable definition of
human decency.&#8221; While advances In science and technology have made
possible the development of the microchip, computers and robots, the
real &#8216;energy crisis&#8217; for over 2 billion people is to obtain the
firewood and dung they still depend on as fuel for cooking. For them,
firewood can only be obtained by systematically destroying forests
which, in the ex-colonial world, have been disappearing at an
horrendous rate of one million hectares a month.</p>

<p>Denuded of any vegetation, the top soil quickly becomes washed
away creating deserts and reducing rainfall. In India, the 250,000
sq. mile Rajputana desert was once heavily populated. In Roman times
the granary of the Empire was in North Africa. Now, without
irrigation and water management, this area is afflicted by droughts,
floods, soil erosion and creeping deserts. Today the Sahara consumes
30,000 hectares each year. Throughout the ex-colonial world
capitalist monopolies distort whole economies to produce a single
commodity, cash crops or minerals, with no concern for the
environment or the delicate interrelationships of nature. Thus in
north east Brazil, whereas in 1900 an area known as the Hump was 40
to 50 per cent forest, today it is less than five per cent.</p>

<p>A searing indictment of the short sighted and disastrous policies
of big business has been in relation to the Amazonian rain forests.
The devastation of the mighty forests and its ecological system has
been on such a magnitude and ferocity as that of an atomic explosion.
The greatest ecological disaster in history is now making a decisive
intervention on our weather.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Amazon</h4>

<p class="fst">The rain-forests, covering an area larger than the whole of
Western Europe, have been described as the lungs of the world. The
trees, accounting for over a third of the world&#8217;s total, produce
through photosynthesis over a half of the world&#8217;s annual production
of oxygen and in turn contribute to the balance of carbon dioxide.
Undisturbed, the forests exist as a result of a delicate and complex
interchange with the limited amounts of nutrients in the biomass
which is recycled within the system. Living almost independently of
the soil, as much as 50 per cent of rainfall is recycled, also
maintaining a constancy of temperature.</p>

<p>Such is the abundance and diversity of plant and animal life that
scientists have as yet been unable to make a comprehensive
classification. There are at least 17,000 insects, 500 to 600 species
of flora and over 2,000 species of birds alone. The brutal
transformation of the rainforests which has now reached inconceivable
proportions, not only threatens the extinction of the ecosystem but
has also done irreversible damage to the environment. This has, in
turn, reverberated upon the competing monopolies and has had serious
repercussions for local farmers.</p>

<p>With the blessing of the Brazilian government the competing
multinational companies launched a ferocious assault on the jungle to
transform it into a vast pasture land for cattle for the world
market. In just over two decades over a quarter of the forests of the
Amazon basin and Mato Grosso were destroyed. In the last decade alone
over 11 million hectares were cleared &#8211; corresponding to hundreds
of millions of trees. Seeking spectacular profits for minimum
investments and no controls, the companies ignited the great forests
with napalm bombs and defoliants. The vast jungle fires, consuming
hundreds of millions of trees, lasting many months, were first
observed by a Landsat satellite in 1975.</p>

<p>The fires and smoke in turn killed off the insects and rodents
whose presence was essential for the cultivation of many plants,
especially the nut tree. Thus In the province of Acre, the entire
population of nut trees were lost &#8211; resulting in over 10,000 nut
gatherers losing their livelihood. Moreover, once the residual
nutrients were washed away from the exposed soil, it became hard,
brittle and infertile. The cleared jungle was planted with quick
growing guinea grass whose fertility levels were such that after five
years their growth declined. The lasting effects of the defoliant
also killed off the vitally important broad leaf legumes, which
enrich the soil by capturing nitrogen from the air and not from the
soil. Problems of bush invasion, fungus and soil leaching
intensified. The loss of vegetation immediately disrupted the
ecosystem. Rainfall declined by almost five per cent and the
temperature soared to over 30 degrees.</p>

<p>Under a socialist plan for energy all types of energy production
would be considered on the basis of safety, efficiency and
environmental concern. An immediate programme to eliminate waste
through insulation and conservation would be implemented. This could
save energy and create thousands of jobs in the building industry. It
has been calculated that 75% of heating for homes is lost through
walls, roofs and floors and that 60% of total energy in power
stations is lost as heat &#8211; through cooling water &#8211; into the
environment. With recent advances in technology, combined heat and
power stations can supply hot water to entire communities. These
stations are already in use in Denmark, where they supply over half
the country&#8217;s heating requirements.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Energy</h4>

<p class="fst">Such a programme could be linked to re-equipping existing power
stations to make them more efficient. Coal fired stations, presently
only operating at 30% efficiency, could be made far more efficient
with the introduction of the fluidised bed combustion process whereby
air is blown through a moving flow of burning coal. A Department of
Energy paper has estimated that such a programme would create half a
million jobs between now and the year 2000 and, at the same time,
conserve valuable coal and oil reserves.</p>

<p>Priority would also be given to the development of renewable
sources such as wind, solar and geothermal energy which do not
produce harmful pollution and irreversible damage to the environment.
Research in the USA, Japan and Australia has shown that such an
integrated energy programme could provide up to 6 times as many jobs
as the equivalent nuclear programme. The prestigious National Science
Foundation of America recommended as far back as 1972 that an
investment of $3.5 billion in solar energy would provide 35% of the
country&#8217;s heating and cooling needs, 40% of fuel and 20% of
electricity. A similar study in Britain in 1974, which has recently
been re-examined, showed that solar power, mainly for domestic and
industrial heating, could provide as much as 14% of energy needs here
with wave power providing over 30%. The recent advances in solar
power technologies, principally a new type of photo-voltaic cell, has
made possible the large scale production of cheap energy.</p>

<p>Future generations may benefit from a near infinite energy source
in nuclear fusion when that process is perfected and made safe.
Fusion uses as its fuel Deuterium (heavy water) which is present in
vast quantities in the oceans of the world &#8211; sufficient for
millions of years. In stark contrast to nuclear fission, fusion
would, as far as is presently known, be a safe form of energy without
pollution. But the limited amounts available for research has meant
that there are still technical problems to overcome.</p>

<p>The destruction of the environment has now reached calamitous
proportions. The &#8216;Greenhouse Effect&#8217;, wanton destruction of
rainforests and ozone depletion is inevitable in a society dominated
by blind market forces. The inherent contradictions, antagonisms and
the competition of interests makes capitalism absolutely incapable of
developing the immense natural potential energy sources that exist or
even introduce adequate safeguards against pollution and harmful effects.</p>
