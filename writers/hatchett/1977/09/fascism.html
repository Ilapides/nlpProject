<p class="fst">FASCIST movements today can be defeated. Fascism in the 1930&#8217;s could have been defeated. There is no inevitable historical force which marches forward independently of the working class. Most of both acacademic and popular histories of the rise of German fascism portray a sense of inevitability in the rise of Hitler, echoing the images of Leni Reifenstahl&#8217;s Nazi film <em>The Triumph of the Will</em>. For a contemporary polemic on both the strategies and tactics for defeating German fascism in the 1930s we must reread Trotsky. <strong>International Socialism</strong> republished some of Trotsky&#8217;s 1930-34 writings with the title <strong>Fascism, Stalinism, and the United Front</strong> in 1969; some copies are still available from Bookmarx at 30p. Also available are Trotsky, <strong>Fascism: What it is and how to fight it</strong> (Pathfinder 35p) and Trotsky, <strong>The Struggle Against Fascism in Germany</strong> (Penguin &#163;1.50).</p>

<p>In addition there are: Daniel Guerin, <strong>Fascism and Big Business</strong> (Pathfinder &#163;2.05), Vajda, <strong>Fascism as a Mass Movement</strong> (Alison and Busby &#163;2.95) and Ernst Nolte, <strong>Three Faces of Fascism</strong> (New English Library &#163;1.50). For a good interpretation of some of the problems raised in these, and other writings, dig out a copy of <strong>International Socialism 42</strong> in which Peter Sedgwick wrote <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/sedgwick/1970/02/fascism.htm" target="new"><em>The Problem of Fascism</em></a> as a review article on <strong>The Nature of Fascism</strong> ed. S.J. Woolf and <strong>Political Violence and Public Order</strong> by Robert Benewick. The latter title was revised and reissued as <strong>The Fascist Movement in Britain</strong> (Allen Lane &#163;1.60) and is the most readable account of the rise and fall of Mosley between the wars. Two articles by Colin Sparks, <em>Fascism in Britain</em> in <strong>IS&#160;71</strong> and <em>Fascism: The Lessons of Cable Street</em> in <strong>IS&#160;94</strong>, are indispensable. For a very good novel on the impact of fascism on the Italian peasantry read Ignazio Silone, <strong>Fontamara</strong> (Journeyman, 85p). Another perspective is provided by Reich, <strong>The Mass Psychology of Fascism</strong> (Penguin &#163;1.00).<br />
