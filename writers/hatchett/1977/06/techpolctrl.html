<p class="fst"><B>The Technology of Political Control</B><BR>Ackroyd, Margolis,
Rosenhead, &amp; Shalice<BR><I>Penguin &pound;1.25</I></P>
<p class="fst">THE problem of reviewing this book is posed by a theme which is
summarised on the cover.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;They (the authors) have written a a careful,
chilling and sane book on what is certainly the central political
question of our time.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">This book is certainly carefully researched and provides chilling
evidence of the new technology open to a state&rsquo;s control
agencies. But the issues raised do not constitute &lsquo;the central
political question of our time.&rsquo; Those people who do argue this
view, or more frequently a less extreme version of it, tend to be
paralysed by the politics of paranoia. The authors of this book are
not at the extreme pole of this view but the presentation of their
arguments nourish that interpretation. The more blood curdling
aspects of the international use of new forms of torture,
manipulation, intelligence operations etc., will come as a revelation
to the majority of Penguin book buyers browsing through W.H. Smugs.
The information in the book provides valuable ammunition for the
debate on the use of science and the nature of technological
innovation.</P>
<P>But the value of the information is distorted by the framework of
political ideas in which it is placed. The central dynamic of class
conflict is seen through a conspiratorial prism. The vision that
appears takes the form of an encroaching Corporate &lsquo;Strong
State&rsquo;. The message that filters through, seemingly derivative
of Marcuse, is &lsquo;They are many, we are few&rsquo;.</P>
<P>Now this is not to argue that the state is not becoming more
repressive; on the contrary. The needs of capital in Britain today
are such that the state is attempting to be more coercive. But such
measures over the last few years have only enjoyed a partial success.
Working class organisation has shown itself to be extremely
resilient. We need to go forward with courage, arguing for socialist
alternatives, and not lose sight of the fact that it is in the
workplace that we are capable fo building the forces that can combat
state repression. Portugal and Spain are examples. We are many, they
are few.</p>
