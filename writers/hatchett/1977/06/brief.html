<p class="fst">TWO important new books on the history and practice of sexual
politics are published by Pluto this month. They will be reviewed
soon, as both raise issues that need clarifying and discussing today.
Sheila Rowbotham <B>A New World for Women: Stella Brown-Socialist
Feminist</B> (Pluto Press &pound;1.50), Sheila Rowbotham and Jeffrey
Weeks <B>Socialism and the New Life: The personal and sexual politics
of Edward Carpenter and Havelock Ellis</B> (Pluto Press &pound;1.80).</P>
<P>Virago have also produced a book that illuminates the history of
rank and file socialist and feminist struggles before the First World
War. <B>The Hard Way Up, The Auto-Biography of Hannah Mitchell
Suffragette and Rebel</B> (Virago &pound;1.75). A fascinating story.</P>
<P>Ken Coates, <B>Beyond Wage Slavery</B> (Spokesman Books &pound;2.45).
Boring and pretentious, this book is only of interest to those
comrades who take a (sectarian) pleasure in tracing the political
downfall of those they disagreed with in 1968.</P>
<P>Burchett and Roebuck, <B>The Whores Of War: Mercenaries Today</B>
(Penguin &pound;0.75). Despite sexist title and liberal politics an
interesting read, a book full of information that will be useful to
all who want to knwo about the realities of mercenaries today.</P>
<P>Bob Dixon, <B>Catching Them Young:</B> Vol.1: <B>Sex Race and
Class in children&rsquo;s Fiction</B>; Vol.2: <B>Political Ideas in
Children&rsquo;s Fiction</B> (Pluto Press, &pound;1.80 each). These
two volumes are published this month. They&rsquo;ll make a valuable
contribution to the debates among teachers and parents about the real
weight of ideological indoctrination that children suffer. Also new
from Penguin is Leon Kamin <B>The Science and Politics of I.Q.</B>
(95p). The American author attacks the notion that I.Q. is largely
inherited. He argues that the</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;I.Q. test has served as an instrument of
oppression against the poor, dressed in the trappings of science,
rather than politics.&rsquo;</p>
