<p class="fst">THE best book on the parliamentary road has not yet been written.
It would probably take the form of a present day <B>Pilgrims Progress</B>
in which our hero or heroine would stumble into Quagmires of
Illusions, Graveyards of Lost Souls, the Desert of Ward Committees,
be tempted by the Ogre of Corruption, be Axed by the Cuts, only to
end up dying of hypothermia in a miserable block of flats named after
Harold Wilson.</P>
<P>In the meantime, what can be read? Miliband&rsquo;s <B>Parliamentary
Socialism</B> (Merlin Press) tells the sad story of the Labour Party
from its earliest years to the late 1960&rsquo;s. David Coates tells
a similar tale in <B>The Labour Party and the Struggle For Socialism</B>
(Cambridge Univ. Press). Both titles have their limitations, but they
are the best histories of labourism available with Miliband&rsquo;s
much the more readable. Both provide an arsenal of facts and
arguments against reformism, gradualism, and the parliamentary road.</P>
<P>A more recent book deserving a wider audience is Leo Panitch&rsquo;s
<B>Social Democracy and Industrial Militancy</B> with the subtitle,
<I>The Labour Party, the Trade Unions and Incomes Policy 1945-1974</I>
(Cambridge &pound;8.50, so get it from your library). This is a
detailed study of Labour&rsquo;s commitment to capitalism, the Trade
Union Leaders commitment to Labour&rsquo;s commitment, and the
struggles of the rank and file.</P>
<P>For those who like the facts from the horse&rsquo;s mouth then
visit your library to look through Crosland&rsquo;s <B>The Future of
Socialism</B>, Harold&rsquo;s <B>Labour Government 1964-1970</B>, or
the more intimate <B>Confessions of a Cabinet Minister</B> by
Crossman. These are the works of the men who made it. For those who
didn&rsquo;t make it, generally to be found on the left of the PLP,
you might sample a very sad book by Eric Heffer, <B>The Class
Struggle in Parliament</B>.</P>
<P>Two more serious views that we must consider are Stuart Holland&rsquo;s
<B>The Socialist Challenge</B> (Quartet &pound;2.95) reviewed by
Colin Sparks in <B>IS 97</B>, and Ralph Miliband&rsquo;s article in
<B>Socialist Register 1976</B> (Merlin &pound;2.50). Holland belongs
to the more sophisticated state capitalist wing of the Labour Party,
whereas Miliband is one of the few survivors of a generation that
mainly slithered without trace into the Slough of Despond. Our
argument with their views have been taken up in this and recent
issues of <B>International Socialism</B>. The debate on the new draft
of <B>The British Road to Socialism</B> of the CPGB has highlighted
some of the important differences between reformist and revolutionary
paths. With the CPGB we meet the High Priests of Reformism for it is
they together with the Labour left who sow the illusions that have
paralysed so many good militants. Our task is to confront those
illusions head on, with the lessons of Chile and Portugal fresh in
our minds.</P>
