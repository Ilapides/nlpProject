<p class="fst">THE new Bookmarx Club has been launched successfully and its membership is growing day by day. Do not stop at joining yourself but encourage your friends and workmates to join as well. The club is great value, and most useful of all in the vast number of towns without a decent bookshop. Make one of your aims for 1977 the building of Mail Order Marxism. Write to: Bookmarx Club, Bookmarks. 265 Seven Sisters Rd, London N4.</p>

<p>Some recent titles of interest include <strong>Marx For Beginners</strong> by Rius, published Writers and Readers Publishing Cooperative at &#163;l.00, which will entertain some non-beginners but assumes too much for many beginners. <strong>Bad News</strong> by the Glasgow University Media Group (at &#163;5.95, so get it from your library) is a detailed study of the ways that the BBC and ITV distort the news, particularly in industrial disputes. It is published by Routledge and Kegan Paul. Bookmarks have asked me to mention that <strong>Shelley &#8211; The Pursuit</strong> by Richard Holmes is available in paperback at the very reasonable price of &#163;2.95.</p>

<p>New this month is <strong>Jack London: the Writer, the Rebel</strong> by Robert Barltrop (Pluto &#163;4.50 hardback only) to be reviewed in a subsequent issue.</p>

<p>Recently published is <strong>The Angry 30s</strong> by Julian Symons (Eyre Methuen, &#163;1.95), a lively photographic essay on the 1930s.</p>

<p>February sees the launching in Britain of the Pluto/Urizen parallel publishing programme. Urizen, a new US publishing house, are distributing all Pluto titles throughout North America. The first Urizen books available this month include the excellent novel <strong>The Life of the Automobile</strong> by Ilya Ehrenburg (&#163;2.70).</p>
