<h1>Swabeck in Minneapolis</h1>

<h3>(January 1932)</h3>

<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1932/index.htm#tm32_02" target="new">Vol. V No. 2 (Whole No. 98)</a>, 9 January 1932, p.&#160;2.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">After the successful banquet held last Saturday with comrade Swabeck for the joint benefit of the <strong>Militant</strong> and the new Jewish organ of the Left Opposition, two public lectures were held: one on the Plight of the MacDonald government in England with lessons for the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party, which was held right in the 11th Ward F.L.P. headquarters, and the other on the Role of the Left Opposition in the Present Crisis, held at the Labor Lyceum. Though the audience in both cases was not extraordinarily large, it was very attentive and interested in the message of the Opposition spokesman. The meetings were marked by serious questions and discussion from the floor, as well as by certain provocative heckling and speeches by the Stalinists, all of which gave comrade Swabeck an opportunity to deal concretely with the questions raised. One party member reiterated the argument that the Trotskyists were &#8220;individualists who would not abide by Communist discipline; and that furthermore, in the face of the mass work the party was doing, the Opposition did nothing but criticize the party.&#8221; It was obvious to all after Swabeck&#8217;s answer that the very participation of party members in our meetings were a recognition of the revolutionary work the Opposition is carrying on, and that our constructive criticism and conduct in the W.I.R. and the Mooney conference, etc., was rallying increasing numbers of workers to our standard.</p>

<p>In addition, comrade Swabeck addressed the Labor Lyceum Open Forum on the Manchurian Crisis and the Workers Open Forum on the Future of American Trade Unionism, the latter conducted every Sunday Afternoon, 3 p.m. at 1530 East Franklin Ave.</p>

<p>Nearly seventy dollars was raised from these meetings and a number of subscriptions to Opposition papers, especially to <strong>Unser Kamf</strong>, the new Jewish organ. We hope soon again to get a speaker from the National Center.</p>
