<p class="fst">CHICAGO. &#8211; The August 16th meeting of the County Central Committee witnessed the first shot in the campaign of the Clarity Group against the left wing here. Where under ordinary circumstances we were able to obtain a majority in the CCC by default (the absence of the representatives of the language branches for more than a year and a half), last night the Clarity leaders made the round-up. With the representatives of the numerous Jugoslav branches present they had a majority.</p>

<p>Utilizing this majority they proceeded to upset the actions of the CCC meeting of July on technical grounds of an extremely tenuous kind. McDowell, the &#8220;constitutional expert&#8221; falsely interpreted the local constitution as requiring a semi-annual election of delegates to the CCC (it called only for a reapportionment), moved to reconsider the actions of the July meeting on the ground that the meeting was illegal. The real reason for his action lay in the fact that the July meeting elected Satir to the County Central Executive Committee in place of Ben Fisher who is now in Detroit. Utilizing an old agreement made at the time of the elections to the CEC, the Clarity group demanded that Satir first decline in favor of McDowell on the ground that he represented the same tendency as Fisher and should replace him. This proposal Satir correctly rejected and because he did so and ran and was elected, the &#8220;Clarity group determined to &#8220;show him a lesson&#8221;.</p>
