<p class="fst">The response to the New York May Day issue of <strong>Labor Action</strong> exceeded our greatest hopes. Some four thousand copies have been completely sold, making it impassible for the business office to meet the many requests that have come in from cities for additional bundle orders. The same is true for individuals who have not yet subscribed seeking copies of the special issue.</p>

<p>The May 15th number marks the first' regular edition of <strong>Labor Action</strong> as the official weekly organ of the Workers Party. It will feature news on the second world war, labor articles, analytical stories on economic conditions in the United States, the problems of the workers political movement and special educational features.</p>

<p>No workingman interested in the welfare of labor will want to be without <strong>Labor Action</strong>. The only guarantee for receiving the paper regularly is to subscribe, and do it right away! In that way you will know that the paper is yours every week. Subscription rates are listed in another column.</p>

<p>In a very short time we shall list the places in various cities where you will be able to purchase our paper. Such distribution centers are being set up now.</p>

<p>Any workingman who desire to avail himself of a small bundle for distribution among his shopmates can obtain it by writing in to the [words missing].</p>
