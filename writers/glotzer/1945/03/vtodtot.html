<p class="fst">The President has shuffled his infield around, but the players are still the same. Judge Fred M. Vinson has been moved up from his post as Director of Stabilization to the place once held to by Jesse Jones as custodian of the billion dollar loan agency of the government.</p>

<p>Lawyer William H. Davis first limbered up a little and took Vinson&#8217;s place as Director of Stabilization.</p>

<p>Dr. Charles W. Taylor then stepped into Davis&#8217; post as chairman of the War Labor Board.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Nothing Has Been Changed!</h4>

<p class="fst">What, if anything, has been changed by the new set-up? Nothing!</p>

<p><em>Before departing his post as Director of Stabilization, Vinson, who had already barred any increase in the basic wage rates of the American workers, made rulings on fringe demands which have approximately the same aim: preventing an equitable adjustment in wages. That makes it a little easier for Mr. Davis, Who can now excuse himself on the ground that Judge Vinson has firmly established the policy of his department. But Mr. Davis does not need any excuse.</em></p>

<p>Before he departed his post as chairman of the WLB, Mr. Davis handed in a report to the President advising no revision in the Little Steel formula &#8211; no increase in the basic wages of the workers, even though he and his cohorts admitted that the cost of living was at least eleven per cent above any wage increases granted workers. To make certain that no fight over his new appointment would arise, he made a public statement upon his nomination that he was not in favor of wage increases!</p>

<p>And now we come to the new chairman of the WLB, Dr. Charles W. Taylor. <em>He is well qualified to fill Davis&#8217; shoes, since he is the author of the infamous Little Steel formula which is destroying the living standards of millions of American workers.</em> Dr. Taylor further distinguished himself by helping to write the report to the President urging the maintenance of the wage freeze and no change in the Little Steel formula.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h2>Labor&#8217;s Path</h2>

<p class="fst">Thus the men now responsible for maintaining the President&#8217;s stabilization program (read: wage freeze), are two gentlemen who have made it all too clear that they are against any upward revision of the Little Steel formula, against any increase in the basic wage structure and for the maintenance of the wage freeze!</p>

<p>Bad men, say the labor leaders. &#8220;Intolerable,&#8221; says Phil Murray, head of the CIO. But Davis and Taylor are not acting on their own! They are acting in the name of President Roosevelt!</p>

<p><em>President Roosevelt appointed these men to their posts!</em></p>

<p><em>President Roosevelt appointed them because he knows they will be faithful to his program and will carry it out completely!</em></p>

<p>The lesson is clearer than ever, even if the labor officialdoms prefer not to see it:</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>LABOR SHOULD GET OFF THE WLB.</strong></p>

<p class="fst"><strong>LABOR SHOULD RESCIND THE NO-STRIKE PLEDGE AS AN INSTRUMENT WHICH BINDS ITS HANDS AND MAKES IMPOSSIBLE A STRUGGLE FOR HIGHER WAGES AND THE MAINTENANCE OF A DECENT STANDARD OF LIVING.</strong></p>
