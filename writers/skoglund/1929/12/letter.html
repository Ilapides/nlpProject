<p class="fst">Dear Comrades:</p>

<p class="fst">The League in Minneapolis is carrying on real good work, which will bring in many new members from among the American workers. We are about to start a campaign to organize the general drivers into unions. We have very good connections in this particular industry. We are also carrying on work among the cab drivers with good results. A Left wing has been developed in the Amalgamated which meets regularly and has excellent connections.</p>

<p>The defense movement is going on fairly good with prospects of more mass support in the future.</p>

<p>Two classes have been organized by the League&#8212;one in the <em>A.B.C. of Communism</em> and the other on <em>American labor history</em>.</p>

<p>The Party is back in its underground days and is issuing manifestos and leaflets like then, only this time they are not numbered. The last one was about us &#8220;splitting&#8221; the labor defense when we tried to work with them and were expelled. I am called traitor, renegade and accused of making alliances with S.P., City Hall prosecutors, and A.F. of L. labor fakers. These leaflets are doing the Communist movement untold harm and the workers class the members of the Party as a bunch of crazy people. It will take years to live down these blunders.</p>
