<p class="fst">SYRACUSE &ndash; This wide open-shop industrial center is all primed for big war-time production. General Motors, Crucible Steel, Solvay chemicals long ago &ldquo;adapted&rsquo;&rsquo; themselves to the &ldquo;strain&rdquo; of war.</p>

<p>War means open-shop wages. Syracuse anticipated this general condition by many years. A skilled tool and die maker in Brown, Lipe &amp; Shapin (GM affiliate manufacturing steering, gears, headlights, etc.) makes less than a dollar an hour tops. In the unionized plants of GM the same work calls for $1.25 to $1.40 an hour. Naturally, proportionately worse conditions obtain for the unskilled.</p>

<p>And while wages trail far behind unionized plants, and hours are long and working conditions bad, Syracuse workers already have the bad smell in their nostrils &ndash; the smell of the pre-war depression that will be the postwar panic.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The &ldquo;Democracy&rdquo; They Enjoy</h4>

<p class="fst">Over 9,000 families are on relief, according to Leon Abbott, county welfare commissioner. At least one out of every seven persons receive relief &ndash; which is a sure sign that at least one out of every six are unemployed.</p>

<p>These families, fortunate enough to be on the relief rolls, received $6.32 on the weekly average. Estimating the families at an average of 4 persons, the relief cannon-fodder of Syracuse enjoy the princely sum of 90 cents a day for food, clothing, shelter, fuel and the other necessities of life. They will probably be branded &ldquo;Fifth Column&rdquo; if they don&rsquo;t get too hysterical about the Morgan-DuPont-Roosevelt war for &ldquo;democracy,&rdquo; &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; and &ldquo;the good life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not very long ago the local newspapers and the Chamber of Commerce were engaged in a big crusade against &ldquo;Bolshevism.&rdquo;. The &ldquo;Bolshevism&rdquo; consisted of a low-cost housing project that succeeded in providing the tremendous number of 800 apartments. (There are almost 10,000 slum families in Syracuse.) But even this &ldquo;wild-eyed Bolsheviki&rdquo; project was not entirely unprofitable for the solid citizens of the community. It appeals that the slums were cleared for the project in <em>NOT</em> the poorest section of the city. These homes &ndash; of course! &ndash; were heavily mortgaged to the local banks, who were not entirely unhappy to relieve themselves of this property, at nice fat interest charges.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Workers Are Militant</h4>

<p class="fst">With the exception of the militant truck drivers and a few of the minor trades, Syracuse is unorganized. There are a few weak SWOC lodges in the Crucible mills, a few of the smaller plants and mills under contract. And that&rsquo;s about the size of organization. But don&rsquo;t get the impression that Syracuse workers lack in militancy. For months on end the Remington-Rand workers battled as vicious a company terror as workers have seen anywhere. They didn&rsquo;t win &ndash; the labor movement was to weak and the company too powerful. But the real story is told in the fact that the only way Remington-Rand could defeat the workers was by closing down the plant.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Hell will pop in this town one of these days,&rdquo; a worker told me, &ldquo;and when it does we&rsquo;ll be fighting our own war where it should be fought.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">The SWP is ready to move ahead in Syracuse. With several workers joining the party during my stay here, it is only a matter of time before an active, promising party organization is constituted.</p>
