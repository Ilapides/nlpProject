<p class="fst">The Executive Council of the American Federation of Labor has
finished its grave deliberations under the warm Florida sun. It
labored and labored and produced &ndash; a mouse that even the rodent
family would be ashamed to claim its own.</p>

<p>With good whiskey and mellow cigars plentiful, the punjabs of
America&rsquo;s craft unions leaned back in their plushy hotel chairs
and pondered the state of the nation. They found</p>

<p>conditions deplorable. The depression is still with us after ten
years &ndash; lingering on like a bad dream. Capital lies idle by the
billions in the banks. Business stagnates, there is no expansion,
factories are idle. Ten millions are unemployed. And with it all, the
nation teeters on the brink of war.</p>

<p>In other words, which no one can deny: America remains in the
death grip of the most intense social crisis in its history.
Patch-work schemes won&rsquo;t work any more. This is a time,
obviously, for bold men with bold programs. The leaders of 4,000,000
workers, who are most seriously affected by the crisis, should call
out the might of organized labor for immediate aggressive action.</p>

<p>They should, yes &ndash; but the old, old men of the Executive
Council have another idea of what should be done and how. For them
the proverb &ldquo;discretion is the better part of valor&rdquo; is a
hoary principle frozen in their bones. To the waiting world they
uttered solemn words:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;Unemployment still is the most acute domestic
problem of the nation ... the American Federation of Labor refuses to
accept the idea of chronic or permanent unemployment ... We believe
that a democracy owes a basic obligation to its Citizens to provide
them with opportunity to work and achieve a progressively higher
standard of living ... The AFL calls upon both political parties to
incorporate in their platforms this year a constructive program for
the elimination of widespread unemployment.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">And what is this constructive program ? <em>&ldquo;... find out the
facts and face them courageously ... Ascertain just how many men and
women willing and able to work are unemployed through no fault of
their own ... Find out the extent of unemployment among our youth and
among middle aged workers.&rdquo;</em> In short: take a census. The
government should easily comply with this demand as this is census
year. Cut a notch in the Council&rsquo;s belt. The victory is already
won.</p>

<p>But what then? <em>&ldquo;... provide jobs for the unemployed in
private industry.&rdquo;</em> Noble thought. But how, when in the
words of the Council <em>&ldquo;... there are not enough jobs to go
around&rdquo;</em>?</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;We demand,&rdquo;</em> the Executive Council
whispers meekly after Tom Dewey and Senator Vandenberg, <em>&ldquo;that
those in authority take whatever steps may be necessary to restore
business confidence. We urge that all government actions that tend to
discourage business expansion cease ...&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">Yes, yes, we heard that before. The Republican National Committee,
the National Manufacturers Ass&rsquo;n, the American Chamber of
Commerce has been dinning that tune in our ears for a decade. But
what about the unemployed, the jobs, the idle factories? <em>&ldquo;...
we urge Congress to create a national advisory council on
unemployment which would have representatives of government,
business, labor and consumers. Such a council could bring about unity
of purpose and unity of action on a constructive program.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>But suppose the members of the council couldn&rsquo;t agree among
themselves? Suppose labor is voted down by &ldquo;business&rdquo; and
&ldquo;government&rdquo;? Suppose labor doesn&rsquo;t like the
program? Suppose there is a lot of speeches and no program? Ah, well!
A fine effort but perhaps the times are not auspicious for &ldquo;unity
of action&rdquo; and &ldquo;unity of purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Patience! There is something positive.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;Organized labor has long felt that the shorter
work week without decreases in pay provides a positive and
progressive offset to the natural displacement of workers by the
introduction of labor-saving machinery.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">How is this most necessary step to be obtained ? Action, strikes,
demonstrations? Take it easy, brother! This is the Executive Council
of the American Federation of Labor. <em>&ldquo;The AFL will continue
to press for the five-day week and the six hour day.&rdquo;</em> And
that&rsquo;s that.</p>

<p>Four days later, apparently slowly recovering from the shock of
this radical declaration, ten leaders, led by Hutcheson and Wohl,
unlimbered 5,000 solid words of Republican indignation on the New
Deal. The statement bears the startling title: <em>A Call for United
Action</em>.</p>

<p>There has been too much &ldquo;tinkering&rdquo; with business.
Public confidence has been destroyed. The poor banks have been forced
to finance the government. This unrestricted &ldquo;experimentation&rdquo;
has provoked strikes and labor strife. Taxes are much, much too high
&ndash; in fact the suffering Sixty Families are being bled to death.
Too many g&mdash;&mdash;m radicals, too much &ldquo;innovating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the question of war, the Council was united. &ldquo;The US
(must) maintain strict neutrality and keep out of European wars.&rdquo;
Not a word, however, about Roosevelt&rsquo;s hurried moves towards US
entry into the war, not a word about turning the US into an Allied
arsenal, not a word about the American zones of continental
influence, not a word about the huge armaments programs, not a word
about the M- Day plans to strangle the labor unions.</p>

<p>But there was &ldquo;condemnation of Soviet-Nazi imperialism&rdquo;
&ndash; in line with the ideological preparations for intervention on
the side of the Allies. There was an exhortation to the government to
extend a loan to Finland to purchase arms and war materials in this
country. Green and Co. join with both feet in the anti-Soviet
crusade.</p>

<p>A touch of progressivism was added to the deliberations by the
strong onslaught on Thurman Arnold, who was condemned in bitter terms
for invading the independence of the trade union movement.
Nevertheless, the statement shied away from placing blame where it
properly belongs &ndash; Franklin Delano Roosevelt, initiator and
instigator of the &ldquo;anti-trust&rdquo; prosecutions against the
unions.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">That&rsquo;s the story of another AFL executive council meeting.
The one potentially progressive act that took place was the fight
between Dan Tobin and the arch-reactionary Hutcheson. All the
newspapers report is that Tobin challenged Hutcheson&rsquo;s right to
the No.&nbsp;1 seat on the council, and that it nearly came to a fist
fight. Undoubtedly, however, other issues are involved, which may
become public at next week&rsquo;s meeting of the executive board of
the international Brotherhood of Teamsters. Tobin is reported
threatening to take the teamsters out of the AFL. That step,
considering the enormous power of the teamsters, might under certain
conditions weigh the scales decisively in favor of the CIO. It&rsquo;s
a pity that Hutcheson and Tobin didn&rsquo;t actually come to blows,
as Hutcheson did with Lewis at the San Francisco convention over the
CIO issue.</p>
