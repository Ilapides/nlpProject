<p class="fst"><strong>KANSAS CITY</strong> &#8211; A successful mass meeting, with an attendance of 50 workers, was held in Kansas City on December 18, when comrade Arne Swabeck spoke on the <em>Economic Crisis and the Communists</em>. The talk was very well received and aroused a greater interest in the program and work of the Communist League (Opposition). The Stalinists, who are askance at the development of, as they call it, &#8220;A Trotskyist Center&#8221; in Kansas City, set to work to hinder the meeting. At first they boasted they would send their &#8220;big guns&#8221; to heckle the speaker but none of them showed up. But several Party rank and file members did attend, despite the intimidation and order by the Stalinist bureaucrats not to attend the meeting. The meeting gave an impetus to the Opposition Open Forum which is soon to begin.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday night a banquet was held. A good time was had by all and a collection was taken up to aid in the work.</p>

<p>The study class in the <em>Fundamentals of Communism</em> is now well under way. The class, conducted by comrade Geo. Clarke, has ten members with good prospects for growth. Those wishing to join should get in touch with George Clarke, care of Buehler&#8217;s Bookstore, 220 West 12th Street, Kansas City, Mo.</p>
