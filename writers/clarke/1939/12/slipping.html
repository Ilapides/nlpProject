<h1>Stalinist Hold Slipping in CIO Unions</h1>

<h4>Brophy Joins Witch Hunt; South Bend Demands Ouster</h4>

<h3>(23 December 1939)</h3>

<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/socialist-appeal-1939/index.htm#sa03_94" target="new">Vol. III No. 94</a>, 23 December 1939, pp.&nbsp;1 &amp;&nbsp;3.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="fst"><em>The Stalinists have been walking a tightrope in the unions
since the Hitler-Stalin pact. We said that in the <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>
two months ago on the occasion of Lewis&rsquo; announcement of the
CIO purge. In the last two weeks several prominent Stalinist
performers have fallen off the tightrope and into the net of the
official bureaucracy.</em></p>

<p><em>First is the case of John Brophy. A few days ago Brophy turned
up at a convention of the CIO United Retail and Wholesale Employees
in Detroit and denounced the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany in the
same breath.</em> Speaking as a representative of John L. Lewis, he
said:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;We condemn the brutality of a Nazi Germany on
the march and we condemn a Soviet Union turned imperialistic.&rdquo;</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Brophy&rsquo;s Record</h4>

<p class="fst">Brophy was one of the leading Stalinists caucus engineers in the
top circles of the C.I.O. The job of replacing good progressive
organizers with incompetent and bureaucratic Stalinist agents was one
of his special assignments. The defense of Communist party
dictatorships in the CIO unions against the revolt of the rank and
file was another little duty he performed. It was Brophy who
engineered the appointment of Harry Bridges as west coast CIO
regional director which resulted in driving out the progressive
Sailors Union, splitting the labor movement there wide open and
plunging it into the most violent internecine struggle.</p>

<p>Brophy&rsquo;s defection is a major blow for the Stalinists. For
the progressive rank and file, however it can only mean the weakening
of the Kremlin bureaucracy and the strengthening of the
Roosevelt-Lewis bureaucracy. Brophy, as his jingo statement
indicates, will be no less faithful in the service of Lewis than he
was in the service of the Stalinists.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>South Bend Sours on C.P.</h4>

<p class="fst">The second defection is that of the South Bend CIO Industrial
Union Council. A resolution was presented by the Studebaker Local 5,
United Automobile Workers of America, and unanimously carried by the
Council on Dec. 6. denouncing Stalin&rsquo;s invasion of Finland,
urging that the Communist Party be removed from the ballot in state,
county and Federal elections and prohibiting any &ldquo;known member
of the communistic party from holding office in any St. Joseph county
CIO local or any CIO affiliate which may exist in said county.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chickens are coming home to roost &ndash; with a vengeance.
South Bend was a stronghold of the Stalinists almost since the
inception of the CIO. The Studebaker local was considered their
private property. Now in the mass revulsion and disgust with
Stalinism, the movement is catapulted in a reactionary direction.
Beginning with justified indignation against Stalin&rsquo;s criminal
methods in Finland, the resolution concludes, however, with a
denunciation of the Soviet Union in the same words as the reactionary
capitalist press: &ldquo;the ideological brothers of the maniac
Hitler and his crew of gangsters who now rule Germany ... a policy of
unlimited aggression and imperialistic methods.&rdquo; And finally
the resolution reaches the reactionary conclusion of the Dies
Committee: outlaw the Communist party.</p>

<p>Stalinism waged a war against militants find progressives in the
trade unions. Its methods and policies fed the most reactionary
barrage. But we warn the progressives not to hop from the Stalinist
frying pan into the reactionary fire.</p>

<p>A third blow for the Stalinists was the defection of the top
leaders of the Communist Party fraction of Local 22 of the
International Ladies Garment Workers Union in New York. Expelled from
the Communist Party were: Ben Gerjoy, Sol Lipniak, Hyman Grossman,
Meyer Kravetz &ndash; all business agents; Morris Rosenberg,
executive board member and Abe Pell and Isidore Gross &ndash;
adjustors.</p>

<p>The official C.P. statement on the expulsion accuses the expelled
of &ldquo;wavering in the face of the war danger.&rdquo; The
statement of the expelled counters with an accusation that the
Stalinists demanded they put their party interests over the interests
of the union. Neither statement tells the story.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>End of the &ldquo;United Front&rdquo;</h4>

<p class="fst">The statement of the expelled says nothing about the Stalin-Hitler
pact, nor about Stalin&rsquo;s invasion of Finland, nor about their
stand on the pro-ally resolution of the American Labor Party. But
their opposition to the Stalinists is a direct result of these
events. Up until the Stalin-Hitler pact and the new turn of the
Communist party the expelled business agents, following the Stalinist
line, were in a united front administration with the Lovestoneite
manager of the local, Charles S. Zimmerman. They were preparing a
united front slate again with Zimmerman prior to the Stalin-Hitler
pact. Under the conditions of the &ldquo;new line&rdquo; they were
instructed to break with Zimmerman and go into opposition. They
balked. Hence the expulsion.</p>

<p>Zimmerman says in a statement that the &ldquo;new line&rdquo; of
the Stalinists &ldquo;is most injurious.&rdquo; True. But was the old
line, the rotten popular front that made the unions an adjunct of the
War Deal Roosevelt administration any less injurious? Or is the mere
fact of unity with the Zimmerman administration sufficient to &ldquo;make
them (the business agents) more welcome to the dressmakers&rdquo;?<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Which Way Now?</h4>

<p class="fst">By breaking with the Stalinists, the business agents took a step
in the right direction. But that was an easy step at a time when
Stalinism is as popular as a crateful of skunks. The question is:
where do they stand today? Obviously, their denial of the infamous
Stalinist charge is true. The C.P. charged they had &ldquo;deserted
to the camp of the Lovestoneites, Trotskyites, and Social Democrats,
the pro-war, Redbaiting stooges of the bosses and the Dies Committee
against the best interests of the working class.&rdquo; Only an
Egyptian contortionist could possibly get into all those camps at the
same time &ndash; and even he would have his difficulties.</p>

<p>Having denounced the Stalinists, the expelled business agents owe
the class conscious workers an answer on their position towards the
social patriots of the I.L.G.W. administration. Have
you broken with the Stalinist war camp to join the camp of the
Allies and Roosevelt? Or have you joined the Third Camp of struggle
against imperialist war?</p>

<p>The progressive workers will judge all those who break from
Stalinism by their answer to these questions.</p>
