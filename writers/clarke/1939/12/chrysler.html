<p class="fst">The agreement signed by the Chrysler Corporation and the United
Automobile Workers (CIO) ending the 54-day &ldquo;lockout&rdquo;
represents a major development for the American labor movement. The
calamity-howlers, who have been predicting the death of the CIO and
its proudest acquisition, the auto workers union, received a major
disappointment. Confronted with a major attack by one of the &ldquo;Big
Three&rdquo; of the auto industry, the UAW-CIO emerged from the
conflict a formidable power.</p>

<p>The Chrysler Corporation entertained some extravagant illusions
regarding the union. The auto barons believed &ndash; they hoped &ndash;
that the union had been weakened and disintegrated by years of
internal struggle and unemployment. Hence, they concluded, if we lock
the workers out at a time when production is high, the workers will
desert their organizations and even march through picket lines to get
in a few months of steady pay.</p>

<p>The corporation was prepared to lose millions in profits at the
peak of the season if the backbone of the union could be broken. The
infamous Mohawk Valley formula was trotted out of the dusty files.
Every faucet of propaganda was turned on full force. Full page paid
advertisements appeared daily in the local press. Business and
professional men were circularized by mail with a wad of lies about
the alleged crimes of the union. Chrysler dealers were squeezed into
a denunciation of the UAW. The fascist spielers, Coughlin and Gerald
L.K. Smith, were amply provided with funds to pour their venom
against the workers over the radio. A huge meeting was called to
organize fascist gangs. A back-to-work movement, with Homer Martin
and his scab AFL outfit in the leadership, was launched several
times. Misguided Negro workers were led through the picket line in an
attempt to provoke a race riot. Even doddering Governor Dickinson was
dragged off his knees long enough to threaten National Guard
assistance to strikebreakers.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Company Plans Break on Union Rock</h4>

<p class="fst">And yet &ndash; all of Chrysler&rsquo;s plans went wrong. The
union remained solid as a rock. Despite five weeks of privation,
denied unemployment insurance by a Chrysler stooge committee, denied
relief except in the most miserly allotments, the ranks of the
Chrysler workers were unbreakable. Every rumor of scab movements
brought thousands of workers to the picket line before the Dodge main
plant. Only a few days before the agreement was signed, 10,000
workers formed the largest strike line ever seen in Detroit. Fifty
thousand auto workers jammed Cadillac Square when it appeared the
corporation would take aggressive strikebreaking steps.</p>

<p>The frontal attack of the auto barons was smashed decisively by
the Chrysler workers. Unanswerable proof was given in this battle
that the lesson of unionism has been burned so deeply into former
&ldquo;hillbillies&rdquo; and &ldquo;farmers&rdquo; that only a
veritable civil war can bring a return to the open shop days. The
automobile workers union is a tower of strength after the Chrysler
strike and no boss in the auto industry will henceforth lightly play
with the notion that he can break the union by &ldquo;old-fashioned&rdquo;
methods.</p>

<p>The defeat of Chrysler plans is a great positive achievement. The
agreement resulting from the struggle, on the other hand, cannot be
viewed in such unqualified terms.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What the Union Actually Got</h4>

<p class="fst">What did the union get? How close did the union approach these
demands after 54 days of the lockout? When considering the settlement
it must be borne in mind that a union very rarely gets everything it
asks for in a strike. But the extent of the compromise is usually
determined by the strength of the union at the time of the
settlement. The ranks of the UAW were intact in the Chrysler
&ldquo;lockout&rdquo;, the picket lines were the largest ever seen in
Detroit on the eve of the settlement.</p>

<p>The corporation granted a general three cents an hour wage
increase. The union had demanded a 10 per cent wage increase. Only a
few classifications received this increase.</p>

<p>The corporation granted sole collective bargaining to the UAW. The
union asked for the &ldquo;union shop&rdquo;. It had already won
&ldquo;sole collective bargaining&rdquo; by the huge majority vote it
polled in the NLRB election before the lockout.</p>

<p>The corporation conceded an improved grievance procedure whereby a
committee of two from the management and two from the union are to
render decisions on grievances within 30 days from the time they are
submitted. The union asked for a voice in setting production
standards. The company rejected this demand and returned the
procedure described above which union leaders claim rectify previous
abuses.</p>

<p>The new agreement abolishes the &ldquo;no-strike&rdquo; clause.
Under its terms a strike may be called five days after the union has
complied with all the steps of the grievance procedure. This is a
decided advantage from a propaganda point of view. In the past the
corporation could charge the union with &ldquo;irresponsibility&rdquo;
and violation of the agreement when the company made a strike
inescapable.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>No Gains on Seniority Issue</h4>

<p class="fst">The union did not get the six weeks seniority clause. New workers,
mostly young militant elements, have little opportunity to establish
the six months seniority required by the agreement as it stands now.
This will not enhance the popularity of the union among thousands of
young workers who attribute &ndash; falsely &ndash; their failure to
get steady jobs to union regulations.</p>

<p>The union did not get the &ldquo;war seniority&rdquo; provision.
It did not get the vacation with pay. This gain had been won by
smaller and weaker local unions, in the Bohn Aluminum and Packard
plants, through a two and one- half per cent yearly bonus.</p>

<p>To summarize: the union gained some substantial improvements in
bargaining procedure and some slight concessions in wages. And that&rsquo;s
all.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Leaders Frightened by FDR Pressure</h4>

<p class="fst">It is clear from a comparison of the terms of the settlement with
the original demands that Philip Murray, Frankensteen and Thomas
traded too much of the workers&rsquo; demands. The leadership of the
union was frightened by the pressure of the War Deal administration.
Murray rushed into Detroit to conclude any kind of settlement quickly
so long as only a few concessions could be gained to justify it in
the workers&rsquo; eyes. The workers were ready to fight. The CIO
leadership was prepared to capitulate. The ranks were not organized
to push the leadership. Hence the settlement on poor terms, far below
those&rsquo; which might have been gained from the struggle.</p>

<p>Why, then, did the workers vote in their local unions with such
unanimity for the acceptance of the agreement? It is not enough to
say that they lacked leadership of their own. Spontaneous resistance
would have certainly arisen under other circumstances. In these
conditions lies the significance of the Chrysler strike from a
broader standpoint.</p>

<p>The workers did not feel that the demands pressed by the union
leadership over the conference table warranted a continuation of the
struggle. The workers wanted the thirty-hour week at forty hours&rsquo;
pay as they so overwhelmingly indicated at the UAW convention last
April. Conditions of permanent unemployment for a large section of
auto workers and only intermittent employment for those more
fortunate, put the 30-hour week at the very heart of the auto workers
struggles. The UAW leadership has not lifted a finger &ndash; besides
a few articles in the <strong>United Auto Worker</strong> &ndash; to fight for
this demand &ndash; since the convention.</p>

<p>The auto workers wanted a substantial increase in wages. This
demand was buried for almost the entire duration of the &ldquo;lockout&rdquo;
and finally raised towards the last few days in the public press but
only in a horsetrading manner. To force a ten per cent wage increase
for the Chrysler workers it was necessary to organize a <em>militant
strike</em>. The UAW leaders surrendered this policy for the dubious
advantage of unemployment insurance. Which the workers didn&rsquo;t
get.</p>

<p>The real demands were lost in the loud publicity of the union for
a union shop and a voice in control of production. But the workers
were completely baffled when, after a few days, the negotiating
committee publicly announced that they had withdrawn both these
demands.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The New Strategy of the Bosses</h4>

<p class="fst">What then was the struggle about? That was precisely the question
the corporation was attempting to get the workers to ask. The same
strategy was used in the General Motors strike early last summer. The
workers were out on strike for several weeks. They got only a few
minor concessions in the agreement &ndash; and for that matter the
original demands did not represent the basic improvements required by
the workers.</p>

<p>The corporations are laying the groundwork by this strategy for a
mass revulsion against the unions. They throw the onus for the long
weeks of privation on the unions, and at the conclusion when they
refuse to grant decent concessions, they ask the question: what do
you get out of the union but a swift kick in the teeth?</p>

<p>It is a futile business at attempt to counteract this propaganda
by foaming at the mouth at company lies. The workers want results.
They are willing to fight, but they want their fights to be fruitful.
They are ready to be defeated, if necessary, if only the struggle is
organized on real basic demands.</p>

<p>The corporations are preparing a tremendous debacle for the auto
workers. The union leadership by its weak, vacillating and
capitulationist policy is facilitating the game of the auto Barons.</p>

<p>Only a rank and file progressive organization of auto workers can
force the UAW leadership to organize the auto workers&rsquo;
struggles on the basis of bold demands, can carry the struggles
through militantly and defeat the bosses on the major issues of the
day.</p>

<p>The rank and file must begin.</p>
