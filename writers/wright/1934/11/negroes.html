<p class="fst">NEGROES in the United States in 1930 numbered about
11,900,000. About 80% live in 16 southern states and the District of
Columbia.</p>
<p>Historically the Negro was rural and agricultural. He was primarily
a cultivator of cotton. Since the center of the cotton area is in the
South, the Negro population was from the very beginning concentrated
there. In this sense it is still correct to speak of the Negro as
primarily &#8220;southern&#8221;. In approaching the Negro problem these historical
aspects have been stressed more than sufficiently, but the profound
changes that have taken place among the Negroes during the last few
decades have been neglected almost completely.</p>
<p>Originally, the history of the Negro in America was the history of
cotton. But today, it is an anachronism to view the Negro as primarily
a backward farmer confined to cotton areas. In this sense it is no
longer correct to speak of the Negro as primarily &#8220;southern&#8221;. The
history of the Negro has become directly linked with modern industry.
He has been separated from the soil and suddenly placed in the midst of
the complex modern industrial structure. This is a fact. And,
obviously, it is necessary to establish this fact because a tendency
still prevails to view the Negro, especially the southern Negro, in
terms of those conditions that prevailed at the outbreak of the Civil
War, and in the period immediately following. The Negro, especially the
southern Negro, is no longer overwhelmingly agricultural.</p>
<p>In 1860 the Negroes were most densely concentrated in the South,
particularly within the boundaries of six cotton-growing states,
Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Louisiana and Arkansas.
Naturally enough these states then could serve as a focus in any
consideration of the Negro problem. In 1860 what was true of the
Negroes in these states applied largely to the Negroes of the entire
South, who comprised more than 92% of the total Negro population, and
who were overwhelmingly agricultural. But to take these six states as
our point of departure today can lead only to most grievous errors. The
profound economic changes that the South underwent following the Civil
War met with the greatest inertia precisely in these states. To this
day they have remained predominantly agricultural with cotton still the
main crop. (They produced 63% of the cotton crop in 1930.) Only within
this area have the Negroes remained largely rural and agricultural.</p>
<p>The Negro population has been becoming urbanized (i.e.
proletarianized) at an ever increasing tempo. For three decades
following the Civil War, for the US as a whole, it remained rural and
agricultural (in 1890, it was 80.6% rural and only 19.4% urban); in the
three decades following, and particularly in the last decade the trend
has been toward towns and cities. In 1920 the shift was to 66% rural
and 34%; urban; in 1930 the shift was much more accentuated, 56.3%
rural, 43.7% urban. The shift was by no means restricted solely to the
North. In 1930 the number of Negroes living in southern cities exceeded
those in northern cities. Concurrently, while the Negro population was
growing in other states (southern as well as northern), the Negro
population in this <em>Old South</em> area remained stationary over a
period of decades. The Negro population of these six states was in 1910

&#8211; 5,087,000; in 1920 &#8211; 5,079,000; in 1930 &#8211; 5,073,000. During the same
period the Negro population in the US had increased more than 20%. This
clearly denotes an intense migration from these agricultural states
into industrial sections. However, it should not be concluded that
deep-going changes have not been occurring within the Old South itself.
Here too, the industrial development has been making gigantic strides
forward, breaking down the old economic structure, and the original
economic differentiation between the industrial North and the
agricultural South. The development has been uneven, but the same
process has been going on here as elsewhere, only at a different rate.
The historical cultural and economic conditions of the Old South tended
to retard the process. What has most tended to obscure its actual
course is the fact that even today more than 42% of the total Negro
population still lives within the boundaries of these six states. In
1910 the same area held 51.7% of the total Negro population.</p>
<p>More than two-thirds of the total Negro farmers in the South and
almost three-fourths of the tenant farmers are to be found in these
same six states. A study limited to this area must necessarily fail to
reflect the fundamental changes in Negro life.</p>
<p>From the density of the Negro population within this area,
conclusions have been drawn that are highly fallacious, particularly
the conclusions that the Negro problem is primarily geographic, i.e.,
southern, and agricultural, and therefore a &#8220;national&#8221; problem. Flowing
from this, the attempt is made to reduce the entire problem to the
analysis of only this particular section of the South, the famous
&#8220;Black Belt&#8221; sector. For the core of this sector stretches precisely
over the states we have been discussing. Just as it is possible to draw
any kind of a triangle within a circle, so it is possible to construct
within this territory a particular &#8220;well defined area&#8221; in which the
Negroes would compose the majority of the population. But just as what
applies to the inscribed triangle need not apply to the circle, just so
what applies to this particular sector need not apply at all elsewhere.
Such a sector may be, and in this case it actually is, arbitrary and
artificial. In the first place the &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; embraces a territory
that has remained primarily rural and overwhelmingly agricultural;
secondly, even according to the most sanguine estimates it includes
only about 3,000,000 Negroes, or approximately one-fourth of the total
Negro population. Even the Stalinists claim for it only &#8220;some 3,320,000
Negroes&#8221;. The &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; is a very arbitrary sort of a belt. The six
states over which the core of it extends comprise about 500 counties,
with a population of 8 million whites and 5 million Negroes, that is,
61.5% white. To obtain a &#8220;solid area&#8221; in which the Negroes form the
majority of the population, it is necessary to select particular
counties which must be contiguous. Some 200 counties can be squeezed
into this requirement. The most imposing picture of the &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; is
painted by the Stalinists. Yet even they claim for it only that, &#8220;In
192 counties they made up from 50% to 75% of the population; in 36
counties they comprise more than 75% of the population&#8221; (<strong>Labor
Fact Book</strong>, p.78. Figures based on 1920 census).</p>

<p>Leaving aside for the moment all other considerations it is obvious
that one cannot equate even the actual area over which the bulk of the
Negroes is spread &#8211; some 24 states including the District of Columbia &#8211;
with a handpicked area of 192 counties, in which the whites compose an
insignificant minority only in 36. Moreover such a belt, to be
consistent, must exclude the remaining 300 counties in which there are <em>only</em>
about 2 million Negroes. It also throws out of focus not only the
millions of northern Negroes, but also a greater southern population
than the one actually included, some 3,300,000 Negroes in the directly
adjoining states of Texas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and
Florida, in which there are 11,460,000 whites. Needless to say, the
constructors of &#8220;Black Belts&#8221; do not and cannot remain consistent with
their own premises. They include perforce within it counties that
explode the premises of Negro majority, of contiguity and of &#8220;well
marked area&#8221;. No two maps drawn of the &#8220;future&#8221; Negro State tally. The
most appalling and ambitious ones include practically the entire South.
The least pretentious would include the cities of Richmond, Memphis,
Vicksburg, New Orleans and Savannah, which with the exception of
Savannah are predominantly white.</p>

<p>By focussing our attention on the &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; we cannot understand
the significance of the decisive economic and social shifts in the
South in general and among the Negroes in particular. By thinking in
terms of the &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; we can only think of the Negro problem in
terms of conditions that prevailed in the middle of the 19th century.
The basic factors in the Negro problem are not geographic divisions, or
state boundaries, or county lines. The basic factors are economic. The
so-called &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; was and still remains predominantly rural and
agricultural. In the meantime, the economic development has been
surging over the old state and new county lines. Under the impact of
economic forces the mass of the Negro population in and outside of the
six states has been rapidly shifting from rural to urban, from
agriculture to industry. This shift, which has been going on at an ever
increasing rate, must continue to take place in accordance with the
internal logic of American capitalist development. This process, which
has already vitally affected the &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; itself, although it has
not yet disintegrated it, must proceed at an ever increasing tempo.
The. agricultural aspect of the Negro problem, particularly in this
phase of it, provides the subject for an independent analysis. Suffice
it to say that the entire agricultural base of the South as a whole is
being disintegrated not only by the permanent crisis of American
agriculture, and the industrialization of the South, but also by the
mechanization of cotton farming. All these factors bear most directly
and immediately upon the Negro farmer who is being driven from the land
into urban centers and into the ranks either of the proletariat or the
unemployed. In the period immediately before us we shall witness
accelerated changes in the &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; proper, precisely along the
lines indicated by what has already happened elsewhere in the South.
The Negro farmer is being driven from the land.</p>

<p>This movement has already penetrated deeply into the heart of the
&#8220;Black Belt&#8221; itself. We
have already pointed out its stationary or declining population and
also the fact that more than two-thirds of the Negro farms in the South
and almost three-fourths of the tenant farmers are in the &#8220;Black Belt&#8221;
area. What holds true of the entire South bears most directly upon the
Negro farmers in these six states. In the entire South, in 1920, there
were about 980,000 Negro farmers of whom 714,000 or about three-fourths
were tenants; in 1930 the Negro farmers dropped to 880,000 of whom
699,000 were tenants or more than three-fourths. At the same time, only
46.6% of the white farmers in the South were tenants. The pressure to
which the agricultural Negro is being subjected is brought out still
more clearly by comparing the trend among Negro farmers with that among
white southern farmers. Between 1920 and 1930 the number of white
farmers dropped also, but only 1.6% as compared with more than 7% for
the Negroes. While the Negro tenants decreased absolutely, the number
of white tenant farmers increased. At the same time the number of white
share croppers almost approached that of the Negro croppers: white,
383,381; Negro, 392,897. The white farmer is being pauperized at a
different rate from the Negro. But the pauperization of the white
farmer accelerates the rate at which the Negro is being driven from the
land. And in point of fact this has already crystallized itself
definitely: the economic base of the Negro has already shifted from
agriculture to industry. The crux of the Negro problem is in modern
industry and
not in the old agricultural South.</p>
<p>The movement of the Negroes to the North has been nothing but an
integral part of the urbanization of the Negro. The movement northward
began at the same time as the urban shift in the South. The growth of
Negro population in the North from 9.4% in 1890 to 20.2% in 1930 is
only an integral part of the shift to cities and towns of the Negro
population as a whole from 19.4% of the total in 1890 to 43.7% in 1930.
The sweep of this shift is apparent at a glance, if we examine some
figures.</p>
<p>In 1930 there were more <em>adult</em> Negroes in towns and cities
than remained on land. According to the last census, adult urban
Negroes &#8211; in the entire U. S. between 20 and 44 years of age &#8211; numbered
2,820,000; those who remained on the land numbered 2,197,000. <a
id="f1" href="#n1" name="f1" target="_blank" >[1]</a></p>

<p>Over 3,800,000 or almost two-thirds of those gainfully employed were
engaged in occupations other than agriculture in which there had
remained only 36.1%, a drop of almost a million from the number in 1910
when 84.6% of those gainfully employed were engaged in agriculture.</p>
<p>Equally illustrative of the intensity of the shift is the fact that
the Negro population in 79 major cities increased over 60% in a single
decade, 1920-1930, leaping from 1,920,000 in 1920 to 3,150,000 in 1930.
Even in 1920, at the inception of &#8220;the &#8220;Black Belt&#8221; ballyhoo, this
trend away from the land was clearly indicated, for already at that
time only two-fifths of those gainfully employed were engaged in
agriculture.</p>
<p>The consequences of this urbanization have been far-reaching. The
relation of the Negro to industry has radically altered. Until as late
as 1914, the Negro served as a reserve to draw on in times of labor
shortage or strikes. By 1930 the Negro had become an integral part of
the labor force in practically every important industry.</p>
<p>In the movement away from the land, two peak waves are to be
observed, one in 1916-1919, the other in 1921-24; but they were only a
part of the continuous trend and not a sudden isolated exodus. Once
again we stress that underlying the ebbs and flows of this movement are
not geographic or &#8220;sentimental&#8221; causes but profound economic forces.
The labor agencies of large industries had a great deal more to do with
it than the activities of the Klu Kluxers in the South.</p>
<p>The Negroes&#8217; function as a labor reserve led to their utilization as
strikebreakers. But from this role of a labor reserve they have become
transformed into integral parts of the industrial structure. Negroes
compose 7.6% of the total labor force in the mining industry; 10.3% in
transport; 7.2% in manufacturing and machine industry. Although they
are only 9.7% of the US population, they composed in 1930, 28% of the
unskilled workers in large meat packing concerns; 16.2% of the
unskilled in the steel industry; and 22.7% of the laborers in building
trades. Instances are not lacking of strikes in which the
proletarianized Negro served as the backbone while the bosses depended
upon Negro strikebreakers primarily recruited from rural districts. The
Negro has definitely become an integral part of the proletariat,
preponderantly unskilled and most intensely exploited.</p>

<p>The Negro problem is and will be to an ever increasing degree a
working class problem; and the crucial criterion is the economic and
not the geographic distribution of the Negro population. By themselves
statistics are meaningless such as that in 1930 almost four-fifths of
the Negro population still lived in the socalled South, or that the
bulk of the Negro population is spread over 24 states and that almost
20% lives in eight northern states (Pa., N.Y., N.J., Ohio, Ill., Mich.,
Missouri, and Indiana), or any other assortment of vital statistics.
What is decisive is the economic content of the figures. And in respect
to the Negro this content is industrial. This does not mean that we
disregard entirely, or intend to minimize the importance of the Negro
farmer. The Negro agrarian problem is an acute and an important one.
However, the American Negro is not predominantly agricultural. He is a
proletarian.</p>
<p>From the revolutionary standpoint the Negro problem is primarily the
problem of gaining over to the revolutionary platform the overwhelming
majority of the Negro workers. The rural Negro can be gained as an ally
only in the same manner, basically, as the rural white, and that is by
being mobilized under the leadership of the proletariat.</p>
<p>From the very beginning the misleaders of the American working class
as a whole and Negroes in particular have tried to drum into the heads
of Negro and white that working class unity could not be achieved
directly. Booker T. Washington did what he could to discourage Negroes
from putting their trust in working class unity. And on the other hand,
the reactionary trade union bureaucracy has drawn racial lines as
rigidly as any Ku Kluxer. The unmasking of the class struggle will
greatly facilitate the political development of American workers, Negro
and white. But we will fail to unite them unless our fundamental
approach to the Negro is the same as to any other worker, taking of
course into consideration that they represent at present the most
backward section of the backward working class, not because they were
colored but because they stem directly from the most backward rural
sections.</p>
<p>The elemental urge to class solidarity has manifested itself time
and again. But these were and remained only episodic beginnings, in the
absence of a genuine revolutionary party. Decades ago, in 1886, the old
Knights of Labor had over 60,000 Negroes organized in its ranks. The
IWW even in the darkest South was able to organize into a single
organization Negroes and whites and lead them to successful strikes
particularly in the lumber industry. In West Virginia, where the
reactionary United Mine Workers of America tried to gain a foothold,
two counties were more than half organized and most of the miners were
Negroes; they were the backbone of the strike. But numerous as these
instances are, they have remained episodic, and the base must be
practically laid anew. One thing is certain: there are no &#8220;national&#8221;
shortcuts to organizing the Negro workers. The basic slogan is that of <em>class
solidarity</em>, and not at all the slogan of &#8220;self-determination&#8221;.</p>
<p>Booker T. Washington preached to the Negroes against class
solidarity and tried to imbue them with self-degradation. He said, &#8220;the
wisest of my race understand that the agitation of questions of social
equality is the extremest folly ...&#8221; He advocated an &#8220;alliance&#8221; with
the wealthy whites against the &#8220;white trash&#8221;, i.e., against the white
workers who are the &#8220;oppressors and scoundrels, who hold Negroes in
contempt and lynch them&#8221;. The Negroes have been taught by the
bourgeoisie to distrust and hate the white workers and vice versa. We
must imbue the Negro with class solidarity. We must say,</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The wisest of the Negro race understand that the
agitation of the question of class solidarity is the only way out for
his race! Class conscious Negro and white workers must teach the Negro
masses and the white that they have only one enemy &#8211; their real
lynchers and oppressors &#8211; the capitalists.&#8221;</p>
