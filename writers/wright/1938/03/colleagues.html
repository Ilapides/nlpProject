<p>While abroad was arrested by Austrian police as a &#8220;spy,&#8221; but was set free on intervention of Austrian Socialists. Says the <strong>Small Encyclopedia</strong>: &#8220;this charge was too absurd.&#8221; Deported to Switzerland. In 1915 went to Sweden, where the Swedish police arrested him as an &#8220;agent of Lenin&#8221; for his anti-militarist propaganda, charging him with alleged preparations to &#8220;blow up bridges&#8217;&#8217; and &#8220;throw bombs.&#8221; Deported from Sweden.
