<p class="fst"><strong>Trotskyism: Counter-revolution in Disguise</strong><br>
By M.J. Olgin<br>
<em>160 pp. New York. Workers Library Publishers. 15c</em></p>
<p class="fst">To page for the physical destruction of Trotsky and the
&#8220;Trotskyists&#8221; &#8211; this obstacle, and danger to the power, policies, and
privileges of the venal bureaucracy &#8211; the falsifiers of history, now
turned social-patriots, are preparing to go one crime further: to frame
up Trotsky and his co-thinkers as assassins, as terrorists whose aim is
to murder Stalin. The GPU was involved in the assassination of Kirov
(see <strong>NY Times</strong>, Jan. 24, 1935). But this attempt to
link Trotsky with the terrorists through a provocateur failed. Is there
another, a bigger and better frame-up in preparation? There is.<br>

&nbsp;</p>
<h4>I</h4>
<p class="fst">S.V. Kossior, reporting to the Kiev party membership, on
June 13, 1938 stated:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;... it is absolutely clear to all of us that both
Zinoviev and Kamenev were not only the inspirers of those who shot at
comrade Kirov. They were the direct organizers of this vile
assassination of comrade Kirov. They acted in complete harmony with the
counter-revolutionist Trotsky. Recently, in his statements abroad
relating to the assassination of comrade Kirov, <em>Trotsky openly
revealed his terrorist position, openly called for terror against the
Bolsheviks, against the leaders of our party</em>. All distinction
between him and the White Guards has long since disappeared.&#8221; (<strong>Pravda</strong>,
June 22, 1935.)</p>
<p class="fst">And here is Olgin, in America:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;He [Trotsky] has a dream now. To see ... the leaders
of Bolshevism assassinated.&#8221; (p.22.)</p>

<p class="fst">The seventh, main, and <em>final</em> feature of
&#8220;Trotskyism&#8221; is: &#8220;... support of intervention and killing of Soviet
leaders.&#8221; (p.49.)</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;From this to the decision of some inflamed follower
to kill the leaders of the revolution &#8211; is only one step.&#8221; (p.137.)</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;... The extreme logical followers of Trotsky resort
to the revolver.&#8221; (p.65.)</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Do the Trotskyists knowingly create a psychological
atmosphere that would fire some madman to attempt the murder of
Stalin?&#8221; (p.149.)</p>
<p class="fst">There is no mistaking the sort of atmosphere Olgin is
trying to manufacture in his <strong>Trotskyism</strong>, the 160-page
book by him issued in carloads, at a ridiculously low price. Unlike
Kossior, Olgin can only insinuate about the &#8220;connection&#8221; of the
Trotskyists in the assassination of Kirov:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Did the Trotskyists of America maintain a direct
connection with the &#8216;Leningrad Center&#8217; out of which came the
assassination of Kirov, or were they only appraised [<em>sic!</em>] of
its existence?&#8221; (p.136.)</p>

<p class="fst">But, like Kossior, he, too, states openly what his job
is:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Today one exposes Trotsky as a counter-revolutionary
renegade who inspires [in Moscow, they say: <em>organises</em> &#8211; <em>J.G.W.</em>]
the murder of revolutionary leaders.&#8221; (p.144.)</p>
<p class="fst">Here we have the literary-provocateur at work.</p>
<p>And Olgin&#8217;s qualifications? Suffice to mention here that Oigin is no
novice at &#8220;exposure&#8221;, nor at getting the proper emotions across the
footlights, and of presenting a &#8220;character&#8221; in his proper relation to
the &#8220;plot&#8221;. He is the author of at least one produced play, and even a
hack&#8217;s knowledge of stage-effects comes in handily in plying the art of
Stalinist provocation.</p>

<p>Some forty years of Trotsky&#8217;s life have been spent under the banner
of revolutionary Marxism. It is an impossible feat to palm off a
Marxist for the advocate of individualistic terrorism. This
contradiction must be resolved. Olgin must therefore &#8220;build up&#8221; a
suitable character, for he is not in Alice&#8217;s Wonderland where one may
&#8220;skip forty years&#8221;. Hence arises the need for a &#8220;brief&#8221; 160 pages.</p>
<p>Olgin has to explain away how Trotsky became a revolutionary figure.
Sheer coincidence. A petty bourgeois, with talents as a talker and
scribe, collided with the revolution, and was swept along.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;When the revolutionary labor movement in Russia was
young, a man with a sharp pen and an oratorial talent such as Trotsky
could easily become noted.&#8221; (p.9).</p>

<p class="fst">The Russian revolution and all the Olgins were then
young and inexperienced. Ah, credulous youth! But the Russian
revolution grew a little older. How to explain away experienced age?
Olgin crawls out of his skin, producing quotations from old
controversies, distorting history, and undertaking psychologic
excursions into the petty bourgeoisie to prove that Lenin never
&#8220;considered Trotsky a Bolshevik&#8221;; that Trotsky was an &#8220;alien body
within the organism of the Bolshevik party, even when he was a member
of its Political Bureau&#8221; (p.15); that Trotsky only assumed the name
&#8220;Bolshevik&#8221;, but remained a petty bourgeois, (once a petty bourgeois
always a petty bourgeois) and therefore, logically, and artistically, a
consistent character for a White Guard assassin.</p>
<p>In 1907 Lenin said,</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;A few words about Trotsky. There is no need here for
me to dwell on our differences with him. Suffice to mention that
Trotsky in his booklet, <strong>In Defense of the Party</strong> has
publicly expressed his agreement with Kautsky, who wrote about the
economic community of interests between the proletariat and the
peasantry in the present revolution in Russia ... <em>These facts
suffice so far as I am concerned to recognise the closeness of Trotsky
to our views</em>.&#8221; (<strong>Minutes of the London Congress of the SDLPR</strong>,
Paris 1909, p.329. Our italics.)</p>

<p class="fst">On November 14, 1917, at the session of the Petersburg
Committee of the SDLPR, Lenin said,</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I cannot even speak about this seriously [agreement
with the Mensheviks and the SR&#8217;s]. Trotsky has long ago said that unity
is impossible. Trotsky has understood this, and since then there hasn&#8217;t
been a better Bolshevik than he.&#8221; (<strong>Bulletin
of the Russian Opposition</strong>, No.7, 1929, pp.33f.)</p>
<p class="fst">But what are photostats or Lenin ? Or any number of
facts and documents to the contrary? &#8220;Lenin did not consider Trotsky a
Bolshevik&#8221; &#8211; (signed) Olgin (p.10).</p>
<p>And the provocateur must next rewrite the history of the October
revolution to fit his &#8220;character&#8221;. Who led the October insurrection?

&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t he [Trotsky] the leader of the revolution in 1917?&#8221;</p>
<p>In Vol.XIV of Lenin&#8217;s works, published in 1921, the following note
is to be found on page 482:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Following the July days he [Trotsky] was arrested by
the Kerensky government, and indicted for &#8216;leading the insurrection&#8217;.
After the majority of the Petersburg Soviet passed into the hands of
the Bolsheviks, Trotsky was elected its president and in <em>that
position organized and led the insurrection of October 25</em>.&#8221; (Our
italics.)</p>
<p class="fst">On November 6, 1918, Stalin himself admitted as much:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;All the work of practical organization of the
insurrection was conducted under the immediate leadership of the
president of the Petrograd Soviet, comrade Trotsky. (<strong>Pravda</strong>,
No.214. <em>The Role of the Most Eminent Leaders of the Party</em>.)</p>

<p class="fst">So what? &#8220;He who knows the ways of the Bolshevik party
will easily understand why Trotsky was not among the leaders appointed
by the Central Committee to direct the uprising&#8221; &#8211; (signed) Olgin
(p.12).</p>
<p>Next, the civil war. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t he at the head of the Red Army between
1918 and 1921?&#8221;</p>
<p>Twist and twirl as he will, the Stalinist forger has to explain
away, not a single episode this time, but the entire crucial period of
the civil war. Observe, how the Stalinist squirms:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Time passed. Trotsky worked with the Bolsheviks ...
But he was a stranger in the Bolshevik party. The civil war came and
[!] Trotsky was given a high post. [Evidently, another coincidence &#8211; <em>J.G.W.</em>]
<em>He was, so to speak, propagandist-in-chief of the Red Army</em>.&#8221;

(p.13. Our italics.)</p>
<p class="fst">And Olgin describes how Trotsky &#8220;played General&#8221; during
the civil war:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Trotsky travelled up and down the front ... went
into the trenches to talk to the Red Army men; he made great public
orations &#8211; but he never led the civil war.&#8221; (p.13.)</p>
<p class="fst">It was just a delusion on Trotsky&#8217;s part. Olgin, the
military expert, has to admit that Trotsky was the &#8220;Military
Commissar&#8221;, just as he has had to admit Trotsky&#8217;s revolutionary career.
The facts are too well known. So they must be explained away. And we
hear again the now familiar melody. Just a coincidence! The civil war
was young, incredulously inexperienced, and an adult man with a sharp
pen &#8211; &#8220;issuing crisp orders that can be quoted as examples of military
style&#8221; (p.13) &#8211; and an oratorical talent such as Trotsky&#8217;s, could
easily become &#8211; not &#8220;noted&#8221; this time but &#8211; the Commissar of War. Just
as Trotsky played at being a revolutionist in 1905, so he was now
deluded</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;into believing that he was the whole moving spirit
of that tremendous historic combat ... The actual facts are just the
reverse. The facts are that <em>Stalin</em> and <em>Voroshilov</em>
[what? no Frunze?] were the great fighters on the various battle fronts
&#8211; leaders with clear revolutionary vision and strategists of the first
order&#8221; (p.13).</p>
<p class="fst">Let us allow for the moment that Stalin-Voroshilov-Olgin
are correct. Let us allow that Trotsky</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;knew nothing about the organization of the army, he
had wrong ideas about revolutionary strategy ... As a matter of fact,
his ideas about the strategy of the civil war were so wrong that, had
they been carried, the enemies would have triumphed ... etc. etc.&#8221;
(p.13).</p>

<p class="fst">We want to know: why did the party tolerate such an
ignoramus, and the whole Revolutionary War Council? Why wasn&#8217;t Trotsky
removed from his post during the years of civil war? Why was neither
Stalin nor Voroshilov &#8211; both these &#8220;strategists of the first order&#8221; &#8211;
appointed as the leaders, but why were they instead removed on more
than one occasion from difficult sectors? Why did Lenin send telegram
after telegram <a id="f1" href="#n1" name="f1" target="_blank" >[1]</a> to Trotsky
insisting on his going to the most critical sectors?</p>
<p>Olgin has had to explain away too much. His forged version of the
civil war compromises the party, vilifies the CEC and Lenin. For, were
his lies and monstrous exaggerations true, it could only imply that the
CEC led by Lenin, was guilty of the gravest, and absolutely inexcusable
crime before the revolution: supporting, as they are charged, an
ignoramus and bungler as the head of the Red Army. The leader of the
victorious Red Army was removed by the Stalinists <em>after</em> the
civil war from his post.<br>

&nbsp;</p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p class="fst">Having provided his &#8220;brief&#8221; with the required White
Guard Villain, Olgin must also supply the &#8220;Red Hero&#8221;. That is to say,
he must explain away the decade of crimes, defeats, and betrayals under
the leadership of Stalin.</p>
<p>The &#8220;world-charlatan&#8221;, the petty bourgeois adventurer in the
revolutionary movement, turned into a White Guard, finds (in Olgin&#8217;s
fertile imagination) his nemesis in Stalin, the Heroic, &#8220;the world
leader whose <em>every</em> advice to <em>every</em> Party of the
Comintern on <em>every problem</em> is [was and will be &#8211; <em>J.G.W.</em>,

<em>J.C.</em>] correct, clear, balanced, and points the way to new,
more decisive class battles&#8221; (p.149).</p>
<p>This hero in the Kremlin, who like Jehova has a promised land to his
credit &#8211; the Land of Socialism in One Country &#8211; is likewise responsible
for the ripe fruits of the &#8220;bloc of four classes in China&#8221;, the
Anglo-Russian Committee, the theory of social-Fascism, the victory of
Hitler in Germany, etc. etc. ... down to the ripest fruit of all, the
Franco-Soviet pact. And the latter-day Moses of this latter-day Jehovah
has a lot more explaining to do than was necessary in the Bible to
establish Jehovah&#8217;s infallibility.</p>
<p>Naturally enough, Moissaye J. Olgin prefers to do most of his
explaining in China, which is however not quite so far removed as
Heaven. The glamor and &#8220;mystery&#8221; of the Orient, as we know, covers much
filth and squalor, but not even China will screen a Stalin.</p>

<p>In China, if you please, there are Soviets &#8220;Led by the CP of China,
which early in 1935 counted over 400,000 members&#8221; (p.86); there is the
Red Army, &#8220;the wonder of the world ... in the neighborhood of one
million men&#8221; (p.86); and &#8220;the Red Flag with the hammer and sickle is
waving over a territory embracing a population of some ninety million &#8211;
about one-fifth of the total population of China&#8221; (p.86). Then, why
didn&#8217;t the one-sixth of the world which is communist at least recognize
the Chinese Soviets, in one-fifth of China? Why not a Soviet
China-Soviet Union pact against the threat of Fascism and war? Why
doesn&#8217;t Litvinov demand at least that this great ally be accepted into
the League of Nations?</p>
<p>Because Olgin is covering up the betrayal of the Chinese revolution
in 1925-1927, by the &#8220;Chinese Soviets&#8221;, peasant bands and peasant
armies, the remaining echoes and repercussions of the 1925-1927
revolution who are still able to maintain themselves due to the
peculiar conditions in China, with its vast vestiges of feudal economy,
the resulting economic isolation of provinces in the interior, the
absence of inter-province railroads and other means of communication,
etc.</p>

<p>Trotsky, Olgin yowls, &#8220;assumed a Menshevik position as regards the
very nature of the Chinese revolution&#8221;. The essence of Menshevism is
class collaboration, support of the &#8220;liberal bourgeoisie&#8221;. The
Mensheviks in Russia not only frowned upon the peasant seizure of land,
but they supported punitive expeditions against the insurgent peasants.
They discouraged as provocation and adventurism strikes of workers
during the revolution because all this would break the united front
with the bourgeoisie. They rejected the theory and practise of the
proletariat wielding the hegemony in the revolution: that democratic
tasks would and could be only the results of the <em>proletarian</em>
revolution; that only the proletarian dictatorship could and would lead
to the emancipation of the peasantry and the oppressed peoples.</p>
<p>What was the Stalinist policy in China? Stalin subordinated the CP
to the Kuo Min Tang in the name of the &#8220;bloc of four classes&#8221; (the
bourgeoisie, the urban petty bourgeoisie, the peasantry, and the
proletariat). After Chiang Kai-Shek&#8217;s betrayal, the CP was subordinated
to the &#8220;bloc of three classes&#8221; &#8211; only three &#8220;faithful allies remained&#8221;.
So the communists entered the Wuhan government and assumed personal and
direct responsibility for the punitive expeditions against the
insurgent peasantry!</p>

<p>There is no hiding the betrayal. It seeps out even in Olgin&#8217;s own
version. According to him, Chiang Kai-Shek &#8220;betrayed&#8221; in March 1927.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;When the imperialists began to bombard Nanking in
March 1927, Chiang Kai-Shek joined hands with them against the
revolution.&#8221; (p.103.)</p>
<p class="fst">But Olgin does not utter a peep about what the communist
party did after this betrayal was as obvious as is Olgin&#8217;s venality.
One month later, an April 13, 1927, the workers in Shanghai, under the
Stalinist leadership were compelled to hand over the city to &#8220;their
revolutionary&#8221; General, Chiang Kai-Shek, to be drowned in blood by
&#8220;their leader&#8221;.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the first open act of betrayal on the part of
Chiang was not in March 1927, <em>but one year prior to it</em>, on
March 20, 1926, the occasion of his first overturn in Canton. For
years, this fact was kept from the international working class, and
Olgin remains true to tradition. There is no other way to justify
adherence to the Kuo Min Tang, the party of the butcher Chiang. How
else but by fraud can he justify Stalin&#8217;s &#8220;clear, correct and balanced
slogan&#8221;: &#8220;We shall never drop the banner of the Kuo Min Tang.&#8221; And they
didn&#8217;t! Chiang cut the throats of Chinese workers, drowned the
revolution in blood, and soaked the banner of Kuo Min Tang into a &#8220;red&#8221;
banner.</p>
<p>What did the Stalinists order the Chinese CP to do after March 20,
1926? What was the reaction of the masses? We give the floor to the
co-reporter on the Chinese question at the Sixth Congress of the
Comintern in 1928. The speaker is Strakhov:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Even after March 20, we did our utmost to get along
with the March 20 regime so as to keep the united front with the
bourgeoisie, with Chiang Kai-Shek, with the nationalists. As far as the
masses were concerned they could not be reconciled to the March 20
regime.&#8221; (<strong>Inprecorr</strong>, October 4, 1928.)</p>

<p class="fst">The Stalinists, like the Mensheviks, refused to break
the united front with the bourgeoisie, and they were &#8220;taken by
surprise&#8221; in March 1927.</p>
<p>After they finally did &#8220;break&#8221; with Chiang Kai-Shek, the Stalinists
sought to maintain at all costs their &#8220;faithful&#8221; alliance with the
petty bourgeoisie. Again, Strakhov, the co-reporter on the Chinese
revolution:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Although we were then already fighting against
Chiang Kai-Shek and the national bourgeoisie, we had not yet realized
the inevitability of a disruption of the united front with the petty
bourgeoisie for the sake of which we obstructed the development of the
mass struggle. (<strong>Ibid.</strong>, p.1251.)</p>

<p class="fst">In the Wuhan bloc, in its alliance with petty bourgeois
generals and politicians, Stalinism discouraged peasant rebellions and
seizures of land. The Stalinist ministers in the coalition Wuhan
government violently suppressed peasant uprisings, &#8220;obstructing the
development of the mass struggle&#8221; as part of their Menshevist delusions.</p>
<p>Nauseating as Olgin&#8217;s picture of &#8220;Soviet China&#8221; is, he surpasses
himself in painting the Canton Soviet of December 1927. &#8220;The first
Soviet was organized in Canton <em>after</em> the armed rising of
December 11, 1927.&#8221; (p.106. Our italics). Soviets organized after the
rising! But doesn&#8217;t the Soviet, the highest organ of the united front,
also function as the <em>organ of insurrection</em>? Olgin denies the

&#8220;Trotskyist slander&#8221; that the Soviet was &#8220;created in a hurry&#8221; (Trotsky).</p>
<p>But Strakhov himself admitted that &#8220;there were very few people at
the mass meeting in Canton&#8221;. This meeting elected the delegates to the
Soviet. The revolutionary wave had already waned. To Trotsky&#8217;s charge
that the Canton uprising was an &#8220;adventuristic putsch&#8221;, Olgin replies
by screaming that it &#8220;was one of the most heroic uprisings of the
workers and peasants ... Over 7,000 fighters were shot in Canton alone
after the crushing of the uprising.&#8221; (p.107.)</p>

<p>The blood of heroic workers and peasants has served more than once
before as a cover for crime and treachery.</p>
<p>After one-sixth of the book devoted to the falsification of Chinese
history &#8211; <em>two pages</em> on the &#8220;third period&#8221;!</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We must confess, we never found in Trotskyite
writings anything resembling an explanation of why they disagreed with
the &#8216;third period&#8217; analysis. They just scoffed.&#8221; (p.112.)</p>

<p class="fst">France, imperialist France, some seven years ago was
placed <em>first</em> on the order of revolution. Then, France was in
a pre-revolutionary situation; in 1935 &#8211; there is no &#8220;revolutionary&#8221;
situation in France, the military ally of Stalinism.</p>
<p>But the &#8220;third period&#8221; of the mistakes of the Stalintern was only
meant as a cover for the defeat in China and the betrayal in the
Anglo-Russian Committee. So it is best passed over in silence or with a
squeal &#8211; by all the Olgins.</p>

<p>And next &#8211; 12 pages on Germany and ... the &#8220;question of
social-Fascism&#8221;. After their &#8220;united fronts&#8221; with the Chiangs and the
Purcells, the Stalinists decided to play safe &#8211; no more united fronts
with anybody! Only the united front from BELOW!</p>
<p>In talking about Germany, Olgin prefers to speak &#8211; about Austria &#8211;
for the purposes of reducing the theory of &#8220;social-Fascism&#8221; and its
fatal consequences into a mere verbalism.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In the very same way as Lenin, after the betrayal of
the proletariat by social democracy at the beginning of the war called
the social democratic leaders <em>social patriots</em> and <em>social
chauvinists</em>, so the Communist International called its leaders <em>social-Fascists</em>
&#8211; in the sense of paving the way for Fascism.&#8221; (P. 114.)</p>
<p class="fst">Lenin did it. <a id="f2" href="#n2" name="f2" target="_blank" >[2]</a>
Stalin did it. That is all.</p>

<p>And with this piece of sophistry and hypocrisy Olgin thinks to dupe
workers, who have not experienced themselves the actual essence of the
theory of social Fascism &#8211; not in the sense of &#8220;paving the way for
Fascism&#8221;, but as the very instrument of fascism.</p>
<p>In 1929 Pieck, one of the leaders of the CP of Germany, declared
that the social democracy &#8220;is growing more and more ripe to play the
chief part should a Fascist form of government be established&#8221; (<strong>Labour
Monthly</strong>, June 1929).</p>
<p>At the Tenth Plenum of the ECCI, Bela Kun (the present head of the
CI) stated:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;... the evolution of the social democracy towards
social-Fascism has not yet sufficiently advanced to enable us to
determine whether social-Fascism constitutes a special and final form
of Fascization in a number of countries, or if it constitutes a step
towards the complete development of Fascism also in countries like
Germany, Poland, Rumania, etc., which are on the road towards
Fascization.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">That was the only thing in question! Whether
social-Fascism is a final form of Fascism or a step towards complete
Fascism! And Bela Kun proceeds to attack the Right wingers:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The Italian development is no argument against the
possibility for social democracy to <em>evolve into pure Fascism</em>
... If there is a sham fight between the social democracy and these
open Fascist organizations it is by no means a fight between two
principles but rather a clash between <em>two methods of Fascization</em>
... I believe, that in the present stage of the development of
social-Fascism we have to be prepared rather <em>for armed clashes
with Fascism and its social-Fascist organisations</em>, more than ever
before ... we should do our utmost to combat the social democracy and
in the first place, the Left wing of the social democracy&#8221;. (<strong>Inprecorr</strong>,
August 21, 1929, pp.872<em>f</em>.) Comment is unnecessary.</p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky and the Bolshevik-Leninists repeated time and
again that the social democracy &#8220;paved the way for Fascism&#8221; and they
attacked the theory that the social democracy is compatible with a
Fascist government, or that in advanced countries the social-Fascist
dictatorship would be the final form of Fascism. Trotsky insisted that
the social democracy would be crushed by Fascism. Now Olgin changes the
story. The Stalinists labelled Trotsky a &#8220;counter-revolutionist&#8221; for
proposing a united front of struggle against Fascism. Now, Olgin,
quotes extensively <em>from Austria</em> to prove that the Stalinists
did want a united front, but that it was impossible to make it. Why?
Because &#8220;<em>prior to the advent of Hitler the social democracy did not
believe this</em> [i.e., that Fascism would crush it. &#8211; <em>J.G.W.</em>]&#8221;

(p.119). Proof: Otto Bauer in Austria.</p>
<p>Did the Stalinists understand this before the events smashed the
skulls of the German workers? The theory of social-Fascism is the
answer! The united front from below is the answer! Even today the
Comintern still holds that the beaten and crushed German social
democracy remains &#8220;the main support&#8221; of Fascism.</p>
<p>Olgin himself has to admit that between 1929-1932, the CP did not
propose the united front to the SP &#8211; it did engage in the Red
Referendum. He tries to cover it up by underscoring that</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;in 1929-1932 it repeatedly proposed <em>joint
action against</em> Fascism? The real position of the Stalinists was,
however, clearly enough stated at that time: &#8216;There is and can be no
united front with any group of social democratic leaders. The
anti-Fascist united front can and will be brought about to the
exclusion and against the groups of social democratic leaders&#8217; &#8211; (Willi
M&uuml;nzenberg, <strong>Rote[r] Aufbau</strong>, December 11, 1931.)&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">From bureaucratic ultimatism and exaggeration of their
strength prior to Hitler&#8217;s seizure of power, to shabby sophistry in
apology for the betrayal after the victory of Fascism ... down to
social patriotism today &#8211; such is the itinerary of all the Staininists,
all the Olgins.</p>
<p>Where are the Stalinists leading the Soviet Union? In his &#8220;exposure&#8221;
of Trotskyism, Olgin tries to hide behind the achievements of the
workers in the Soviet Union, and argues, if you please, that Trotsky
denies &#8220;the possibility of a victorious proletarian revolution in one
country&#8221; (p.28). Trotsky, who with Lenin lead the October revolution is
&#8220;proved&#8221; to have lead it by mistake; he never believed in it anyway.</p>
<p>But today one no longer argues the subtleties of the theory of
socialism in one country, or explains the permanent revolution. The
Stalinists have promised the workers socialism in the Soviet Union, if
only they shut-up, endure and toil &#8211; for 10 years.</p>

<p>Long, long ago, the Stalinists proclaimed their &#8220;entry into the
period of Socialism&#8221; (see, for example, <strong>Inprecorr</strong>,
March 21, 1931). More, in October 1932, Manuilsky, the then leader of
the CI told the working class of the world:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Do not forget that we shall enter classless society
only with the completion of the second Five-Year Plan.&#8221; (<strong>Report
to the Twelfth Plenum of the ECCI</strong>)</p>
<p class="fst">The workers in the Soviet Union have certainly not
forgotten. Today, on the eve of the completion of the second Five-Year
Plan, the Stalinists have to prepare to account for the frightful
discrepancy between realty and their theory. They are preparing to
settle the accounts by more repression, and more pogroms, and greater
and better betrayals.</p>
<p>Today, the question is put squarely: Are we the willing slaves of
&#8220;our own&#8221; imperialism or the implacable foes of imperialism and its
ally Stalinism? Upon the answer to this question depends the fate of
the workers&#8217; state in the Soviet Union and the fate of the world
revolution. Their &#8220;clear and balanced&#8221; social patriotic betrayal will
not be masked by the literary and actual pogroms in preparation by
Stalin, and all his Olgins.</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n1" href="#f1" name="n1" target="_blank" >1.</a> &#8220;August 22,
1918, Svyajsk. To Trotsky. Betrayal on the Saratov front, although
discovered in time, has resulted in vacillation &#8211; extremely dangerous.
We consider absolutely necessary your immediately departure for that
sector, for your appearance
at the front reacts upon the soldiers and the entire army ... <em>Lenin,
Sverdlov</em>&#8221;</p>
<p class="note">&#8220;April 10, 1919. To Trotsky. Nijny Novgorod. In view of
the extremely critical situation at the Eastern front, I think it best
for you to remain there. <em>Lenin</em>&#8221;</p>
<p class="note">&#8220;May 7, 1919. Shikhrana. To Trotsky. I have just asked
the whole Political Bureau of the C.E.C. and in agreement with them I
am decisively for your immediate and quickest possible departure for
Kharkovfi where it is necessary to put an end to disorganization and
immediately give aid to the Donetz Basin. <em>Lenin</em>&#8221;</p>

<p class="note">&#8220;May 21, 1919 ... I personally would insist on your
going once again to Bogachur and completely crush the insurrection,
otherwise there is no hope of victory. <em>Lenin</em>&#8221;</p>
<p class="note">(One day later) &#8220;May 22, 1919. ... I insist again on
your unfailingly going a second time to Bogachur and putting an end to
the matter, because Sofkolnikov obviously cannot handle the situation. <em>Lenin</em>&#8221;</p>
<p class="note">And here is Trotsky&#8217;s answer.</p>
<p class="note">&#8220;Kharkov-Lugansk <em>(en route)</em> Moscow. To
Sklansky for Lenin. Leaving for Bogachur, where will try to put an end
to the matter. <em>Trotsky</em>. May 22, 1919.&#8221;</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n2" href="#f2" name="n2" target="_blank" >2.</a> And many
Stalinist dupes will fall for this sophistry! The social democrats
during the war actively supported their capitalist fatherland. Their
social basis, the labor aristocracy organized into trade unions, was
not incompatible with imperialist war. On the contrary, it was
precisely this social basis, integrated with the bourgeois state and
imperialism, which Lenin cited as the historical reason for the
conversion of social democracy into social chauvinism. Fascism,
however, exterminates the social democracy.</p>
