<h1>Gangway fo&#8217; de Lawd</h1>

<h3>(May 1935)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="information">From <strong>New International</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/issue.htm#ni35_05" target="new">Vol.2 No.3</A>, May 1935, pp.109-110.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%">
<p class="fst">AT THE Seventh Congress of the Soviets, a writer, A.
Avdeyenko, delivered an extraordinary speech entitled <em>Why I
Applauded Stalin</em>. It was one of the highlights of the Congress. So
profound an impression did Avdeyenko&#8217;s speech produce that Molotov
himself paused in his summary to take note of it. Said Molotov,</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I do not intend to dwell upon the speeches of
individual comrades ... I shall refer only to speech of writer
Avdeyenko who ... brilliantly underscored the great significance of our
struggle for socialism, as well as the devotion to Soviet power, and
the love for our party and [!] for comrade Stalin which permeates the
toilers in their millioned masses.&#8221; <em>(Applause)</em></p>
<p class="fst">The issue of <strong>Pravda</strong> (February 1, 1935)
that carries Molotov&#8217;s summary, also carries Avdeyenko&#8217;s photograph and
his remarkable speech. Exigencies of space and time forbid us to
reprint more than the most exalted passages.</p>

<p>Immediately upon taking the platform, Avdeyenko said:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Centuries shall elapse and the communist generations
of the future will deem us the happiest of all mortals that have
inhabited this planet throughout the ages, because it is we who have
seen Stalin the leader-genius, Stalin the sage, the smiling, the
kindly, the supremely simple ...</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;When I met Stalin, even at a distance, I throbbed
with his forcefulness, his magnetism and his greatness. I wanted to
sing, to shriek, to howl from happiness and exaltation.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">And so Avdeyenko sang, shrieked and howled. Said
Avdeyenko in conclusion:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Our love, our devotion, our strength, our heart, our
heroism, our life &#8211; all these are thine, great Stalin! Here take them,
all this is thine, chief of the great fatherland. Dispose of thy sons,
capable of heroic feats in the air, under the earth, on the waters, and
in the stratosphere ...</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;Men of all time and of all nations shall call by
thine name all that is beautiful, strong, wise, and pretty. Thine name
is and shall remain on every factory, every machine, every bit of land,
and in the hearts of every man ...</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;When my beloved will bear me my child, the first word
I shall teach him will be &#8211; STALIN!&#8221; <em>(Frenzied applause)</em></p>

<p class="fst">The ecstasy and the feeling are unmistakable. So
genuine, so deeply felt, so unlabored.</p>
<p>In <strong>Pravda</strong> of December 9, 1934 there is
unfortunately printed a speech by the self-same A. Avdeyenko. In
December, he spoke not in Moscow but in Sverdlovsk; not at the
Congress, but at a meeting devoted to the forthcoming elections to the
Soviets. He spoke on the subject of <em>The Intellectual</em>. The
same Avdeyenko &#8211; the same passion! We reprint here passages from both
speeches.</p>

paraphrase a second-rate English poet, and a great wit:</p>

<p class="fst">N.B. A. Avdeyenko&#8217;s novel, <strong>I Love</strong>

(thanks to you, O Stalin!) is the latest Soviet novel off the press of
the International Publishers. The <strong>Daily Worker</strong>
proudly quotes a reviewer in the English <strong>Spectator</strong> who
insists that such a book &#8220;could hardly be dug out of the present-day
Western society&#8221;.</p>
<p>If Avdeyenko is half as expert at digging as he is at crawling &#8211; his
novel will be hard to beat.</p>
