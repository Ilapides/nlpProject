<p class="fst">Veblen cannot be indiscriminately lumped with the common
run of American academicians. Compared to the academic fossils of his
time he was indeed one of the few outstanding original thinkers in
America.</p>
<p>He introduced the heresy of liberalism and objectivism into those
spheres where dogma had previously ruled unchallenged. Some forty years
ago John Bates Clark and William Graham Sumner were the infallible
popes who decreed that &#8220;rugged individualism&#8221; was the immutable law of
socio-economic development; they sanctioned private profit as a natural
right; capital, they said, was the reward of abstinence, and labor was
its next and dearest of kin enjoying the same freedom of contract and
having illimitable fields for advancement provided only it could
measure up to the superior standards of ruggedness.</p>
<p>This body of dogma was crowned by Clark&#8217;s bull that &#8220;each man is
paid an amount that equals the total product he personally creates&#8221;.
Into this massive optimism Veblen introduced a very discordant &#8211; and
somewhat pessimistic &#8211; note. He riddled the logical subtleties and the
fatuous apologetics of American &#8220;classical&#8221; economy; he ran roughshod
over its methods: he rejected the economics of the past as a taxonomic
science, reasoning from the premise that social institutions must be
approached dynamically and not statically; he declared the economics of
the past untenable in the face of evolutionary science. In a number of
books, particularly <strong>The Theory of Business Enterprise</strong>,
he laid low the natural right of private property by analyzing the
social &#8220;serviceability of business&#8221; and by attempting to elucidate the
inner logic and the actual development of capitalism.</p>

<p>He was a rebel in the liberal sense. He paid for it by becoming the
black sheep of the academic world. He was dismissed from one university
after another. He sealed his excommunication by publishing his analysis
of the influence of business upon <strong>The Higher Learning in
America</strong>, which book from the standpoint of critical analysis
marks the peak of liberal social thought in America.</p>
<p>Veblen unquestionably accepted his own approach as scientific. It is
equally incontestable that he attempted to analyze economic life as a
process. His attempts, however, did not pass beyond criticism. He
thought himself that his own generalizations were in part novel &#8211; and
in so far as American thought of his day was concerned this is correct.
For this reason he is reputed by many to be a modern iconoclast. By
imputation Veblen&#8217;s views have been interpreted as an attack upon
existing institutions. However, while there is much in Veblen that runs
counter to convention, essentially his work can serve only as a basis
for liberalism because his theoretic approach is founded on
pre-conceptions and not laws. Many of his views are novel only in so
far as they are far-fetched. Many of his seemingly iconoclastic
postulates are in reality conformist.</p>
<p>Veblen&#8217;s theoretic approach derives not from Marx whom he rejected
as unscientific but from Herbert Spencer. His &#8220;scientific&#8221; approach to
society is based on Spencer&#8217;s assertion that sociology is an
evolutionary science in the Darwinian sense. It is self-evident that to
assert that sociology is an evolutionary science is a different thing
from establishing it as such. Comte also made this assertion, but
Comte&#8217;s contribution to sociology bears the same relation to science as
astrology does to astronomy. Veblen not only failed to pass beyond the
stage of mere assertion but he was more than circumspect about his
avowed manner of approach. Why should an avowed disciple of Spencer and
a Darwinian discriminate against using the term &#8220;evolution&#8221;

prominently? Yet Veblen, who originally presented his most popular
book, <strong>The Theory of the Leisure Class</strong>, as an
&#8220;economic study in the evolution of institution&#8221;, omitted the term
&#8220;evolution&#8221; in subsequent editions, and changed the subtitle to read:
&#8220;an economic study of institutions&#8221;.</p>
<p>His attempt to establish sociology as a science sums up to the
extension of Darwinism to sociology in a manner which departs factually
but not methodologically from that of Spencer.</p>
<p>Herbert Spencer sought to synthesize Darwinian biology with
sociology. He saw no profound distinction between the laws that
governed biologic evolution, and those governing social evolution. He
viewed the social organism as corresponding at all points with the
physical organism. Accordingly, Spencer decreed that the same laws
operated in the evolution of man in society as in the evolution of the
psycho-physical man in nature. In society, just as in nature, the life
of the species is a struggle for existence; in both spheres the process
of selective adaptation takes place; and just as the biologically
fittest survive in nature, so the socially best survive in society
through natural selection.</p>
<p>Veblen likewise confounded the development of the organic species
with the development of society. He wrote that &#8220;the life of man in
society, just like the life of other species, is a struggle for
existence, and therefore it is a process of selective adaptation. The
evolution of social structure has been a process of natural selection
of institutions&#8221;.</p>

<p>Veblen differs from Spencer on two points: on the general definition
of Darwinism (evolution), and upon the terms in which social
institutions must be defined. Neither of these differences is so
decisive or scientific as might appear off-hand.</p>
<p>Spencer subscribed to the concept of progress both in natural and
social evolution; to him the modern system of free contract was both
beneficent and an ideal of nature. Veblen, however, discarded the
concept of progress as non-scientific, recognizing only development
through cumulative change, only movement without trend. He defined
evolution (Darwinism) as follows: &#8220;A scheme of thought, a scheme of
blindly cumulative causation in which there is no trend, no final term,
no consummation.&#8221; Spencer, on the other hand, did recognize trend in
evolution &#8211; the trend from a &#8220;relatively indefinite incoherent
homogeneity to a relatively definite coherent heterogeneity&#8221;.</p>
<p>To estimate the significance of this point of divergence between
Veblen and Spencer, one need only recall that Veblen&#8217;s viewpoint
translated into the language of economic theory coincides with that of
the revisionist, Bernstein, who said that, &#8220;Movement is everything, the
goal nothing.&#8221; Veblen was aware that the views of the revisionists were
akin to his own. He rejected Marx as unscientific. In his opinion, the
position of Bernstein, Conrad Schmidt, Tugan-Baranovski, Labriola,
Ferri, etc., was one &#8220;tending to bring them abreast of the standpoint
of modern science, essentially Darwinist&#8221;. His own definition of the
Darwinian standpoint did not, however, prevent Veblen from referring
illogically in his writings to progress, as for example: &#8220;the progress
which has been and is being made in human institutions and in human
character&#8221;. Veblen&#8217;s &#8220;iconoclasm&#8221; flows in part from this coincidence
between his views and those of the revisionists. But, it should be
added that there is no foundation for the opinion that Veblen&#8217;s thought
was deeply indebted to Marx, as is sometimes inferred. Whatever should
be debited against Veblen on this score must be credited entirely to
the revisionists.</p>

<p>As regards the second point of divergence, Veblen sidestepped
Spencer&#8217;s ingenious correlation of biology with sociology only to
construct an equally fanciful synthesis of later-day psychology
(instinct-habit) with sociology. Instead of defining social
institutions and biological terms, he defined them in terms of
psychology: &#8220;The institutions are, in substance, prevalent habits of
thought with respect to particular relations and functions of the
individual and of the community.&#8221; In the last analysis, therefore,
Veblen&#8217;s views only superficially diverge from Spencer&#8217;s. Without
keeping this definition in mind, one may easily read into Veblen, an
outright idealist, a standpoint &#8211; i.e., Marxism &#8211; altogether alien to
him. Thus, when Veblen asserts that &#8220;the cornerstone of the modern
industrial system is the institution of private property&#8221;, he does not
at all subscribe to the Marxian standpoint. To him the substance of
this cornerstone is psychological. It is made of mind-stuff because all
institutions, including private property are in substance only habits
of thought.</p>
<p>Again, one meets with the assertion that according to Veblen the
primary motive force in social change is the advance of industrial arts
and the growth of science. This is an error; to Veblen this advance is
derivative and not primary. His position on this point is in all
respects similar to Spencer&#8217;s who also wrote that &#8220;the development of
the arts of life, consequent upon the advance of science, which has
already in so many ways profoundly affected social organization
(instance the factory system) is likely hereafter to affect it as
profoundly or more profoundly&#8221;.</p>

<p>To Veblen the primary motive force is the human mind. &#8220;Social
evolution is a process of selective adaptation of <em>temperament and
habits of thought</em> under the stress of the circumstances of
associated life.&#8221; When Veblen says that the development of societies is
the development of institutions he implies that the development of
institutions is the development of human motives. He does not at all
imply what Marx maintained &#8211; that the development of the institutions
and therefore of society is governed by laws not only independent of
human will, consciousness and intelligence, but rather, on the contrary
determining that will, consciousness and intelligence. Veblen accepts
no such laws; he derives the development of institutions from human
nature. In his definition he merely repeats what Plato said, to wit,
that &#8220;the states are as the men are, they grow out of human
characters&#8221;; a dictum which was rehashed by Spencer to read: &#8220;the forms
of social organization are determined by men&#8217;s natures&#8221;.</p>
<p>But just how do the social forms evolve? And why? Spencer accounted
for social change in terms of improvement, or progress: &#8220;only as their
[men&#8217;s] nature improve can the forms of life become better&#8221;. Veblen
recognized only cumulative and correlative changes in nature, and in
human nature. But his attempt to explain the causes that underlie the
variation of human nature is as age-worn as the mummies of the
Pharaohs. Far from being scientific, it boils down to the animistic
formula of explaining a phenomenon in terms of the spirit. Human nature
varies because it is the nature to vary; or, more exactly, the
variability of human nature is due to the stability of human nature. In
Veblen&#8217;s own words, &#8220;this variation of human nature ... is a process of
selection between several relatively stable and persistent ethnic types
or ethnic elements&#8221;.</p>

<p>No doctrine in sociology is more reactionary than the doctrine which
seeks to interpret human history and culture in terms of the racial
equation. The logic of his theoretical standpoint, or rather the lack
of logic, forces Veblen to align himself with the assumers of the White
Man&#8217;s Burden, and of White Supremacy. To subscribe to the existence of
certain stable types of human nature is to believe in the existence of
specific and distinct races. How many races are there in the blood?
Virey said two; Jacquinot claimed three; Kant found four; Blumenbach &#8211;
five; Buff on &#8211; six; Hunter &#8211; seven; Aggassiz &#8211; eight; Pickering
insisted on &#8211; 11; Bory St. Vincent &#8211; 15; Desmoulins &#8211; 16; Morton &#8211; 22;
Crawfurd &#8211; 60; Burke &#8211; 63 ... and the latest ethnologist, the supreme
specialist in blood, Hitler, recognizes the One and Only Race, the rest
of mankind being sub-humans. Veblen does not compute the number of
races the world over; he is concerned only with those races that have
created the modern industrial community, that is, the Europeans,
including the Scandinavians. His authority on European races is Ripley.
Their number is odd, being three: the Nordic, the Alpine, and the
Mediterranean races; or, in terms of the shape of the skull, and the
color of the hair: the dolico-blonds, the brachy-brunettes, and the
dolico-brunettes.</p>

<p>This is the history of mankind according to Veblen. In our
industrial communities, man tends to breed true to one or another of
these three main ethnic types. In their turn, these three stable and
persistent types tend to breed in two main directions of variation:
variant A and B; variant A, or savage human nature, the peaceable or
ante-predatory man with industrial virtues; and variant B, or barbarian
human nature, the predatory man with acquisitive virtues.</p>
<p>In the beginning there was savage human nature, primitive and
peaceable; and the forms of social organization which grew up conformed
to this human nature, all deviations from the norm being repressed by
natural selection. During this primitive and peaceable epoch of
savagery, man tended to breed true to type A of human nature. Society
evolved, without trend, without consummation. Savagery passed from low
into high and then into higher. And when the high times passed, society
entered into the epoch of barbarism, the period of predation and
exploit, the epoch of the system of status. All this came to pass
because slowly but surely variant B of human nature began to
predominate, and the forms of social consciousness that grew up
conformed to this human nature, all deviations from the norm being
repressed by natural selection. Society kept on evolving, without
trend, with no final term. From low, barbarism shifted into high. And
the higher stage of barbarism was feudalism, both European and Asiatic!
Imperceptibly, the struggle for existence passed into the struggle to
keep up appearances. There ensued the quasi-peaceable stage. And
presently came the dawn of the peaceable epoch proper, which is the
epoch of the modern industrial community, popularly misunderstood as
the capitalist system. And throughout the epoch of barbarism, and the
quasi-peaceable epoch, and the era of peace, man still continued to
breed true to variant B of human nature.</p>
<p>To recapitulate. There are two types of human nature, though the
skulls may be dolico, or brachy, though the hair be blond or brunette.
The savage type A, in each case, is nearer to the generic human type,
being the reversional representative of the type that prevailed at the
earliest stage of associated life; and representing the ancestors of
modern man at the peaceable savage phase of human development which
preceded the predatory culture with its regime of status and so forth.
This atavistic type is characterized by honesty, diligence,
peacefulness, good will, absence of self-seeking, and suchlike prosy
humanitarian traits. The barbarian type B, in each case, is the
survival of a more recent modification of the main ethnic types and
their hybrids, as they were modified, mainly by selective adaptation
under the discipline of the predatory culture and the later emulative
cultures. An individual of this type is characterized chiefly by
ferocity and astuteness.</p>
<p>The history of society has been the history of the natural selection
of these two types of human nature. Two social systems have prevailed
in history: the system of status, and the system of contract. The type
of the system of status is the military organization, or also a
hierarchy, or a bureaucracy. The other type is the modern industrial
community. The author of this method of classification is Sir Henry
Maine. And Veblen borrowed it from Maine as did Spencer who also said
that &#8220;societies may be grouped as militant and industrial; of which one
type is organized on the principle of compulsory cooperation; the other
on the principle of voluntary cooperation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Both of these systems were hard on type A of human nature. So much
so that modern man still breeds true to variant B, particularly the
Nordics (the dolico-blonds) who are &#8220;possessed of a greater facility
to barbarism than the other ethnic elements with which that type is
associated in the Western culture&#8221;. All this is according to Veblen.</p>
<p>And according to Veblen, should the type persist, so would the
system, since
the social institutions must conform with human nature. Is mankind
perhaps sentenced forever to the ascendancy of human nature type B,
with its prime exemplar the Nordic, and the institutions suitable to
its temperament and habits of thought? Or, may society continue to
evolve? According to Veblen, the answer is No to the Nordic and Yes to
evolution. From this flows a goodly share of his repute as iconoclast.</p>
<p>But why is the persistent barbarian not dominant eternally? First,
because variations occur with some frequency at all times, the
proneness of men to revert to the past being proverbial. Secondly
because &#8220;this barbarian variant has not attained the highest degree of
homogeneity or stability. The period of barbarian culture, though of
great absolute duration, has been neither protracted enough nor
invariable enough to give an extreme fixity of type&#8221;. And finally,
because there is a New Deal in store. Hitherto conditions have been
ideal for the breeding of variant B; and by natural selection those
stray orphans of type A that did manage to sift through were repressed.
The trend, however, is becoming favorable for variant A to reassert
itself, become dominant and suppress variant B, with God&#8217;s help, or,
rather, by natural selection. In our time the reversions to type A &#8220;are
becoming noticeable because the conditions of modern life no longer act
consistently to consistently repress departures from the barbarian
normal&#8221;.</p>

<p>Veblen&#8217;s saga of the struggle that has been going on the historical
arena between the two types of human nature suffers because it must be
submitted to examination not as the work of a poet but that of a
scientist. Allowing Veblen his flights of fancy, his races, his human
variants, social systems and epochs, he must still explain what it is
that operates to suppress the Nordic ascendancy so prevalent in modern
life, and what made it possible for the barbarian variant to emerge on
so universal a scale.</p>
<p>According to Veblen himself, the latter type is neither stable nor
homogeneous. It is further removed from the generic human type. On the
other hand, its relative by blood, but its antagonist by nature, type
A, is not only closer, but it had persisted over a period much more
protracted. The social forms which had been generated to meet its own
requirements must have tended to repress all departures from the norm.
Yet the gifts of &#8220;good nature, equity and indiscriminate sympathy&#8221; (the
characteristic traits of savage nature) did come to be repressed by
natural selection in favor of the barbarian type with its &#8220;freedom from
scruple, from sympathy, honesty and regard for life&#8221;. How come?
Veblen&#8217;s answer is nothing if not inspired. To put it prosaically, at
the root of social evolution, as well as of all evil, is human nature
again, but this time in a skirt. Just as the original male, Adam, was
ejected from paradise because of Eve, so women are responsible for the
entire course of history to date. Or, to put it in the language of
poetry:</p>
<table align="center">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>

      <p class="fst">&#8220;Who was&#8217;t betrayed the Capitol? A woman!<br>
&#8220;Who lost Mark Antony the world? A woman!<br>
&#8220;Who was the cause of a long ten years&#8217; war,<br>
&#8220;And laid at last old Troy in ashes? Woman!<br>
&#8220;Destructive, damnable, deceitful woman.&#8221;</p>
      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>
<p class="fst">Veblen&#8217;s version is equally masterful, due no doubt to
his Viking ancestry. Long, long ago, women, being feminine, applied
themselves to peaceable pursuits and industry; while men, by virtue of
their masculinity, resorted to predatory pursuits and exploit. Women
drudged, expending energy to create new things out of passive brute
material, while men converted to their own ends the creations of nature
and of mankind. &#8220;Virtually the whole range of industrial employment is
an outgrowth of what is classed as woman&#8217;s work in the primitive
community.&#8221; As a consequence, an early
discrimination arose between the employments of men and women: the men
tending naturally to look down upon feminine employments; the women
sullenly submitting as objects of contempt. From this original
invidious distinction between the occupations of men and women &#8211; whose
occupations coincide with the difference between the sexes &#8211; there
sprang up those institutions which tended to repress variant A in favor
of variant B. For obviously, under the regime of exploitation,
emulation and competition, the individual fared better in proportion as
he had less of the gifts of human nature A. In his appraisal of women,
Veblen agreed not only with the poets but with the patriarchs, among
them Spencer who held that &#8220;the slave class in a primitive society
consists of women&#8221;. Worse yet, women are directly responsible for the
institution of private property: &#8220;the earliest form of ownership is the
ownership of women by the able bodied men of the community.&#8221;

Destructive, damnable, deceitful woman!</p>
<p>Are women, perhaps, also responsible for the pending resurgence of
type A of human nature? Not quite. This time, it is entirely due to
evolution. With the dawn of modern enterprise social evolution enters a
stage unknown to natural evolution, or anyone else save Veblen. He
shares with no one the honor of formulating this discovery: &#8220;Under
modern conditions, the struggle for existence has in very appreciable
degree been transformed into a struggle to keep up appearances.&#8221; As a
consequence, the evolution of economic life &#8220;takes such a turn that the
interests of the community no longer coincide with the emulative
interests of the individual&#8221;. To millions in the world today who are
being forced to keep up the appearances of being alive while unemployed
this might sound like satire, but no satire was intended. The
formulation is a logical one, the logic pertaining to what Kant called
psychologic logic.</p>
<p>Veblen agreed not only with Spencer but with the revisionists that
under the modern regime &#8220;life is generally occupied in peaceful
intercourse with fellow citizens&#8221;. Peaceful intercourse and the
struggle for existence are mutually incompatible.</p>
<p>And this is how peace came to man. Originally type B had to
specialize in both force and fraud, mostly force. With the passage of
time, and the gradual improvement of industrial efficiency, predation
turned more and more in the direction of fraud. From being ferocious,
the barbarian by natural selection tended to become a specialist in
perfidy. Thus the era of rapine passed into the quasi-peaceable stages,
until finally the modern peaceful epoch of fraud was attained. So
peaceful that wars had become implausible. Spencer, too, was sure that
&#8220;the vast increase of manufacturing and commercial activity must lead
to a long peace&#8221;. All this is pure psychology.</p>

<p>Veblen brings the argument from psychology for every aspect of
social life. Thus, the ground for social unrest and the resulting
movement for socialism is &#8220;very largely jealousy &#8211; envy, if you
choose&#8221;. To Mill&#8217;s question, why has machinery not lightened the day&#8217;s
toil of any human being? &#8211; Veblen replies consistently enough,</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Because the increment of the output is turned to use
to meet the demand of conspicuous consumption, and this want is
indefinitely expansible.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">To sum up. In order to provide his Spencerian synthesis
of sociology with psychology, with logical consistency, Veblen had to
invent not only polar types of human nature but such human wants as the
indefinitely expansible human want of conspicuous consumption; not only
unheard-of instincts but also mystic broad principles or laws, such as
the Law of Conspicuous Waste. This law together with another Law of
Industrial Exemption affects &#8220;the cultural development both by guiding
men&#8217;s habits of thought and so controlling the growth of institutions
and by selectively conserving certain traits of human nature that
conduce to facility of life under the leisure class scheme, and so
controlling the affective temper of the community&#8221;.</p>

<p>These wants or principles or laws are Veblen&#8217;s embroideries upon
conventional economics; and they are as fraudulent (in a non-invidious
sense) as his <strong>Instinct of Workmanship</strong>. No such wants,
laws, and instincts are known to science as yet.</p>
<p>Veblen&#8217;s capacity for embroidering pre-conceptions is perhaps best
illustrated by his literary style. Let us take, for example, the
sentence just quoted above. Since the laws Veblen speaks of are nothing
but habits of thought: and since he defines institutions also as habits
of thought, this complex sentence merely sums up to the assertion that
habits of thought are engendered, controlled, selectively conserved and
so forth by habits of thought. Striving for precision, he achieves a
formality and massiveness so hypnotic as to put his readers into a
trance. Many critics have conceived of his writings as satiric, and
when they do not revile him, they speak of him as a ruthless analyst.
This opinion is largely unwarranted. Veblen was Spencer&#8217;s disciple even
in the sphere of style; what he strives for is not satire but
detachment, in the best scientific manner. He attempts to achieve in
his writings &#8220;an almost passionless consciousness&#8221;. For, as Spencer
held, &#8220;trustworthy interpretations of social arrangements imply an
almost passionless consciousness&#8221;. Without much difficulty one could
extract from Spencer&#8217;s writings as many &#8220;ruthless analyses&#8221; as may be
located in Veblen; and as like a close parallel could be drawn between
them. There is no more conscious satire in Veblen than in Spencer.
Veblen was no more of an iconoclast than Spencer.</p>

<p>It may be argued that Veblen was no supporter of the existing system
since he forecasted that the social engineers would build an industrial
structure &#8220;on a system different from either status or contract&#8221;. One
may just as well argue that neither was Spencer, since he also
forecasted that the future type of society would be a type differing as
much from the industrial as this does from the militant.</p>
<p>Those who insist on the contrary must begin by explaining Veblen&#8217;s
obvious lack of enthusiasm over the prospect of the future society, and
over the type of human nature that would be naturally selected under
the press of institutions:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Not much is to be said for the beauty, moral
excellence, or general worthiness and reputability of such a prosy
human nature as these traits imply; and there is little ground of
enthusiasm for the manner of collective life that would result from the
prevalence of these traits in unmitigated dominance.&#8221;</p>
