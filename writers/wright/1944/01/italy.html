<p class="c"><I>In September 1920 Italy was on the verge of revolution. A brief
history of this period follows:</I></P>
<p class="fst">The Federation of Metal Workers, which was soon joined by other
unions, including even the Catholic organizations and the nationalist
Italian Labor Alliance, presented the demand for a 35% wage increase
to meet the sky-rocketing prices, and set about to introduce the
8-hour working day by the self-action of the workers. Although the
movement embraced from the very outset more than 500,000 workers, the
Italian capitalists flatly rejected the demands.</P>
<P>The Metal Workers Federation then issued a call for a nationwide
general strike and summoned the workers to seize the factories in the
event of a lock-out. Despite this final warning, the capitalists
answered with lock-outs. The metal workers then proceeded to occupy
more than 300 enterprises in the Milan area alone.</P>
<P>The ruling class and its then reigning Giolitti government were
impotent. The troops could not be relied upon; the government did not
dare call them out. The movement rapidly spread to the metal workers
of all Italy who were joined by the workers in other industries.
Everywhere factories were seized, around them barricades were erected
and machineguns mounted by the workers. The peasants began dividing
the landlords&#8217; estates. Capitalism appeared doomed in Italy. <I>Left
without any resources in their own class, the capitalist could rely
now only on their labor agents.</I></P>
<P>On September 9, 1920 the Executive Committees of the Socialist
Party and the General Confederation of Labor, controlled by the
Socialist Party, met in joint sessions but could arrive at no
decision. The question was then referred to the plenary sessions of.
the national committee of the General Confederation of Labor. <I>In
other words, the leaders of the Socialist Party had in effect
abdicated; but there was no revolutionary leadership to replace them.</I>
The vital issues of 1921 were settled in Italy within the highest
trade union body.</P>
<P>Gennari (later one of the founders of the Italian Communist Party)
insisted, in the name of the Socialist Party on giving unlimited
support to the movement which had already passed beyond the limits of
economic demands and was actually being transformed into a social
revolution. D&#8217;Aragona, the then General Secretary of the
Confederation of Labor and one of the leaders of the reformist right
wing in the Italian SP, demanded that the struggle be confined to
economic demands; and agreed, as a last resort, only to the
introduction of workers&#8217; control of production.</P>
<P>The revolutionary elements were in the ascendancy in the ranks,
but in the top leadership arch-conservatives and vacillators
predominated. The resolution submitted by D&#8217;Aragona received the
support of the social patriot Turati, and of Serrati, who at the time
held a centrist position. With the support from the centrists, the
labor lieutenants of Italian capitalism triumphed: D&#8217;Aragona&#8217;s
resolution received 591,245 votes as against 409,569 votes for
Gennari&#8217;s resolution.</P>
<P>As a result of this close vote the leadership of the 1921 movement
definitively passed into the hands of the reformists who met with
Premier Giolitti and on September 15, 1920 formally renounced all
further struggle. They struck a bargain, telling the workers that
they must remain content with a promise of workers&#8217; control and other
concessions, all of which remained on paper.</P>
<P>Betrayed and beheaded, the revolutionary movement of 1920 was
quickly dissipated. The workers were compelled by their reformist
leaders to surrender all their conquests, to return the enterprises
to the capitalists. This plunged the Italian masses into dejection
and apathy. The road for reaction was cleared. In the absence of an
experienced revolutionary leadership capable of executing an orderly
retreat In the face of this terrible defeat through capitulation, the
triumph of reaction in Italy was guaranteed in advance.</P>
<P>The panic-stricken Italian bourgeoisie, saved in its last
extremity by the treachery and cowardice of the reformists, regained
its confidence and staked everything on the fascist gangs. By the end
of September 1920 the revolutionary advance was at a standstill;
November already witnessed the first major assaults of the fascists
against the workers&#8217; organizations (the seizure of Bologna). In the
months that followed, the fascists proceeded systematically to
destroy the Italian labor movement. At the end of 1922 the power
passed into the hands of Mussolini, thus sealing the victory of
counter-revolution in Italy, and stabilizing capitalism there for
another two decades.</P>
