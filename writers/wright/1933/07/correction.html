<p class="information">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1933/index.htm#tm33_36" target="new">Vol. VI No. 36</a>, 22 July 1933, p.&#160;3.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">In the article of L.D. Trotsky, <em>Historical Objectiveness</em> translated by Max Eastman and reprinted in the last issue of the <strong>Militant</strong> from the magazine <strong>Contempo</strong>, a typographical error was responsible for the following sentence, &#8220;But the last thing that the author had in mind was to interpret in his book the verdict of the historical process.&#8221; Obviously this is a mistake.</p>

<p>Trotsky could never make such a statement. In fact he wrote just the contrary. The error originates in the proofreader&#8217;s mixing up two sentences of the original article which reads as follows, &#8220;But the last thing the author had in mind was to console anybody. <em>He merely wished to interpret in his book the verdict of the historical process itself.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>Undue liberties were by the way taken, in the translation of the &#8220;bureaucratic stratum&#8221; (in the Russian mss.) as &#8220;the bureaucratic class.&#8221; We call the attention of the translator to the fact that in Marxist literature a fundamental distinction is made between &#8220;class and &#8220;stratum&#8221; (or &#8220;layer&#8221;) &#8211; the bureaucracy in the Soviet Union is not a class.</p>
