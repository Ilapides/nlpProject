Sy Landy, 1931-2007

Sy Landy, National Secretary of the League for the Revolutionary Party (LRP) since its founding in 1976, died of cancer at the age of 76 on November 28, 2007. As we continue our political activities, the members of the LRP and our international organization COFI (Communist Organization for the Fourth International) have been mourning our profound loss, while beginning to reflect on the lessons of his life. 

Born of the working class on May 7, 1931, in Brooklyn, New York, Sy (Seymour) Landy remained a champion of his class’s struggles to the end. Living modestly and fighting boldly for revolutionary politics, Sy resisted pressures to accommodate to this wretched imperialist world—in contrast to so much of  the left of his and subsequent generations. He told his comrades that the struggle for socialism had given his life its meaning  and remains humanity’s only hope. As a political thinker and leader, Sy Landy contributed more than any other individual in the past half century to resurrecting and advancing genuine proletarian revolutionary Marxism in the aftermath of the Fourth International’s decisive degeneration in 1952. 

Sy entered political life as a student at Brooklyn College in the early 1950’s, when there was no authentic revolutionary organization. Under the impact of the expansion of the middle classes and labor aristocracy during the post-World War II economic boom, the various left groups had in reality given up on Marxism’s first principle: that the emancipation of the working class must be the task of the working class itself. 

Sy joined the Independent Socialist League led by Max Shachtman, an organization which had separated from Trotskyism in 1940 in the name of the supposed “Third Camp” and  which had increasingly accommodated to American “democratic” imperialism and its trade-union bureaucracy. He was a leader of a left current in the Shachtmanite tendency that opposed Shachtman’s shift toward  the bourgeois Democratic Party and broke with Shachtman over his support for the U.S.’s “Bay of Pigs” invasion of Cuba in 1961. Sy helped found and lead  the Independent Socialist Clubs (ISC), which changed its name to the International Socialists (IS) in 1969. 
The late 1960’s saw the real turning point in Sy’s political life,  the beginning of a break that eventually led to the existence of the LRP today. He was inspired both by the Black ghetto uprisings that shook the major cities of the U.S. and by the powerful general strike of the working class in France in 1968. As he often explained, such mass upheavals were a demand for revolutionary leadership. Combined with a period of international travel and intensive re-study of Trotsky’s writings, these events drove Sy to fully grasp the power of the working class as a class, as well as the vital role that would have to be played by Black and other racially and ethnically oppressed workers around the world in building the international vanguard party.  

Sy became convinced of the need to revive the essentials of Trotskyism as the revolutionary Marxism of our time. It was necessary to “say what is” to the working class so that it could develop its own consciousness and capacity to make the revolution. And it was necessary above all to demonstrate in theory and practice to our fellow workers that, as Trotsky taught us,  “the world political situation as a whole is chiefly characterized by a historical crisis of the leadership of the proletariat.” Building the revolutionary party as the expression of the advanced communist  consciousness of our class was the key to uniting the working class and the oppressed in the fight for socialist revolution. (See our  list of pamphlets  for information about Marxism, Interracialism, and the Black Struggle and other pamphlets by Sy Landy 
and the LRP.)


Sy was the main leader of the Revolutionary Tendency in the IS, which became the Revolutionary Socialist League when it was expelled in 1973. He led a fight in the RSL against its degeneration, which led to the formation of the LRP to preserve and extend the RSL’s gains. The full lessons of the mass struggles of the period were drawn out in these factional struggles. 

Our understanding of the centrality of the working class and its revolutionary consciousness is fundamental to all of the LRP’s politics. In particular, within the international left, the LRP has become best known for its theoretical viewpoint on Stalinism and  the “Russian Question.” The analysis of Stalinism, the “Russian Question” and the epoch of imperialist decay is developed in detail in our book, The Life and Death of Stalinism, A Resurrection of Marxist Theory, by Walter Daum, for which Sy wrote the foreword.	

In writing this initial brief statement about Sy’s life and work, we must speak frankly. Since our birth in 1976,  the level of class struggle, in the U.S. especially, has remained far more stagnant than all of us hoped for. Since the LRP bases itself on the advancing class consciousness of our fellow workers, we have always understood that our growth would inherently be tied to the resurgence of class struggle and the desire of more workers to look for genuine communist politics as a result of direct experience. So we know that our feelings of profound debt to Sy and our admiration for him might be discounted by many—since our group is still small and our program of workers’ socialist revolution seems so outlandish to many who have given up on it. But  it would be a cynical mistake to discount our theoretical and practical accomplishments for such reasons. 

As Sy wrote in reflecting on the LRP, “Trotsky taught us to have little patience with those who judged an organization by size alone. Such people, he said, had only achieved trade union consciousness, not revolutionary consciousness. The decisive question in evaluating a political organization is the power and relevance of its political ideas. If our politics actually reflect the real interests of the working class and point out the road ahead, then with the necessary initiative and courage the numbers will come.” (“Twenty Years of the LRP”.) 

Sy loved life passionately and wore his heart on his sleeve. He could not suppress his affection for all his friends any more than he could hide his hatred of  capitalism, a bestial world system that was destroying humanity.  Full of personality, Sy certainly had his own human frailties. But he was an outstandingly fine leader to comrades young and old, extraordinarily patient and a deep source of support for many  friends and comrades. Sy Landy leaves behind no traditional nuclear family but a large chosen family of comrades and personal friends here and abroad. We loved him so.

ower (Britain): A Powerless Answer to Reformism









The following piece is a slightly edited version of an article which ran originally in  Proletarian Revolution No. 23 (Spring 1985). 

Workers Power (Britain): A Powerless Answer to Reformism
[Spring 1985] As we go to press, the year-long British coal miners’ strike, so crucial for the class struggle in this period, is reported to be ending. This article was written while the strike was still on and takes up theoretical and strategic questions fundamental to it. 


In two recent issues of this journal we dissected a book by the British Workers Power group (WP) on Stalinism in the Soviet Union and its post-World War II expansion.1 We argued that WP’s position was only a left-sounding attempt to explain the inexplicable: how anti-working class Stalinism is supposed to be able to make socialist revolutions. We concluded, “All the theorizing about Stalinism as counterrevolutionary but nevertheless progressive is, in reality, just a reflection of their parallel understanding of the counterrevolutionary leaders the working classes face at home.”
As if to prove this conclusion correct, Workers Power has issued a new major document, its “Theses on Reformism: the Bourgeois Workers’ Party,”2 which seeks to do for social democratic reformism what the book did for Stalinism. In this case it is of course impossible to rationalize revolutions made by social democrats, since there have been none. But it is possible, under the guise of an attack on counterrevolutionary reformism, to provide a justification for subordinating revolutionary politics to it.
Once again WP sounds very left. Its theses are directed not to those who idolize Stalinism or reformism but rather to politically advanced people who detest both ideologies and seek a revolutionary road. WP delivers a blistering attack against the right-centrist pseudo-Trotskyists who capitulate to social democracy. On the British scene it aims to reach militants who do not want to bury themselves in the Labour Party swamp or accept Tony Benn’s left nationalism in lieu of the revolutionary program. WP relies heavily on quotations and paraphrases from Marx, Engels, Luxemburg, Lenin and Trotsky. But the lessons of these communist teachers are bowdlerized and made mechanical—thus turned on their heads.
The very leftism of its cover is why such centrism cannot be ignored. The centrists of the past whom today’s leftists disdain as unspeakable traitors to the proletariat—the Kautskys, Martovs, etc.—were themselves once declared revolutionaries, but their ultimate role was to leave the working class in the hands of counterrevolutionary reformism. Our task is to make sure this doesn’t happen again.
The Contradiction in Reformism Workers Power’s answer to reformism begins by making a tremendous concession to it: WP believes that reformism is in part a “social gain” of the working class and a product of the proletariat’s development as a class.
A revolutionary understanding of reformism... must encompass both the recognition of its counter-revolutionary, bourgeois character and its origins as a working class gain, made in the class struggle” (page 52).
This idea is not a momentary formulation; it is repeated frequently in slightly different forms. For example, the article advocates “a dialectical understanding of the historic development of reformism as a product of the class struggle but yet also as a brake upon that struggle ...” (page 55). The plus side of reformism as a product of the class struggle originating in the proletariat is contrasted to its minus side, the “brake’’ originating in the bourgeoisie. This conception of the contradictory nature of reformism is central to the theses and is the key to the way WP understands the united front tactic, the cornerstone of its politics. But the idea that reformism’s contradictions are fundamental—that the contradiction between classes bisects this ideology—is untrue and has never been the Marxist position.
At first glance, WP’s characterization seems to derive from a failure to distinguish between reformist ideology and the parties that embody it. Indeed, the achievement of independent working-class parties in Britain, Germany, etc. were gains of the proletariat, created in the course of the class struggle. Reformism arose in opposition to Marxism as a tendency denigrating the “final goal”—socialism—that the class struggle aimed at. It argued that the daily struggle for reforms alone was sufficient to democratize capitalism and meet the needs of the workers.
Reformism was designed to prevent the workers’ (limited) organizational independence from the bourgeoisie from advancing to political independence—for the latter points to the revolutionary overthrow of bourgeois society. Forms of reformism dominated the British Labour Party from the start and came to dominate the German Social Democratic Party after a time. It is these parties, not reformism, that reveal the basic class contradiction within capitalism. Their major contradiction is between the reformism of their leadership and the proletarian nature of their social bases.
Reformism is not always embodied in an independent working-class party. In the United States, for example, there is reformism aplenty in the labor movement and on the left, but it stays within the bourgeois Democratic Party. In the neo-colonial world, reformism exists without resting upon independent parties created by the class struggle. Labor-linked politicians and bourgeois nationalists like Walter Mondale and Guillermo Ungo are examples. Of course, when the workers do break free of the liberal reformers, these types strive to limit class independence to organizational forms; they construct reformist parties on a working-class base to block the road to revolutionary consciousness. Their bourgeois origin shows the true nature of reformism, an alien parasitic growth that fastens on the working class in order to halt its movement and development.
Reformism Means False Consciousness
The reformist parties do embody historic gains made by the working class, but they use these gains against the workers. Their leaders become solidified as political bargaining agents within the system, resting upon the myth that the workers’ gains were won through electoralism rather than class struggle. The reformists teach that reforms prove the viability of capitalism, in contrast to revolutionaries, who teach that the gains show the power of the workers to overcome a system fundamentally inimical to them.
In sum, reformism is the ideology, i.e. false consciousness, produced by bourgeois society to contain class struggles: to deny their importance, offset them and finally break them. It is an invasive ideology, not simply another view within the working class as claimed by the magnanimous pluralists of WP. It is no “gain of the working class” at all.
There are of course divisions (contradictions, if you will) within reformism; the British Labour Party is rife with them. They may even reflect the fundamental class division but they are not the class schism itself; they are disputes among the reformists over how best to prevent the contradiction between classes from manifesting itself in struggle. The “left” of Tony Benn will be reconciled to Labour right when struggle breaks out and will capitulate to it. Trotsky foresaw this in the 1920s, Benn has already done it when Labour was in power in the 1970s, and he is doing it again in the coal miners’ strike (as Workers Power’s press itself often proves). We will return to examples of the Labour Party and WP in practice.
Reformism flourishes in periods of social peace, when the contradiction between the proletarian base and the reformist top is eased. But further mass eruptions can break this harmony along the fault line, proving to large, even decisive, sections of workers that reformism as a whole is hostile to the class’s needs. This is what happened in the 1917-21 period of revolutionary upheaval in Europe, when the (then revolutionary) Communist Parties were created by splitting the corrupted Social Democracies.
The Class Nature of Reformism 
WP’s real problem is not its apparent confusion between the class contradictions inside a reformist workers’ party and the reconcilable differences within reformist ideology. Rosa Luxemburg was right when she posed the question in class terms in 1899, well before reformism’s worst betrayals. “The question of reform and revolution, of the final goal and the movement is basically, in another form, only the question of the petty bourgeois or proletarian character of the labor movement.”3
Reformism may indeed be an outlook, even the predominant one, within the working class at any given time. Marxists have always understood that this is a passing matter; its duration may be long or short, but it does not represent the historic outlook of the proletariat. The fundamental interests of the workers are not tied to capitalism, a decaying social system that can survive in its epoch of decline only by ever more brutally bleeding the working masses.
On the other hand, the petty bourgeoisie has material interests deeply rooted in capitalist society. Its inevitable outlook is to reform the system’s inequities and to work for class peace through class collaboration. These are utopian hopes and in the end will not help the petty bourgeoisie any more than the workers, but its situation provides an element of reality behind the illusion that there exist possible alternatives between the capitalists and the workers. Of course, in times of deep capitalist crisis layers of the petty bourgeoisie are hurled into the working class or below and can follow a revolutionary proletarian alternative. (As well, individual petty-bourgeois and middle-class people can become revolutionaries long before and can tie their lives and their politics to the proletariat—by breaking from the interests and views of their classes of origin.)
Workers Power avoids Luxemburg’s class distinction between petty-bourgeois reformism and proletarian revolutionism. Likewise it avoids the term “petty-bourgeois party” often used by Lenin and Trotsky for a reformist party. Instead WP uses “bourgeois workers party.” This of course is not in itself wrong (and it too was used by Lenin and Trotsky): the parties do have a working-class base and do serve the bourgeoisie. But WP’s constant use of the latter formula and its studied non-use of the former avoid making clear just who controls the reformist party in the interests of capitalism. 

The members of the bourgeoisie itself rarely get their hands dirty and join labor parties. Layers of the petty bourgeoisie do their work for them. In the reformist parties there abound direct representatives of the liberal petty bourgeoisie in close collaboration with their counterparts in the union bureaucracy. For Marxists, the labor aristocracy, the base of the bureaucracy, is an alien petty-bourgeois intrusion into the proletariat, materially and ideologically “tied by a thousand threads” to other middle layers. Trotsky gave a different, scientific description in discussing the leadership of the British Labour Party: “the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia, including of course the labor aristocrats and bureaucrats.”4
Workers to Blame for Reformism? The petty-bourgeois characterization of reformist parties is more precise than “bourgeois workers party.” On the one hand, “petty-bourgeois’’ specifies the dominant layer of the party; on the other, it subtracts no content, since petty-bourgeois ideology is a form of, not distinct from, bourgeois ideology. But WP rejects the traditional term without ever explaining or even mentioning the difference. Why? Because WP disagrees with the formula “petty-bourgeois workers party.” For WP, reformism is not the outlook of layers of the petty bourgeoisie; it has its origin and base in the working class itself.
For example, while the theses refer to the labor aristocracy as a “caste” of the working class, its petty-bourgeois nature goes entirely unmentioned. As well, WP explains the origin of European reformist parties as the result of workers’ “pressure for reform” (page 50, twice)—rather than the reformists’ need to hold back the workers’ struggles with their socialist implications. Despite an occasional qualification that the reformists’ victory is “by no means an inevitability” (page 51), Workers Power holds that the workers get what they fight for—not that the underlying aspirations they fight for are betrayed. Thus WP blames the workers’ consciousness for their reformist misleaders:
“...in the course of struggles, new leaders, often of a militant left reformist variety, are thrown up. While different tactics may be necessary in relation to such leaders, they are not qualitatively different from the entrenched, conservative bureaucracy. They reflect the consciousness of the workers who elect them. As such they represent, and become the means of maintaining, the reformist limitations of the consciousness of these workers. (page 57, emphasis added)
In plain words, the benighted workers get what they deserve. This opinion WP justifies by a quotation from Trotsky on the Labour Party in the 1920s, which is worth repeating in full: 

The left-wingers reflect the discontent of the British working class. As yet it is ill-defined, and they express its profound and persistent endeavor to break away from Baldwin-MacDonald in left-oppositional phrases entailing no obligations whatsoever. They transform the political helplessness of the awakening masses into an ideological maze. They constitute an expression of the forward move, but also act as a brake on it. 5
Notice WP’s sleight-of-hand. Trotsky is discussing workers whose consciousness is moving leftward, but who are confused by their left-reformist leaders; the leaders are forced to reflect the workers’ forward motion in order to hold back the masses’ advance. In contrast WP suggests that while the new leaders move left they do so only within the limits of the workers’ consciousness; the workers delimit the advance of the leaders and thereby in effect hold them back! Indeed, note that for WP the workers get the blame not only for the new militant left leaders but also for the “entrenched, conservative bureaucracy,” the leftists’ close kin. For Trotsky it is the reformist leaders who set the reformist limitations; for WP the leaders simply enforce limits set by the masses.
A decade later Trotsky dealt with the same kind of argument from a centrist writer, in his famous essay on ‘The Class, the Party and the Leadership”:

A false policy of the masses is explained by the “immaturity” of the masses. But what is “immaturity” of the masses? Obviously, their predisposition to false policies. Just what the false policy consisted of, and who were its initiators, the masses or the leaders—that is passed over in silence by our author. By means of tautology, he unloads the responsibility on the masses. This classical trick of all traitors, deserters and their attorneys is especially revolting in connection with the Spanish proletariat.6
Workers Power makes use of the same “classical trick of all traitors” but more openly: it blames the wrong policies on the masses specifically. Its argumentation is precisely that of attorneys for the counterrevolutionary traitors.
Lenin on Consciousness

To buttress its view WP cites Lenin’s “famous and still contentious passage” in What Is To Be Done?: “The spontaneous working class movement is trade unionism, is Nur-Gewerkschaftlerei, and trade unionism means the ideological enslavement of the workers by the bourgeoisie.”7
Since “trade unionism” is a form of reformism, this passage appears to support WP’s position that reformism stems from the limitations of the workers themselves. It obviously requires a closer look, for WP is entirely correct on one point: this passage (like others related to it) is indeed contentious. 

We first note that Lenin’s statement here has been rejected in particular by Tony Cliff, the leader of the British Socialist Workers Party (SWP) which Workers Power broke from in the mid-1970s. A “rank and filist” like Cliff8 has a vested interest in claiming that the working class is inherently socialist, not reformist—not because of his profound faith in the capacity of the proletariat to reach revolutionary consciousness, but for the opposite reason. His strategy is to tailor his operative program to the reform and union demands the workers spontaneously raise under many circumstances; the SWP’s expectation is that even these backward, reformist views will, if carried out consistently, lead to socialism. Hence Cliff’s interpretation of Lenin is a cover for tailing working-class backwardness.
WP broke from Cliffism in an attempt to bring itself closer to Trotskyism, rejecting among other things Cliff’s view of Lenin. But as we will show, WP failed to transcend Cliff’s adaptation to backwardness, succeeding only in giving it a far-left form.
Lenin’s Revised Opinion
In citing Lenin, WP had the responsibility to carry his thought to its conclusion. If the working class is capable only of trade-unionist ideas, where does revolutionary consciousness come from? Unlike WP, Lenin didn’t dodge the question in “What Is To Be Done?”; he approvingly cited the then-orthodox conception of Kautsky and Plekhanov that scientific socialism is brought to the working class from outside, by bourgeois intellectuals. This is no small matter at all and is the basis for the real contentiousness of Lenin’s formulation!
Had WP completed Lenin’s thought it would have had to make its own theses more naked: reformism originates in the proletariat, revolutionism in the intelligentsia. This doesn’t look very leftish, so it wasn’t made explicit. But it is the meaning of WP’s point of view. Where else can socialist consciousness come from? The upper bourgeoisie? The peasantry? The Queen? No: once WP starts with its ideas of the workers’ limitations and with its citation from Lenin, there can be no other conclusion.
Lenin, however, changed his opinion. As Trotsky explained, 

According to Lenin’s representations, the labor movement, when left to its own devices, was inclined irrevocably toward opportunism; revolutionary class-consciousness was brought to the proletariat from the outside, by Marxist intellectuals. ... The author of [“What Is to Be Done?”] himself subsequently acknowledged the biased nature, and therewith the erroneousness, of his theory, which he had parenthetically interjected as a battery in the battle against “Economism” and its deference to the elemental nature of the labor movement.9
There are several well known statements by Lenin to back up Trotsky’s conclusion. One comes in a summary article about the 1905 revolution:

At every step the workers come face to face with their main enemy the capitalist class. In combat with this enemy the worker becomes a socialist, comes to realize the necessity of a complete reconstruction of the whole of society, the complete abolition of all poverty and all oppression.10
An earlier reference came during the revolution itself (here “Social-Democracy” is the pre-1917 name for the party of revolutionaries, later called communists):

The working class is instinctively, spontaneously Social-Democratic, and more than ten years of work put in by Social-Democracy has done a great deal to transform this spontaneity into consciousness.11

We note as a matter of interest that Cliff, in his biography of Lenin, cites both of these passages but elects to cut the second one off after the comma.12 Thus he turns the leader Lenin into the tailist Cliff. Workers Power, in bringing up the question without carrying Lenin’s views forward, commits an equal distortion.
Lenin here was not saying the same thing as in “What Is to be Done?”. These passages reflect the new understanding he operated on for the rest of his life, an understanding Trotsky came to share. The working class is not simply spontaneously trade-unionist. However, since the proletariat develops at different rates, if the most advanced workers do not intervene to lead the backward layers, then revolutionary consciousness will not be achieved by the class as a whole. Spontaneity is no answer; leadership by the revolutionary party, the proletarian vanguard, is decisive—the crucial question of our times. But leadership is a relation within the working class, not between intellectuals and proletarians. Building the Marxist party to lead the class is the only way to defeat the alien intrusion of petty-bourgeois ideology.
This very question illustrates the relationship between the proletariat and revolution that we have been arguing for. And it occurs even where communist leaders themselves have come from non-proletarian backgrounds. Lenin first recognized the inherent revolutionary capacity of the working class through the 1905 revolution—that is, as a lesson taught him by the proletariat itself. Similarly the workers and artisans of the Paris Commune had taught Marx and Engels the need for revolution to smash the bourgeois state apparatus, not simply take it over. The motto “learn from the masses” was corrupted into a patronizing lie by Maoists and other petty-bourgeois misleaders. But just as there is no revolutionary practice without revolutionary theory, there is no basis for genuine revolutionary theory without living class struggle as a guide.
’Til the Final Conflict
The Cliff tradition has as its hallmark the development of a “rank and file” opposition to the trade union bureaucrats. It echoes the current level of consciousness not of the most advanced workers, the Marxists, but of the union militants. It appeals to backward workers—obviously not the most backward, since it is not aimed at the right reformists or openly pro-bourgeois workers. And as Trotsky pointed out, adaptation to backward or immature consciousness of layers of the working class in reality means capitulation to the treacherous bureaucratic misleaders and their reformist programs.
Workers Power is also rank and filist, an immediate sign that its break from Cliffism is incomplete, for the notion is foreign to the Trotskyist method and tradition. WP’s version, naturally, is further left. It doesn’t seek to establish programmatic identity with the current level of militant consciousness. WP rejects the assumption that militant trade union consciousness carried out consistently will bring workers to socialism. For WP, reformist illusions are a product of the limitations of the working class’s outlook, limitations which the Cliffites formally (only formally) deny.
WP learned the problem with Cliff’s method in its own experience in the SWP, which tried in the early 1970s to recruit raw militant “rank and file” workers. Under such conditions the party becomes a mere pressure group for the rank and filists upon the reformist leaders. WP believes that until the masses of workers follow the revolutionary party, which must keep its program well above current spontaneous illusions, they will remain reformist. The party is the carrier of revolutionary consciousness:
Revolutionaries cannot content themselves with merely arguing for better and more effective ways of winning the spontaneous demands of the workers. Even where such demands have a progressive content (which is not always the case) it is the duty of revolutionaries to link the struggle for them to the historic mission of the proletariat, the conquest of state power. (page 56)
But Workers Power, as we have seen, accepts reformism as the normal response of the workers. Thus the confluence between the working class masses and its revolutionary mission will not occur until the very eve of revolution. The need for the revolutionary nucleus to organize its core cadre, iron out its tactics and criticize its foes remains constant: 
This alternative leadership can not triumph all at once but [only] partially, unevenly at first. Only finally does this struggle become one of conflict between mass parties, between sections of the proletariat grouped under the banners of reform or revolution.(pages 60-61, emphasis added)
A fatalistic and mechanistic outlook indeed, undoubtedly derived from living with the particular history of the British Labour Party. The workers, the class ultimately responsible for reformism, remain near-permanently in its grip. The significant section of the masses joins the revolutionary leadership “only finally,” when mass conflict is the order of the day. Fortunately, however, such a scenario is not only discouraging and mechanistic, it is also entirely wrong—just as wrong as the opposite notion that reformism grows over into revolutionism automatically.
The answer to Workers Power’s theory of “reformism until the final conflict” is the same as to the question of the class origin of reformism: the proletariat itself contains the potential for breaking from reformist illusions and achieving revolutionary consciousness.
Working-class consciousness in reality is a mixed phenomenon. Different layers come to a more advanced understanding at different times and rates; even workers with quite definite petty-bourgeois, conservative ideas frequently have aspirations which require revolution to fulfill. The resolution of the contradiction comes through action, class movement, struggle. For altered consciousness derives from practice rather than the other way around. That is, a change in the material condition of the class through struggle leads to changes  sometimes vast, overnight changes—in political consciousness. It follows that significant sections of the masses may achieve revolutionary consciousness well before the final conflict, depending on the balance of class forces, the workers’ victories and defeats, the ebbs and flows of the class struggle. This Marxist understanding is a far cry from WP’s mechanistic pessimism.
The Permanent United Front

The inevitability of reformism thesis dictates WP’s conception of the united-front tactic. This tactic has always been a central feature of its politics, ranging from everyday purposes in Britain to the “anti-imperialist united front,”—a class-collaborationist bloc it advocates in neo-colonial countries. (We have polemicized against this last position as held by WP’s Irish co-thinkers, the Irish Workers Group.13)
In Britain, WP’s united-front tactic takes the form of permanent critical electoral support to the Labour Party. Leninists understand that electoral support for reformist parties that were created by the working class is a principled and necessary tactic—when the promises or deeds of the leaders have succeeded in convincing the mass of workers in motion that electing them will do the working class good. Such support is by no means automatic, as Trotsky once noted succinctly: 

The possibility of betrayal is always contained in reformism. But this does not mean that reformism and betrayal are one and the same thing at every moment. Not quite. Temporary agreements may be made with the reformists whenever they take a step forward. But to maintain a bloc with them when, frightened by the development of a movement, they commit treason, is equivalent to criminal toleration of traitors and a veiling of betrayal.14
Yet Workers Power has given critical support to Labour even when the reformists were taking giant steps backward in an effort to break working class movement. It called for the re-election of the Callaghan government, the Labour government that was engaged in busting a mass strike wave in 1978-79 and so prepared the ground for the massive attacks the workers have suffered under the present Thatcher regime. (In much the same way Jimmy Carter’s austerity program in the U.S. both set the stage for Reaganism and helped get Reagan elected.) WP’s justification for this policy comes, they say, from Trotsky(!):
The tactic [of critical electoral support to reformist parties] has to continue to be used so long as the masses have not broken from their reformist leaders, even where revolutionaries might believe that the workers have already experienced enough to turn against them, a point once again made by Trotsky... (page 90)
And there follow a few lines of Trotsky’s which explain that the question of electoral support depends not on the revolutionaries’ consciousness but the masses’. Indeed, past reformist betrayals are not enough to deny critical support if the masses do not see their significance. But when the betrayals are immediate, the present deeds of the party in power, and when the workers in struggle are turning away from their betrayers...! It is again a matter of the WP’s idea of mass reformist consciousness which does not change even when the class is in motion. So in 1979 WP committed “criminal toleration of traitors and a veiling of betrayal.” It gave the following excuse in its press at the time:

As long as the masses wish to keep “their” parties in government rather than allow the open bourgeois parties to rule we support this elementary act of class consciousness.15
Again, WP blames its toleration of traitors on the workers—and calls it “class consciousness,” because reformism is precisely WP’s idea of what mass class consciousness is. Compare this passive fatalism with Trotsky:

The tactic of the united front still retains all its power as the most important method in the struggle for the masses. A basic principle of this tactic is: “With the masses—always, with the vacillating leaders—sometimes, but only so long as they stand at the head of the masses.” It is necessary to make use of vacillating leaders while the masses are pushing them ahead ... And it is necessary to break with them at the right time when they turn from vacillation to hostile action and betrayal. It is necessary to use the occasion of the break to expose the traitorous leaders and to contrast their position to that of the masses. It is precisely in this that the revolutionary essence of the united front policy consists.16 
Trotsky’s method demands a careful, selective use of the united-front tactic, basing it on the dynamic of working-class movement and consciousness—in particular, on the potential for the party to teach lessons to less advanced workers in the course of actual experience. WP’s static approach accepts as unvarying and natural the workers’ support for reformists even if this means teaching the workers the wrong lesson: back the reformists whether or not they are betraying a live movement.
We offer one more salutary quotation:
The series of related tactics that have become known as the united front must not be allowed to usurp their subordinate function. Any theory or practice which assigns to the united front, either in one of its forms, or via a series of united fronts, the role of an unbroken road to socialism is ipso facto unprincipled and can only lead to the systematic and progressive abandonment of the revolutionary program. With iron necessity it leads to the negation of the independent and conscious role of the working class in its own emancipation. It progressively downgrades and renounces in practice the role of a revolutionary party. It turns the united front from a weapon against reformism into a pretext for ideological surrender to, and organizational liquidation into reformism.
Exactly. The permanent united front strategy leads straight to the abandonment of the revolutionary party, the fundamental strategy for Leninists. It does this by denying the centrality and development of working-class consciousness. This quotation reads as a far-sighted warning aimed almost unerringly at WP’s specific practice; it reflects ideas permeating Trotsky’s work. Ironically it comes from Workers Power’s own theses (pages 59-60). The (self-)criticism of using the united front as an “unbroken road to socialism” is particularly telling when read in connection with another united-front tactic discussed below, the workers’ government.

For Marxists the real proofs are in practice, not theory. In the 1978-79 strike wave in Britain, WP steadfastly refused to call for a general strike.17 It calls for general strikes at other times but never under a Labour government, because such a strike poses the question of which class holds state power, not just who holds office for the bourgeoisie. A general strike would have destroyed the Labour government, and that’s why WP held back. Its fatalistic attitude toward the permanence of reformism leads inevitably to defending it instead of fighting for revolutionary consciousness through the mass struggle. The latter always seems premature and “sectarian.” For additional examples, we will take up WP’s activity in the miners’ strike later in this article.
The Labor Party in the United States

The theses contain a long section on the “labor party tactic” based on the history of the question in the American Communist and Trotskyist parties. It is a subject we are very familiar with, not only because we are U.S.-based Trotskyists but because our tendency was born out of a struggle in which the labor party question came to the forefront.18 This section of Workers Power’s theses proves just how badly they have to twist history and politics to justify their method. 
WP’s permanent support for the Labour Party translates to the American scene as a permanent call for a labor party in the United States. This has in fact been the position of all American pseudo-Trotskyists, stemming from misinterpretations of Trotsky’s first advocacy of the labor party tactic in 1938 for the U.S. Socialist Workers Party. Trotsky urged a positive response to the growing mass pressure to move the victorious labor struggles that created the militant CIO unions onto the political plane. His tactic was linked specifically to circumstances; previously, under different conditions in the 1920s and again in 1932, he had opposed using the labor party slogan. 
According to WP, he changed his mind in principle between 1932 and 1938: “Trotsky developed the Labor Party tactic by transcending his own previous objections” (page 78). Specifically, WP claims that in 1932 Trotsky thought that “the Labor Party could only be conceived of as a reformist party.”
Trotsky’s view boiled down to the proposition that the Labor Party was either unnecessary or reactionary. It would prove unnecessary if there was a mass upsurge of revolutionary consciousness—in which case a mass communist party would be formed. It would be reactionary if the trade union leaders were able to dominate the movement. This view was much less dialectical than his later position, since it excluded a situation which combined these phenomena—where the mass pressure for a Labor Party could be turned against the reformist leaders. (pages 77-78)
But this is not the case at all. Workers Power is so unable to recognize a temporary, flexible tactic that it overlooks practically everything Trotsky had to say on the question, or else deliberately chooses its citations selectively and dishonestly. First of all, Trotsky specifically stated in 1932 that an American labor party did not have to be reformist (although at that time he thought the reformist possibility was the more likely):
One can say that under the American conditions a labor party in the British sense would be a progressive step, and by recognizing this and stating so, we ourselves, even though indirectly, help to establish such a party. But that is precisely the reason I will never assume the responsibility to affirm abstractly and dogmatically that the creation of a labor party would be a ‘progressive step’ even in the United States, because I do not know under what circumstances, under what guidance, and for what purposes that party would be created.

It seems to me more probable that especially in America, which does not possess any important traditions of independent political action by the working class (as Chartism in England, for example) and where the trade union bureaucracy is more reactionary and corrupted than it was at the height of the British Empire, the creation of a labor party could be provoked only by mighty revolutionary pressure from the working masses and by the growing threat of Communism. It is absolutely clear that under these conditions the labor party would signify, not a progressive step but a hindrance to the progressive evolution of the working class.19
Trotsky Undialectical?
Trotsky was arguing that a labor party would probably be reformist, not that it inevitably had to be so. Although conditions changed, his reasoning is still useful today. Workers Power quotes the last few lines of this passage, leaving out the words we have emphasized above in order to make the Trotsky they disagree with sound dogmatic and undialectical. But Trotsky understood the labor party tactic perfectly dialectically in 1932 even when he was opposed to using it; this is our second point:

That the labor party can become an arena of successful struggle for us and that the labor party, created as a barrier to Communism, can under certain circumstances strengthen the Communist Party, is true, but only under the condition that we consider the labor party not as ‘our’ party but as an arena in which we are acting as an absolutely independent Communist Party.20 
There is nothing in this resembling WP’s undialectical “unnecessary or reactionary” counterposition, only a principled flexibility of tactics.
Third, even when Trotsky reassessed the class situation, he repeated that the previous position had been correct at the time. In discussions with American SWP leaders in 1938, he stated:
When for the first time the Communist League [the Trotskyist organization of the period] considered this question, some seven or eight years ago—whether we should favor a labor party or not, whether we should develop initiative on this score—then the prevailing sentiment was not to do it, and that was absolutely correct.21
Lastly, Trotsky “transcended” his previous objections only because the conditions of the workers’ struggle developed dramatically between 1932 and 1938—not because he developed some new principle. There occurred first the rise of the CIO and then the movement’s impasse, making political action unavoidable as well as necessary. In opposition to the union leaders (including the Stalinist CP) who wanted to support the bourgeois Democratic president Franklin Roosevelt, the SWP called for an independent working-class party, a labor party based on the unions—the vehicle through which the mass class movement was flowing. The SWP sought a way to align itself with militant workers open to having revolutionary ideas proved to them in practice. 
The Labor Party Slogan Today
Why then does WP insist that Trotsky’s principles, not just his tactics, changed between 1932 and 1938? Clearly because their theory of the inevitability of reformism mandates a similar stance for the U.S.—since the Americans have no labor party, the tactic of calling for one is perennially necessary.
By 1938 Trotsky had developed the Labor Party tactic into its most refined revolutionary form. The guidelines that he laid down remain valid today. ... Periods of economic crisis and sharpening class struggle are the most favorable for raising the Labor Party slogan. However, even during ‘calm periods’ the slogan retains a propagandistic value and can be acted upon agitationally in local situations or elections. For example, against support for a Democratic candidate in an election, revolutionaries would call on the unions to field an independent working class candidate. (page 79)
This tactic makes little sense in the U.S. today. In order for the labor party tactic to succeed conditions must change, almost as much as in the 1930s. The labor party slogan is useful when the workers are in motion, when they are seeking a political solution and when a section (at least) of the labor bureaucracy has moved left in an attempt to channel the movement back to reformism. Then it would be necessary for revolutionaries to join an open-ended labor party movement to get the reformists hands off it.
But today there is no left section of the bureaucracy; all wings compete to see which can capitulate most rapidly to the bourgeoisie and austerity. No doubt a left wing will emerge, sooner or later, but it’s not around now. And when it does appear it will be an attempt to squelch or forestall a workers’ movement—so again it is possible that “the labor party would signify, not a progressive step but a hindrance to the progressive evolution of the working class.” We cannot yet determine the coming balance of forces, but that does not prove Trotsky’s earlier position wrong under future circumstances. Workers Power cites Trotsky’s words from the early 1930s in order to show how wrong they were for the late 1930’s—but it does not occur to them how prophetic they are for circumstances like today’s.
That is why WP’s allegedly Trotskyist agitational tactic makes no sense. (In Bolshevik terminology, “agitation” means addressing concrete ideas to a wide audience, in contrast to “propaganda,” more complex ideas for a necessarily narrower audience.) It is possible to use a related but different tactic propagandistically: when a labor bureaucrat speaks to workers on behalf of a Democratic candidate, revolutionaries might point out that if the bureaucrats were serious about labor’s interests they would form their own party; but of course they are not. To call on such traitors to form a party or to run their own candidates, now, is to call for electoral action, not mass struggle. It plays along with the reformists’ present tactic of parliamentary diversions as an alternative to any and all mass class actions.
In last year’s presidential election, the union bureaucrats were the first off the mark to tie themselves to Democrat Walter Mondale, except those committed to Reagan and the handful for Jesse Jackson. He was known far and wide as labor’s candidate in the Democratic primaries and the election. Mondale and AFL-CIO chief Lane Kirkland were equally embarrassed by their inability to find a single political difference between them. There were of course leftists who shared WP’s general method and called on the unions to run a labor candidate. The response? “We already have one: Walter Mondale.” Such people could only counterpose the slogan, “Mondale via a Labor Party, not the Democrats.” A worse joke is hard to imagine. 
Before we move on, we must ask WP to identify just where Leon Trotsky “laid down” the guidelines it alleges. As a possible tactic for use at the proper time, of course. But as a permanent slogan, usable agitationally “even during calm periods” as WP says?
No; in fact, in the 1940 presidential election Trotsky did not use his new transcendent permanent labor party tactic. He called on the SWP to support Earl Browder, the Communist Party man, for the tactical reason that the CP at that instant was moving left. A layer of very advanced workers was ignited by the CP’s new-found pseudo-anti-imperialism and could be won to genuine communism through such a tactic. Trotsky was a tactician of skill, always seeking to win the most advanced workers by going through actual experiences with them. He was no petty maneuverist who tails backward consciousness until the big day bye and bye.
The Transitional Program
For all its distortions and the political logic that sets it up to capitulate to reformism, Workers Power tries hard to maintain a position to the left of reformism. Indeed, on all questions covered—the united front, electoral support, the labor party—WP seeks to criticize and oppose the reformists’ programs and establish an independent political basis for its separate existence. Precisely how it opposes reformism, and with what alternative, is therefore a critical question.
Does Workers Power counterpose the revolutionary program to reformism? Its leftism would make one assume so, but life is not so simple. At one point the theses warn, not only against accommodation to reformist politics when working inside a reformist party, but also that:
An unwillingness to take part in limited struggles for partial, non-revolutionary objectives and the counter-posing of the revolutionary program when the workers have not yet been won to it leads to the opposite danger of sectarianism. (page 82, emphasis added)
Of course, there are many situations when counterposing the revolutionary program to a struggle for reforms would be entirely wrong. On the other hand, posing the revolutionary program propagandistically (and counterposing it to the reformist program) is always necessary for Marxists. That WP is arguing against the latter in the guise of the former is clear from its justification: “the workers have not yet been won.” When the workers do not yet accept the revolutionary program, communists, it seems, ought not to raise it either. And remember, for WP the workers won’t become revolutionary until the final days before the revolution. So it appears that the revolutionary program isn’t about to get much exposure. 
But how can this be? WP often says things like “communists put forward their own program counterposing it to the reformist program” (page 88). This looks like a whopping contradiction—until you realize just what WP means by “their own program.” They mean the “Transitional Program” written by Trotsky and adopted by the Fourth International in 1938. Moreover, WP understands that this is not the revolutionary program.
The usual pseudo-Trotskyist assumption is that the Transitional Program is and was intended to be “the program of the Fourth International.” It is not: the Transitional Program was designed to be a bridge to the revolutionary program for masses of workers in struggle. Trotsky made this clear enough at several points in the document itself and especially in the discussions of it with his followers:
The draft program is not a complete program. ... the end of the program is not complete, because we don’t speak here about the social revolution, about the seizure of power by insurrection, the transformation of capitalist society into the dictatorship [of the proletariat], the dictatorship into socialist society. This brings the reader only to the doorstep. It is a program for action from today until the beginning of the socialist revolution.22
Why did the Transitional Program lead the workers “only to the doorstep” of the socialist revolution? Because Trotsky wanted the door slammed in their faces? Obviously not. At the time he wrote, the Fourth International was known as the uncompromisingrevolutionary party. Its task was not to endlessly repeat the revolutionary goal but to convince masses of its significance. Trotsky wrote a ‘bridge” program as a substitute for the old social-democratic “minimal” program, complementary to the revolutionary program of socialism. The bridge was meant to guide the workers to the point where socialism and the proletarian dictatorship could be proven in practice, by masses in motion, to be necessary goals:
The old ‘minimal program’ is superseded by the transitional program, the task of which lies in systematic mobilization of the masses for the proletarian revolution.23
The Transitional Program had a particular use for tactical intervention in reformist parties. As Trotsky observed, “We propagandize this program in the trade unions, propose it as the basic program for the labor party. For us it is a transitional program; but for them it is the program.”24 That is, they, unlike us, do not fight for the revolutionary program as well.
The Workers’ Government Slogan
Nevertheless, the fact that Trotsky left the program incomplete has enabled centrists to use it as a weapon against revolution. Key to its abuse is the “workers’ government” slogan, a tactic similar in many respects to the labor party slogan. It was designed by the early Comintern based on the tactics used by the Bolsheviks in 1917 on their road to revolutionary victory. The slogan calls for a workers’ “government” rather than “state” in order to push the non-revolutionary parties to the limit without demanding the impossible, that they become revolutionary and create a new state. It challenges reformist parties to follow the logic of their proclaimed “socialist” programs and take over the bourgeois state machine in the interests of the workers (and with the workers’ armed support), without concessions to the capitalists. Clearly such an eventuality would be highly explosive and momentary; it would lead quickly to a revolutionary crisis.
We have outlined this history and the theory behind it in our analysis of “The Myth and Reality of the Transitional program.” 25 But as we noted at the time (1979):
The workers’ government slogan is central to the misuse of the Program because it has been used in fact as a substitute for the missing slogan of the workers’ state. It is no coincidence that the organizations which make this substitution are the same ones that, thirty years ago, devised the theory that petty-bourgeois forces in Eastern Europe and China could substitute for the proletariat in making the socialist revolution.
Unfortunately this describes Workers Power exactly. WP does not propagandize for the proletarian dictatorship, the workers’ state. It does not counterpose the socialist program of revolution to reformism. Instead it calls for workers’ governments—not tactically, during the occasional conjunctures when this slogan appropriately exposes the vacillation of reformist parties, but almost always. This policy is presented in the final paragraph of WP’s theses: 
In general, except in cases of revolutionary crisis in which the question of power is raised, communists raise the workers’ government as propaganda for a real, revolutionary workers’ government, while at the same time demanding of reformist parties in government that they take concrete steps to break with the bourgeoisie and act for the workers. (page 96)
WP is prepared to call for a revolutionary alternative to capitalist rule, the workers’ state, only at the point of revolution—when workers are already convinced of the necessity of overthrowing the bourgeois state. Until then, the revolutionary technique for convincing workers that the workers’ state will be necessary is “propaganda for a ... workers’ government.” (We leave aside for now the “real, revolutionary” qualification given to this term.)
WP has it almost exactly backwards. When the mass of workers are not revolutionary, an essential task of communists is to win over the most advanced as revolutionary cadres. In the most extreme circumstances when class motion is only molecular, this can be accomplished only by explaining the most advanced Marxist conceptions to the few who can grasp them with a minimum of tactical maneuvering; it requires propaganda in the Bolshevik sense—for the workers’ state, among other things. The revolutionary program must be stated clearly and boldly so that cadres will have precise knowledge of what lies ahead.
Workers Power’s Centrism
However, when there is mass movement and new layers of the working class are moving from backward to advanced consciousness, a more varied pedagogy is needed. Masses learn through experience, not only discourse. Marxist tactics are meant to help them see through their illusions without meeting unnecessary obstacles. The extreme situation is a revolutionary crisis, when it becomes possible to reach broader and more backward layers of workers than ever before with concrete ideas. Here tactical considerations come to the fore (but even then we must not skip over the vanguard by obliterating the revolutionary program), and the workers’ government slogan may be useful. 
WP’s reversal of the two situations is characteristic of centrism; it maneuvers with Marxist truth instead of training the vanguard workers, and fools revolutionary workers (and itself) with the promise that “in the end” we will speak of true socialism. The end, of course, never comes.
It is possible, an attentive reader might suggest, that we are making too much of a mere, terminological dispute. After all, when WP says “workers’ government” instead of “workers” state,” they actually say “real, revolutionary workers’ government.” Couldn’t this have the same meaning as a workers’ state?
Yes, it could for some—but not for WP. There are many on the left (like the Spartacist tendency) who allege that for communists “workers’ government” can have no other meaning than “workers’ state.” This is wrong, however, and WP knows that it is. WP criticizes Zinoviev for equating the two, pointing out correctly that doing so “robs the slogan of its use as a united front” (page 92). But with this understanding that “workers’ government” is a united-front slogan, Workers Power also ought to understand that its near-permanent workers’ government slogan amounts to a near-permanent united front—the strategy WP itself calls “ideological surrender”!
In sum, the “real, revolutionary” rhetoric again shows WP’s leftism. It is not satisfied with Stalinist or social-democratic travesties; it wants a workers’ government which will lead directly to a workers’ state. But it does not want to say so in advance. As with the labor party in the U.S., by making a united-front tactic into its everyday slogan WP (in its own words: page 60, already cited) “assigns to the united front ...the role of an unbroken road to socialism,” an act which is “unprincipled and can only lead to the systematic and progressive abandonment of the revolutionary program.”
Whither Workers Power?
Communists must raise transitional demands as a crucial part of their action program to mobilize the masses. But they must be accompanied by precise propaganda addressed to the most advanced workers, pointing out that the real answer to the crises of capitalism lies not in the “bridge” demands of the Transitional Program (and certainly not in the leaders who won’t even carry those out) but rather in the program and party of socialist revolution. We show the way not only to the bridge but to its far side; bridges by themselves can be crossed either way.
Without this dimension the whole exercise becomes a capitulation. It gives no leadership to the advanced layer of workers, the revolutionaries whose existence prior to the final conflict WP fails to take into account. But these are the workers whom the revolutionary party needs most of all. WP’s method is to speak to relatively backward workers directly, instead of to advanced layers as a means of mobilizing the less advanced. Hence WP postpones not only the revolutionary program until the final days but the revolutionary party itself.
The party will not be created by fiat or by triumphal proclamation at some appointed day. It has to be patiently and painstakingly built over time, starting from the embryo of a propaganda group addressing itself to the advanced workers. As well, if it does not always address this layer, its essence, the revolutionary program, will decay and collapse.
The Test of the Miners’ Strike
The practical test of the year-long British miners’ strike demonstrates Workers Power’s failure to illuminate the revolutionary road. First of all, its criticisms of Arthur Scargill’s leadership of the strike have been mild indeed (although far stronger than most of the centrist tendencies). For example, WP continually calls not for a revolutionary leadership to replace the Scargill bureaucracy in the National Union of Miners but instead only for rank and file militancy and workers’ democracy. Early in the strike WP even urged Scargill to join in this effort:
If Scargill and the left are not to become lifelong prisoners of their positions they should lend their weight to the building of such a movement.
Their record to date suggests they will not, but should they do so we should welcome them without sacrificing our independence to them and their positions.26 
Should they do so! WP invitingly allows for an unlikely possibility that the left union bureaucracy would cede its power in the union and control of the strike to the ranks who are fighting so heroically. But it is impossible, and not just because of “their record to date.” It is because of their petty-bourgeois character, the fact that they serve capitalism and work for its preservation, not its destruction.
More recently WP has become more critical, but not because it recognizes the alien class nature of the reformists. Rather it sees Scargill as a bureaucrat limited by the narrow horizons of his office. This is how it explains Scargill’s sellout deal with the TUC in September rather than forging a link with striking dockworkers and seizing “the best opportunity for kick-starting a general strike”:
The reason for this is exactly the same as the reason for the mistake over the national strike call. Scargill and the other leaders were not prepared to breach the norms of bureaucratic diplomacy by demanding that the leaders act and preparing to pass them by and go straight to the rank and file of the other unions if they failed to do so. The truth is that Scargill does not want to be placed in a similar situation when asked for support from other workers. He wants to make sure ... that he is in control of any action taken by his members. To ensure this he sticks to the bureaucratic rules of the game with other leaders.27
WP employs the anti-Trotskyist concept of pitting “the rank and file” against the bureaucrats because it sees both as functional positions within the working class. The class-decisive contradiction is between proletarian and petty-bourgeois leadership. The union bureaucracy, even its leftmost sections, is not simply a “caste” of the working class but a class intrusion that must be overturned.
That is why WP is soft on the Scargills. To the extent that WP ever mentions revolutionary leadership for the strike in its press (very rarely), it is raised as an image of more consistent militancy. But WP is careful not to counterpose it to Scargill in any foreseeable circumstance. Instead, even when NUM militants had become seriously disillusioned with their leaders’ handling of the strike, WP concluded an “Open Letter from the Workers Power Editorial Board” with its incessant rank and filism:
With the officials if possible, without them when necessary must be the battle cry of a reborn rank and file movement in the miners strike. The events of the last weeks show that many militants are no longer prepared to leave the running of the dispute to the NEC. It is from these ranks that a force can be built to take the strike back onto the offensive and onto the road to victory.28
Once again there is no call to replace Scargill by a revolutionary leadership. By not counterposing revolution to reform and by accepting  reformism’s durability, WP restrains revolutionary minded workers from building the necessary opposition in the NUM.
This failure extends also to the Labour lefts. WP prides itself on its exposure of the right-centrists’ adaptation to Tony Benn and its own refusal to bury itself, like them, in the Labour Party; as well, WP correctly condemns them for not raising the general strike slogan seriously and consistently. But WP does not tell the workers the full implications of a general strike and thereby explain why the others do not demand it: the general strike poses the question of state power—which class, not just which bourgeois party, shall rule. Although WP poses the general strike agitationally as a necessary defense of the unions under Thatcher’s attacks, it typically refrains from going beyond this to clarify the revolutionary path a general strike would open up. For Marxists there is one crucial programmatic point at this stage: the necessity of a revolutionary party to fight for the leadership of the general strike.
Some months ago, however, WP elaborated a lengthy scenario for winning the strike.29 This included having Labour come to power and then workers revolting against it when the Labour government tries to suppress their independence. And only then, at the point of revolution, did WP’s scenario mention the necessity of a revolutionary party. For all its criticisms of Labour, for all the betrayals by Kinnock and Benn that it exposes, WP never once points out the need for the workers to destroy this reformist obstacle to their success. Thus Workers Power promises to carry out in practice its assumption about the inevitability of reformism.
As the struggle heated up, WP wrote the following, its boldest formulation yet:
A tremendous fissure has opened up in the Labour Movement between the militant rank and file activists who have rallied to the miners and the bulk of the union officials, councillors and MPs who have not. This should not be cause for complaint—for laments about unity. ... An all out war is needed to help the miners win and the quislings in our own ranks should be shown no mercy.
In the unions first and foremost—but necessarily and vitally in the Labour Party too—the class fighters must be rallied for a life or death struggle against the class traitors. Then we shall see where the waverers and appeasers stand. This strike has shown the working class doesn’t need a ‘broad church.’ It needs a mass party of the class struggle. It needs a party dedicated to overthrowing capitalism and able unequivocally to throw its full organized weight into each and every battle [against] the bosses. To this end the militant miners and all their supporters should dedicate themselves in 1985.30
Despite all the fierce rhetoric, this is a deliberate muddle. What party does WP want—a revolutionary party or a refurbished Labour Party? A party “dedicated to overthrowing capitalism” must be a revolutionary party. Marxists and many advanced workers know this, but WP as usual refuses to say explicitly that a revolutionary party must be built and treacherous Labour must be smashed. And since the argument stems from the “fissure in the Labour Movement” which includes MPs, WP is talking about a “war” to radicalize Labour. Without admitting it plainly, this position calls for a reconstituted Labour Party, an idea rejected in the theses because Trotsky rejected it so vehemently.
A further point: since the Labour Party is “necessarily and vitally” where the waverers and appeasers must be tested—by what right does Workers Power stand outside the party where this decisive struggle must take place? Why does WP not counsel workers not in the Labour Party to join it and help wage the decisive fight? Why does WP abstain from this course itself? The political logic of WP’s position is to join Labour and thereby edge into the left-Labourite embrace. This article almost says so, but its entire analysis of reformism points in that direction.
If reformism is inevitable until the final conflict, if reformism is a deformed gain of the working class, then despite WP’s subjective leftism (which makes it reluctant to join the other pseudo-Trotskyists buried in the Labour Party), their road is wide open. Workers Power’s capitulation will be slower and more contradictory than the run-of-the-mill pseudo-Trotskyists, but no less certain and no more revolutionary for all that. Our hope is that comrades inside WP who take its subjective revolutionary urges seriously will break in time from their centrist theory which still vacillates between revolutionary desires and reformist practices.
For a New Militant Leadership
Even leaving WP’s particular views aside, there is another consideration that seems to call for joining Labour: the number of revolutionaries is tiny compared to that of the reformists, so a simple counterposition of a small group to mass reformist “unity’’ appears to pit weakness against power. The problem is real, but the Labour Party answer is wrong.
At the level of the NUM, many militant strikers now see through the left leaders. Trotskyists must find ways to show them the way forward beyond simply countering reformist numbers with Marxist ideas. Given our distance from the situation our tactical offerings can only be tentative; would-be revolutionaries in the struggle must propose their own. From our perspective we would call for a new militant leadership of the union, dedicated to the fight for a general strike, to replace the current vacillators. It is not enough to urge the “rank and file” to force the leaders to fight on, since Scargill has no strategy that can win. Continuing in this way adds to the workers’ frustration. We propose a different road.
Within our call for a new militant leadership (a united front proposal in the same sense as the labor party slogan for the United States when it is applicable), we would explain our view that such a leadership should be revolutionary—the only kind that will fight capitalism’s onslaught consistently. We hope to join in the fight for new leadership with the best militants, including those who do not yet see that revolution is possible, and prove to them in the course of struggle that it is.
At the political party level we have a similar approach but with important qualifications. Many militant workers do have illusions in the Labour left and its “support” for the miners, as opposed to the Kinnocks. We do not call for Labour to power at this point, since the reformist party is engaged in an atrocious act of betrayal. We also warn that Benn is betraying too and that, in the time-honored tradition of Labour lefts, he will not fight Kinnock. (This includes the Bennite pseudo-Trotskyists.) But since we do see that the fight of the miners against capitulation is reflected inside the Labour Party, we also have a united front orientation there—not, however, the same as WP’s.
The Labour Party is lock, stock and barrel a petty-bourgeois party which unfortunately retains its working-class base. The question for us (certainly not for WP!) is how the working class can use its mass struggle to break Labour’s grip on its base. We therefore challenge the leftists and far-leftists inside Labour, who think that their party is redeemable, to choose between the working class and the party. We challenge them not only to fight for a general strike along with those miners and other militant unionists who are doing so. We also ask them to fight to make the Transitional Program the program of the Labour Party instead of its present reformist program or the left-nationalist Bennite equivalent.
We appeal to the left Labour groupings because many of their adherents are workers who believe a fight should be made for victory. We unite with them in the sense that we fight for the same transitional and general strike demands in the unions and among workers outside of Labour. The struggle will prove which of us is right: whether the Labour Party is redeemable for socialism or, as we predict, it must be smashed as an obstacle in the proletariat’s path.
Their leaders among the Bennites and the far-left cheerleaders will capitulate in the course of such a struggle (if they ever begin it). We believe that the militants will have to join in building a revolutionary communist party in order to win. The leftists and far-leftists are welcome to try to prove wrong our contention that such a new party is required. But at least the pseudo-Trotskyists ought to join in the demand that Labour adopt the Transitional Program: that, after all, was a major tactic that Trotsky developed that program for.
Through this tactic we can appeal to a large number of workers not simply to join a handful of revolutionaries but to build a mass party as an alternative to reformism. Our open advocacy of revolution coupled with our tactical usage of united front demands stands in sharp contrast to the centrist fudge propagated by Workers Power, the leftmost of the pseudo-Trotskyists. Reformists say that the final goal is nothing; centrists affirm the goals but only as a promissory note for raising them in the far-off future. Communists now and in the future disdain to hide our revolutionary aims. Everything we do is designed to make them perfectly clear.
To sum up Workers Power’s stance toward reformism, we note that its theory is as manipulative as its practice. Centrist theory is naturally ambivalent since it utilizes revolutionary concepts to cover for reformist conclusions. WP has tried to crystallize such ambiguity into a permanent method. 
In our previous polemic against Workers Power, we referred to Trotsky’s position that the USSR could only exist for a historical moment in the contradictory form of the counterrevolutionary workers’ state which it had become. We noted WP’s contrary view that the contradiction could survive for over half a century and would be resolved only in the bye and bye. On this basis WP finds it possible to be very critical of Stalinism while still maintaining a perennial defensist position toward it—and thus essentially apologizing for it. 
Not by accident, WP employs the same technique in its left-sounding apologia for social-democratic reformism. That is, it insists that the counterposition between revolution and reform will indeed occur—but always safely in the future. Once again, this gives WP the luxury of radical criticism—but when the chips are down, WP defends reformism. The upshot is that Workers Power gives socialism-via-parliament a new theoretical crutch in the form of socialism-via-postponement. It is not a revolutionary contribution to Marxist science.

Steve Zeluck died on March 1, 1985 at the age of 63. He was a political opponent of ours; we mourn his death.
Our sadness does not derive from any notion of Marxist charity now that he is gone. Patronization of the dead is worse than of the living, since the dead cannot defend themselves. We respected Comrade Zeluck when we fought him in life. Now we respect his memory while we continue the combat against those who maintain his political legacy.
First it must be said that Steve’s whole life was dedicated to the struggle by the proletariat for a new, humane, socialist world. In our opinion, his strategy for this struggle was contradictory and self-defeating. He was killed by capitalism not, however, because of his mistakes but because of his devotion to the working-class mission.
Steve’s recent death from mesothelioma, cancer of the lining of the lung, was caused by exposure to asbestos while working in the Philadelphia Navy Yard in the early days of World War II. He took a job there prior to being drafted as a political act, as a member of a revolutionary party seeking to lead his fellow workers in the class struggle; the communist goal, which he shared, was to turn the imperialist world war into a civil war against capitalism and for the rule of the working class.
For years the capitalist bosses had been well aware of the fact that asbestos was a killer. But they suppressed this knowledge, did not warn the workers, and made no adequate safeguards for the workers’ health. In this they had their priorities perfectly straight. After all, if they were willing to set in motion the slaughter of millions of workers-as-soldiers in fratricidal war in the interest of profits abroad, why stint on human sacrifice at home? As a result, Steve Zeluck, like many of his fellow workers, was murdered by capital.
 
The Struggle for Trotskyism
Steve became a Trotskyist as a young man in the late 1930s. He served both as a union activist and as a theorist and writer. He also lived through many of the decisive internal battles in the Trotskyist and ex-Trotskyist milieu. He continued his industrial work after the war at the International Harvester plant in Chicago, where he participated in militant strike action. Later he became a teacher and a leader in the United Federation of Teachers, where he fought the right-wing social-democratic Shanker machine.
He left the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party in 1940 with the Shachtman split, a tendency that tried to mask its gradual turn towards the U.S. labor bureaucracy while highlighting the more evident dispute over the class character of the USSR. Within Shachtman’s Workers Party, he turned to the left and joined the “state capitalist” Johnson-Forest tendency led by C.L.R, James and Raya Dunayevskaya. With them he re-joined the SWP after the war, and when Johnson-Forest left the SWP in the late forties in a break from Trotskyism, he stayed behind as part of a loosely organized tendency including Art Fox and other union militants. As the SWP turned increasingly in the direction of middle-class radicalism, Zeluck and many others were dumped by the wayside in the mid-1960s.
In 1971 Steve joined the International Socialists (IS), a left-centrist Shachtmanite group strengthened by the New Left movement of the 60s. The IS was one of the first groups built during this period to turn to activity in the working class, but it was doing its best to bury the remaining shards of its revolutionary Trotskyist tradition. It presented itself as a militant trade unionist outfit seeking to spark a rank-and-file struggle for reforms and democracy.
The deepening capitalist crisis that set off the IS’s growth also led to its shattering. There were mass eruptions throughout the world, including the French general strike. In this country the black ghetto rebellions and the rash of wildcat strikes in the early 70s inspired new struggles, splits and expulsions within socialist groups. Among these was the 1973 fight of the Revolutionary Tendency in the IS that became the LRP of today, aimed at reconstructing a Trotskyist organization (see The Struggle for the Revolutionary Party in Socialist Voice, No. 1).
Although he still identified himself as a Trotskyist, Steve remained loyal to the IS up to the point when its sole interest in union reform led it to embrace the left wing of the bureaucracy. This was too much for Steve and others, who reluctantly left in the late 70s to form the Workers Power group and publish the non-organizational magazine Against the Current, which he edited. This was Steve’s political home until his death.
 
Steve’s Broad Left Strategy
Workers Power and Against the Current embodied Steve’s conception that all tendencies of what he regarded as the broad revolutionary left ought to unify despite their serious political differences over the crucial questions of our time. The groups’ program had therefore to be vague enough to embrace as many disparate elements as possible. In Zeluck’s view this multi-tendencied mélange would succeed if it held a common approach to rank-and-file union reform. He drew the line against support for the capitalist Democratic Party and against submission to the left union bureaucrats.
“Rank and file” groups within the working class had been a hallmark of the original Shachtmanites. The idea was nurtured during and after the war, in opposition to the position of the then communist SWP for building the revolutionary party in industry as the alternative to the bureaucracy. The Shachtmanites inevitably capitulated to the bureaucracy (right as well as left) and the Democrats. Today they are the core leadership of both the Social Democrats USA (Lane Kirkland’s strategists) and the trendy Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). The IS was born in a fight to preserve the earlier forms of Shachtmanism – a labor party and rank-and-filism – against the Democrats and bureaucrats. But because it never broke from the basic Shachtmanite assumption that militant reformism was the place to start, the IS ended up traveling on the same road to the right that it once fought against, albeit more slowly and hesitantly.
Steve too, despite his greater subjective leftism, still accepted the basic militant reformist strategy. Fittingly enough, at the memorial meeting held for him in New York on March 24, the upcoming re-merger of Workers Power and the IS was announced.
It is no accident that Steve’s grand perspective for regroupment has produced only the impending reunification with the remnant of the IS (and perhaps also a wing split from the Socialist Action outfit, itself recently expelled from the SWP). The real object of Steve’s (and the IS’s) desire was the large ex-Maoist milieu, in great disarray since the death of Mao Zedong and the exposure of China’s pro-U.S. activities. But the elements emerging out of the collapse of “anti-revisionist” Stalinism are uninterested. They have no need for impractical halfway houses that fight for reformist programs but refuse to embrace the only potential power centers for those programs, the left-tinged bureaucracy and the Democratic Party. Many New Left and Maoist veterans, some of them in the DSA, now serve as left covers and water carriers for the union misleaders. The effort to reconstruct an earlier, less capitulatory stage of Shachtmanism to avoid this path is as futile now as in the 1960s.
Multi-tendency centrist amalgamations like the ones Zeluck spent much of his life fighting for are inherently unstable; they maintain a tenuous existence only during periods of working-class retreat. But when the workers erupt, they have to choose between the real alternative programs: reform and revolution. The centrist groups split, recombine, flare up momentarily but then die out. They have always done so and always will.
Steve Zeluck was a fine teacher, especially patient with younger comrades. Many of us learned many things from him that arm us to this day. One reason was that he was genuinely concerned with what less experienced comrades had to say. In contrast to many of those who pass for leaders on the left, he never attempted to set himself up as demigod or guru spouting perfect wisdom. He likewise made a point of knowing his opponents’ views. He was always above the “anti-dogmatist” attitude that the opinions of small minorities, or of opponent tendencies, could be ignored out of disdain for the significance of their numbers.
Unfortunately his political course dictated a political and theoretical inconclusiveness which fed into the malaise enwrapping the left today. It encouraged young comrades to make uncertainty into a positive virtue, to identify political sureness and intransigence – qualities that were characteristic of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Trotsky, Luxemburg and our other great forebears – with dogmatism and shallowness.
 
Steve’s Theoretical Ideas
Steve’s comrades at the New York memorial meeting praised him repeatedly for the ideas he contributed – without mentioning what they were (aside from the regroupment perspective they share with him). Let us correct this omission, if only in brief outline.
In the mid-1950s he wrote two articles [1] under the nom de plume David Miller for the SWP’s theoretical journal on the role of state capitalism in China and other ex-colonial countries; these are still valuable sources of information and theoretical insight. He argued in particular against the prevailing, cynical view that statified capitalist societies like Maoist China’s were workers’ states, however deformed, transitional to socialism.
His later theoretical legacy is more ambiguous. In his own journal in the 1980s, he published two critiques of currently popular economic conceptions, the monopoly theory of Baran-Sweezy and others and the dependency theory of “third-world” backwardness. He convincingly attacked Baran-Sweezy’s anti-working class assumptions and their reformist logic leading to the strategy of working through the bourgeoisie’s state machine and its political parties. He also nailed the bourgeois nationalist logic of the dependency theorists. But in doing so he implicitly accepted these reformists’ claim to uphold the Leninist theoretical heritage. While Steve acknowledged that Lenin’s view was not the same as today’s third-worldists’, he ignored what Lenin considered the key question: the imperialist epoch and its close link to the development of monopoly. Without this understanding, Lenin’s strategy of building an intransigent revolutionary party becomes just one option to discuss among many.
 
Refusing to Draw Lines
On the same lines, in his critique of underdevelopment theory, he amassed evidence that capitalism has advanced the productive forces in certain ex-colonial and semi-colonial countries – but neglected to raise the question of whether this contradicts Lenin’s conception of the epoch and Trotsky’s theory of permanent revolution. Arguing against “dependency” while leaving these points unmentioned implies that a backward country in this epoch can rise to autonomous, even imperialist, levels – a possibility that both facts and theory dispute. As a result, Steve’s reluctance to either affirm or openly confront the Leninist-Trotskyist tradition left open the sort of reformist conclusions that he spent his life in combat against.
Steve was caught between his strong allegiance to the working class and revolution on the one hand, and his constant effort to broker a left regroupment on a least-common-denominator basis on the other. While he was committed to rigorous Marxist theoretical analysis of fundamental questions, his mÃ©lange strategy inevitably prevented him from drawing sharp political conclusions. Of course, sharp political conclusions are the only point of theoretical activity for Marxists. But Steve’s deep and sincere interest in Marxist theory produced less than it should have because his efforts remained probes; he fell short of the kind of illumination his abilities and interest promised. And whenever faction fights broke out, even those over serious questions, the story always was that “Steve is somewhere in between.”
Workers Power, for example, has no defined position on the “Russian question.” (In the last decade Steve’s own view was that the USSR was more progressive than capitalism but less so than socialism. He may have been more precise than that, but if so we never knew. He was so concerned to reconcile opposing views that he didn’t crystallize his own.) The differences are vast: some see it as a workers’ state on the path to human progress, although perhaps stalled; others as a reactionary blockade to socialism. Obviously this affects one’s view of what socialism is and how to fight for it. Workers Power is devoted to discussing the need for a discussion of such vital questions but is absolutely adamant in refusing to come to conclusions which would draw lines.
In pursuit of his unifying mission, Steve demonstrated tact, patience and diplomatic skill. Yet he was also an embittered man who could, and did, explode upon occasion. Bitterness was not an uncommon trait among the generation of communist militants who entered industry in the 30s and 40s expecting to see the revolution in their time. Their sacrifices and dedication were mocked by their former comrades who sold out or capitulated when the post-war prosperity bubble inflated. When the surviving militants saw that the revolution had to be postponed to the indefinite future, they realized that their whole lives would be spent within the capitalist society they hated. Their tragedy is ours too. If Steve’s devotion to the working class was marred by a certain cynicism over its potential for revolutionary consciousness (as it was, in our opinion), we can understand his outlook even though we are hostile to it.
When we fought Steve in the IS in 1973, he took an extremely hard line against us, as we did towards him. He attacked us as unregenerate sectarians whose insistent evocation of Trotskyism would frighten off positive developments within the IS. We jeered at him as a “creeping Trotskyist” who believed Trotskyism could triumph without an open fight. When he took a stance between our tendency and the majority leaders, we attacked him for being firm against his left and soft towards those on his right. In that fight the truth was not “somewhere in between.” The I.S. did not creep toward Trotskyism; it galloped away, even when our spectres were no longer there to haunt it.
 
Steve’s Political Tragedy
Marxists would normally commend another socialist’s honesty, dedication and courage and then pass on, since such characteristics should be expected. These days, however, the defeats that embittered Steve have made others viciously cynical and vindictive. Steve was not like that. In a decadent milieu full of supreme leaders with small souls, he was a decent man. Faction fights in particular can be notoriously venomous and frequently dirty. In all of our battles with Comrade Zeluck, we knew him to be an honest and political opponent, never petty or personalistic. In recent years, when others have sought to use narrow organizational means to prevent opponents on the left (such as ourselves) from speaking at meetings or participating in events, Steve – just as hostile to us as were his friends – relied on political means and political ideas to fight with. We respected him despite our political hostility; we believe the same was true for him with respect to us.
Steve Zeluck lived an honorable life fighting “against the current.” Tragically, he was unable to find the channel through the rapids. We in the LRP are also dedicated to working-class unity, but in our view the key to that achievement at present is to fight for the general strike – unity in action as opposed to the unity over minimal reform programs that Steve and others believed would do the job. We believe that a Bolshevik (Trotskyist) party can be built only through struggle against liquidationism and for a rock-hard revolutionary program. Within such a party, rich diversity and conflict will be productive and decisive, in contrast to the flaccid inconclusiveness of the political amalgams favored by Steve. We aim for the same goals with different means; we don’t think his means could or ever will achieve that end.
We not only mourn his death, but we dedicate ourselves to avenge an honest fighter against the criminal social system that killed him. The truest retribution will be the victory of that class, the proletariat, for whom Comrade Steve Zeluck gave his life.

Notes
1. The Role of Statism In the Colonial World and The Character of the State in China.
 



Many black workers today are being won to electoral politics in general and Reverend Jesse Jackson’s campaign in particular. Given present circumstances this is understandable. Reagan’s economic “recovery” only serves to mock the stark reality of omnipresent poverty and unemployment in the ghettoes. What alternative is there to playing the electoral game?
And in racist America, the idea of an obviously sophisticated and charismatic black leader commanding universal attention and running a credible campaign for the highest office in politics is a great source of pride. It is therefore no surprise that ordinary black workers who make no pretense of being class-conscious Marxists are buying Jackson and the strategy of electoralism in the capitalist Democratic Party. But growing numbers of self-proclaimed socialists are doing so as well. Rival leftists are vying with each other in a mad effort to win the fervency prize in support of the Reverend Jackson.
Many of these leftists argue that racism is the key question in the coming election period. They are right. A fight against racism could unlock the class struggle and open the way to black liberation. But a tragically large number have concluded that the war against racism must be initiated through electoralism, Jesse Jackson, and the Democratic Party. This course will have the effect opposite to that intended: it will slam the door to black liberation shut.
The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and the Communist Party (CP) are both reformist outfits which habitually splash around in the Democratic Party swamp. Today they find themselves unable to choose between Jackson and his union bureaucracy-backed opponent Walter Mondale.
What is more distinctive about 1984 is that the more “revolutionary” left, like the Communist Workers Party (CWP), the Workers World Party (WWP), Line of March and the Guardian newspaper are all jumping into the same swamp. And they are joined by many “Marxist-Leninists” and independent radicals in crossing the class line. Once there they will inevitably meet up with older generations of ex-socialistic types like Bayard Rusrin and “Fritz” Mondale himself; for the new road is actually an old and well-worn one-way street.
Does Jackson’s Program Matter?
The Jacksonian left is not supporting their man because of the stellar qualities of his political program. On the contrary, Jackson is so clearly a defender of capitalism that it is no simple task to costume him for the role of hero. Thus the CP simply ignores his pro-capitalist views. The Guardian delicately comments that “his views on a number of issues leave something to be desired.” All agree with the CWP’s Workers Viewpoint, which claimed that opponents of Jackson’s campaign who “grumble over Jackson’s” non-socialist platform miss the point.” The point is that Jackson is supposedly arousing mass movements, notably the black movement. When a hero does that, who can resist?
Michael Harrington, leader of DSA, made it even more explicit in a Convention resolution: “We cannot, of course, approve the programmatic content of Jackson’s past positions which fall far short of what is needed, and sometimes (!) have suggested (!) that there is a ‘black capitalist’ solution to poverty and economic crisis. But we are very much impressed by the movement that is building up behind Jackson as a candidate...”
To round out the picture, Sam Marcy, high potentate of the WWP, pontificates: “Not withstanding the fact that he continually promotes a left-liberal line on most fundamental political questions which does not distinguish him very much from other liberals such as George McGovern, Gary Hart or Alan Cranston, it is very plain that they are all part and parcel of the capitalist establishment which Jackson is running against.” What makes it so evident that Jackson is not part and parcel of this establishment? “The fundamental difference...is that Jackson is leading a movement.”
The left’s arguments on the question of Jackson’s pro-capitalist position can be summed up in two words: ignore it. Only the movement he is initiating is important. Nevertheless, it is instructive to look at what Jackson’s views of his role in the capitalist system and its electoral process actually are – to see precisely where Jackson is leading his followers. Jackson is widely known for his demagogy but is really far more forthright than many left leaders. He has repeatedly made clear that he intends to be a broker for the black masses and others who shelter under his “rainbow coalition.” “A credible campaign,” he said, “would give blacks much-needed bargaining power. Bargainers without bases are beggars, not brokers.” He noted that “the Democratic Party has litmus tests it must pass. It cannot receive investments without promising dividends and returns.”
This program cannot be ignored – because it is the very program that black working people who support Jackson agree with. Indeed, those blacks who support the black politicians in Mondale’s camp have the same outlook; they disagree merely over how to maximize the returns from brokering within the system. To dismiss Jackson’s proclaimed intent on such questions is to dismiss in reality the current views of the black working class.
In our opinion these views – that real gains are possible under present-day capitalism, through the Democratic Party – are very wrong. But they must be contended with. What black workers think is critically important, especially for those who claim to believe that working-class consciousness is the key to the socialist transformation of society.
Another point: historically Marxists have understood why the masses of working people turned to religion for solace from the miseries of daily life. Communists have always tried to collaborate with religious fellow-workers in battles against the exploiters; the two agreed to disagree in order to further the struggle. But the same heritage teaches us the need for an unyielding criticism of organized religious leaders who seek to maintain superstition’s grip on their “flock” and inevitably betray them to the ruling classes. Today’s left utters not a peep about the fundamentalist harangues of the Baptist clergyman, the Reverend Jesse Jackson. They consider themselves too sophisticated for such pap, but they have no quarrel with letting Jackson do the “necessary” dirty work.
Does the Democratic Party Matter?
Central to Jackson’s campaign is the goal of using his mass support among blacks to build the Democratic Party. Thus he has said:
I’m running because there are more people locked out of the Democratic party who are its natural constituents than are locked into it. ... So I’m running to defend the poor and make welcome the outcasts and to deliver those votes that are stuck at the bottom. I think that is the salvation of the Democratic party, the democratic process, and for the soul of America. (New York magazine, January 9.)
Genuine communists know that the Democratic and Republican parties are both capitalist parties, enemies of the working class, black and white. They are panics of racism, unemployment, depression and war. But since the 1920’s when blacks began to switch from “the party of Lincoln,” blacks have had a different estimate of the Democrats. And not without reason.
The Republican Party openly represents big business. The Democrats represent the more liberal bourgeoisie and therefore can claim to reflect the interests of workers and minorities as well. For example, in the 1930’s with the huge explosion of industrial unionism and in the 1960’s with the black upheaval, the Democrats were forced to yield some reforms, lest the mass struggles threaten the capitalist system itself. The Democratic Party was never the source of these popular gains; votes were never the weapon that won them. But the Democratic Party was the channel through which gains won in struggle were grudgingly distributed. And voting power within the party did affect the apportionment of the concessions disbursed.
The price that the black and white masses paid for these benefits was pacification and the incorporation of their struggles. The party machines and the network of bureaucracies and agencies of the welfare state were the byways and mazes that people were forced to traverse in order to get the gains they had won. The Democratic Party has always been an institution designed to divert struggles against the system and divide them up into small sectors so that eventually the system can take away the gains it can no longer afford. Thus the Democratic Party is not a way-station for a movement but a diversion, in fact a graveyard.
As long as black assertiveness is confined to the Democratic Party, there will always be a racist reaction and the blacks will be doomed to lose. The bourgeoisie and its politicians will always favor their white pawns at the expense of blacks. Even in past times of relative prosperity, capitalism denied blacks equality; now it is out of the question. When black politicians make very limited demands for blacks – as in Detroit, Atlanta and Philadelphia – there is no big problem for the moment. But when there are mass mobilizations with real demands, as in Chicago’s election of Mayor Washington last year, no matter how much the Washingtons equivocate there will always be Vrdolyaks available to whip up racist reaction.
The Left and the Democrats
Part of Jackson’s attraction for the left is his “rainbow coalition” idea, a unification of the dispossessed inside the Democratic Party. By pressure of voting strength inside and potential for movement outside the electoral arena it hopes to compel concessions out of the system. But such alliances are traditional within the Democratic Party. Not being class conscious, they are alliances based upon loyalty to a particular sector and aimed at combining divergent class interests within each sector. Under capitalism such pacts always break down, even more readily than do cartels and trusts among the capitalists themselves. If the system can offer one group in the alliance something at the expense of the others, then the deal is off.
When Jesse Jackson invites working-class people into the Democratic Party, when he promises that if you support it you will get a piece of the pie, do the Jacksonian leftists warn against this? Do they point out that tying a movement to the Democrats can only cripple it? No. Not a word. There is not even a hint of the line that might say, “We support Jackson, but the Democratic Party trap will kill his movement.” Even those leftists who think of themselves as too pure to join the Party (yet) believe it vital to begin there. Again, let Jesse do the dirty work.
The DSA, on the other hand, echoes Jackson’s invitation in slightly more leftist terms: “So for now; at least, American social movements have their electoral expression within the Democratic Party. Whether the party will someday be transformed in a more left direction by this activity, or whether progressive forces will have to leave en masse to form a new party, is impossible to foresee. But today the Democratic Party is where the action is.” (Democratic Left, November December 1983.)
Similarly but more nastily, the CWP’s Phil Thompson also invites the unwary into the Democratic Party trap: “The person who stands on the sidewalk with their merry band of ten followers are not revolutionaries. The real revolutionaries are people willing to go into the Democratic Party, the bourgeoisie’s turf, and put their politics out to the millions...” (Workers Viewpoint, December 14.) Yet for all its unwillingness about standing on the sidewalk and all its eagerness to jump into the bourgeois gutter, the CWP is encumbered by its radical past and doesn’t want to get its feet too wet. It still says that “workers, Blacks and other oppressed people in the U.S. will gain nothing if Mondale beats Reagan. We will lose nothing if Reagan beats Mondale.” (Workers Viewpoint, December 21.) In its own terms, the CWP will then be joining us on the “sidewalk.”
However, the CWP is able to talk left like this only because it isn’t ready to admit what the CP, the DSA, Jesse Jackson, most blacks and almost everybody else knows: after Jackson loses the Democratic nomination he will endorse the party candidate, Mondale or some facsimile thereof. And the CWP will very likely follow the logic of its “revolutionary” street-walking and join the more experienced leftists in the Democratic camp – if not this year, then next time.
The DSA will be delighted to be able to endorse “labor’s candidate.” After all, Harrington still justifies his support to Lyndon Johnson in 1964 with the “vote for Johnson to stop Goldwater and prevent a war in Vietnam” line. Now as then, the social democrats find it useful to fib a little about their candidate. Harrington delicately put it in his Convention report, “Like all the other announced candidates, Mondale’s program leaves much to be desired (!) and does not address (!) the urgency of democratizing basic investment decisions.” That’s why Marxists call the capitalists the ruling class, Mike, remember? According to another DSA Convention report, “At the center of the Democratic Party is Walter Mondale and his ‘corporatist’ proposals to bring business, labor and the state together in a ‘new social contract’... Mondale certainly has more than a little of the Cold Warrior in him...” More than a little indeed, but this will prove no hindrance to DSA’s endorsement.
The CP’s Daily World has been promoting Jackson. If, it hasn’t actually endorsed him that’s because it too has friends in the labor bureaucracy who are committed to Mondale. Since Mondale is more than a little bit of a Cold Warrior, the Daily World criticizes him a little bit but not more. After all, the CP’s main theme is “Dump Reagan.” Reagan, not capitalism, is the source of problems like war, unemployment, racism, etc., a line well calculated to convince anyone who never heard of Jimmy Carter or Lyndon Johnson. Of course,  when the CP backs the Democrats against Reagan it will be done in vintage Stalinist style: the CP will run its own candidates who will speak boldly for stopping Reagan above all,  i.e. for voting Democratic.
The Workers World Party may follow the same tack, and it too has its own “anti-Reagan” candidates ready. But given its Trotskyist origins (well hidden and well past), the WWP tries a little harder to maintain an independent stance. But not much, it too has constantly identified Reagan as the source of capitalism’s evils; and even if it hesitates to call openly for a vote for Any Democrat, its periphery will have been trained to do exactly that. 
What about a Third Party?
The WWP has one difference with the CP: it has announced that it will support Jackson and withdraw its own candidates is he runs a third-party campaign. Another outfit with the same line is the New Alliance Party, which specializes in denouncing the Democratic Party while working actively inside it. Thus it backs Jackson inside while running its own candidate outside: “It’s what we call an insurance policy in case Jesse doesn’t get picked by the Democrats and some folks in the Rainbow Coalition seek to deliver the Rainbow’s clout to the Democratic Party bosses.” (National Alliance, February 20) This “policy” overlooks the evident fact that one of the “folks” planning a deal with the party bosses is Jesse himself.
As already noted, Jackson is clearly not going to run independently. What he will do is make the mildest possible bargaining statements to warn the Democrats not to take blacks for granted. He did this last time around, trying to threaten Jimmy Carter that “the idea that blacks won’t vote for a Republican is inaccurate.” (New York Times, July 22, 1980) 
No one took him seriously then, and now that he is heavily involved in the electoral game he is taking even fewer chances. This time he said, “I have absolutely no fear of blacks being so destabilized by the possibility of a loss at one level that they will not be able to adjust to the reality of the general election.” (New York Times, November 2, 1983.) As well, “I’m inclined to expand the party, not break with the party.” (New York January 9.) He is promising that he and his base are loyal and safe.
In fact, Jackson’s loyalty pledges have gone so far as to draw Sam Marcy’s criticism – but not of Jackson. “It is all well and good for certain leftists who are looking for an excuse not to support Jackson to avail themselves of his many utterances about how we are all one party, we are all Democrats, we are for unity, and so on and so forth. But this kind of jargon is part of the form of struggle. Whether it is of good coin or not matters little. It is the objective dynamics of the struggle which are decisive.” (Workers World, February 2.)
Yes, the struggle is what matters. But Jackson’s words, and those of all his leading lieutenants and followers, influence the struggle. Black workers are not cattle, driven by cowboy leaders or simply by elemental forces. They take their politics seriously, and when someone who presently commands their allegiance urges them to be loyal Democrats this has its effect. Socialists concerned about workers’ views would decry what Jackson says and argue against him. Whereas Marcy and the rest who ignore Jackson’s message in favor of other “objective dynamics” are demonstrating only their contempt for the masses.
The leftist tendencies that oppose support for Democrats and therefore for Jackson are relatively few. In words they are more radical than the Jacksonian left, but there is no fundamental difference in terms of class. Their objections to Jackson are programmatic and personal; they do not see the criterion as class against class. If they apply the term “middle class” to Jackson it is simply a statement of hostility or description rather than of whose interests he represents.
In reality their approach is sectoral. Since all blacks are oppressed in the U.S., these leftists choose to overlook class differences among blacks. They oppose the Democratic Party because it is a particular institution of evil, not because it is an instrument of the capitalist class. In other words, Jackson’s main problem is that he is running as a Democrat. If he had the same constellation of class forces outside the party, they would support him or someone like him.
Consider the International Socialists (IS), which calls for Jackson to run independently. (No surprise: an IS minority wanted to endorse Democrat Harold Washington in Chicago.) Thus two IS leaders write in the March 7 Guardian:
We believe Jesse Jackson would be most responsive to the real, immediate and historic needs and to the mass sentiments of his base if he ran for President as an independent. And we believe activists should advocate that he do this ...
They go on to add that his present campaign “represents an historic opportunity tragically wasted because it remains locked within the Democratic Party.”
The Revolutionary Socialist League once split from the IS and had a brief honeymoon with revolutionary class politics before receding back. Now it is virtually indistinguishable from its forebears. Like the IS, it rejects Jackson as a Democrat but likes him as an independent:
If Jackson were to lead a third, independent party campaign based upon the publicity and organization built up through the Democratic primaries, such a campaign would have the potential to generate a movement combining electoral action with other forms of protest. Such a campaign could develop into an alliance of Black people, Latins, women, gays, workers and progressive groups that would deserve serious consideration regardless of its formal label or Jackson’s own reformist politics. (Torch, February 15.)
The IS also supports Jackson as the leader of a list of groupings not different from the RSL’s. For both, workers are just one constituency like any other. A Jackson-led third party would not in their eyes (or in reality) be a working-class party, not even a black workers’ party. Like Jackson and the Jacksonian left, they too accept the idea of a coalition of sectors instead. So they favor a third capitalist party today. Their customary calls for a reformist party (like the British Labour Party) are cast into the far future along with the even more impractical idea of revolutionary socialism.
A third capitalist party led by petty-bourgeois elements is no “realistic” step toward class independence; it is an attempt to head off class consciousness when the looming social explosion occurs. Black workers have never bought a third party despite the attempts of many radicals to launch one. Coalitions – that is, pacts among sectors to broker the system – have to come to grips with power. Third parties, especially non-existent ones which accept capitalism, have all of the problems of the Democratic Party plus a lot of rhetorical demands which everyone knows are utopian. What they don’t have is the Democratic Party’s power, its seeming ability to deliver gains. Who needs them? The left “third party” groups are sending the message that Jackson in the Democratic Party is more serious than they are. And that is correct.
In contrast to the CWP, WWP and NAP, the IS-RSL wing understands that Jackson doesn’t want to run independently. But the latter groups would have a difficult time opposing Jackson the Democrat if he did try an independent course after losing the primaries. The RSL already appreciates that the “publicity and organization built up through the Democratic primaries” would be essential. The difference between them and the Jacksonians is not a question of class, only of time.
Another group, Workers Power, is equally committed to sectoral coalitions externally, and it in addition is a coalition itself internally. It can rarely agree on a course of action. While it opposes Jackson with some effective arguments, it is anyone’s guess what the group thinks the alternative should be.
The Socialist Workers Party, on the other hand, knows its course very well and is in the process of jettisoning even the minute Trotskyist pretensions that it retains. The SWP opposes Jackson but (like the WWP) has stated that it will support him and withdraw its own candidates if he runs as the head of an independent black party. The SWP regards blacks as fundamentally working-class and therefore defines any black party as proletarian. Thus its differences with black misleaderships always take a moralistic form: they are good outside the Democratic Party but bad inside. Without a class analysis it has trouble distinguishing itself not only from a non-existent third party but also from the Democrats. It has learned to run its own candidates for office in order to avoid the political logic which would put it among the Democratic liberals. The Guardian, which has fewer hesitations about naked bourgeois campaigns, has pointedly mocked the SWP for its sectarianism in this regard, running candidates against Washington in Chicago and Mel King in Boston without anything much different to propose – and netting less than a negligible total of votes as a reward.
Left Lacks Class Analysis
Then there is the Spartacist League, whose idea of revolutionary politics is to substitute ultra-radical rhetoric and abrasive image-making for any understanding of class struggle. While the CP and the WWP use their “independent” candidacies as covers for the line that Reagan, not capitalism, is the enemy, the SL does something similar. The fine print in its press blames capitalism, while the headlines scream that “Reagan is War Crazy!” – and paint him as a maniac out of control. If taken seriously, this language only suggests to readers that they had better run out and vote for anyone rather than this madman who is liable to push the button any moment for no rational reason at all. The Democrats could ask for no more backhanded support than that. But in reality Reagan reflects only one version of U.S. ruling class interests. His politics, as well as the liberal Democrats’, will lead to war, racism and misery not out of personal craziness but out of the needs of capitalism.
Jackson too is pictured as an evil hustler. Beyond an epithet or so, his relation to petty-bourgeois class interests as opposed to the workers’ is ignored. This becomes clear when the SL discusses why it opposes any Jackson-led third party: it is not a question of class but of sufficient radicalness. The SL still boasts of its past electoral support: “when the Panthers ran Huey Newton, Bobby Seale and Kathleen Cleaver as candidates in the 1968 California elections, the SL called for votes to them (but not to their running mates of the petty-bourgeois Peace and Freedom Party).” (Workers Vanguard, December 10.)
True enough, Newton, Scale and the Cleavers were more radical than Jackson but hardly more working-class. The Black Panther Party combined radical middle-class and student elements wedded to an openly lumpenproletarian outlook. But the giveaway is the SL’s distinction between the BPP leaders who ran on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket and the PFP itself, whom the SL calls petty-bourgeois. The two groups were in alliance because both were petty bourgeois. The SL’s inability to call the Panthers either middle-class or working-class shows that it, like the rest of the left, does not discern real class differences among blacks. 
Jackson’s Underlying Strategy
James W. Compton is executive director of the Chicago Urban League and a leading Jackson supporter. Six years ago he observed, pointing accurately to the conditions facing blacks in the United States: “Our large cities are in much the state they were in 1965 when the poor of Watts put the torch to the most accessible symbols of their disadvantage.” He added, “Without genuine relief the urban poor can reasonably be expected to rise again.” But this time he foresaw that they will rise “against class as well as against race, with blacks of moderate achievement and their property among the most ready victims.” (New York Times, February 13, 1978.)
As Compton foresaw, the black masses saw that the real and illusory gains made in the past were blowing away by the late 1970’s, and there were riots in several cities. But where the earlier riots like the one in Watts had struck fear into the ruling class and forced benefits out of the government, now capitalism in crisis would not yield what blacks “of moderate achievement and...property” were pleading for to stave off the upheaval.
On the contrary, the repressive forces of the state tightened their grip on the ghetto, and unemployment and poverty shot up. The press, black as well as white, carried story after story about the hostility toward the middle-class black leadership that abounded in the ghettoes. Andrew Young and Jesse Jackson were booed in Miami. Shortly after the riots there one resident commented, "Black people can forget about all that leadership stuff. Black leaders do a lot of talking. But that’s all they do  talk.” (New York Times, June 29, 1980.)
The black leaders could offer no way out except to begin their campaign for voter registration and passive electoral activity. Seeing no other alternative to the failure of violent explosion to produce gains, many blacks followed their misleaders into the Democratic Party they had come to despise. This is the part of Jackson’s underlying strategy that is not talked about so publicly: to divert any future black explosion into safe electoralist channels.
Contrary to the left, it is not Jackson who will build a movement of the black masses. Gimmicks and heroes do not create movements. Leaders may point the way, may take command, for better or for worse, or may even derail them. But Marxists, as opposed to leftists and other middle-class political operators, know that it is the system and its contradictions that forces people into motion. The black upheaval is inevitable because capitalism continues to grind people down. Jackson’s campaign and the electoral registration drive accompanying it are preventative measures designed to defuse such a movement, not build it. A vote for Jackson is a vote against a black upheaval. Likewise, so is a vote for any of the other Democrats supported by Jackson’s black political rivals. 
Jackson approaches the Democratic Party in order to get it to open its doors further to incorporate the black masses. He wants to reform, not overthrow it; his challenge should be seen, according to him, “not as a threat but as therapy.” (Washington Post Weekly Edition, December 19, 1983.)
The party still retains vestiges of its past appeal when it was thought of as the deliverer of benefits for the working people. It was this very capital gained in the past that enabled the Democrat Carter to demand austerity from the masses to restore capitalist profits. It is no accident that Democratic governors and mayors (the growing number of blacks among the latter included) preach the same message. Likewise, it was no accident that mass anti-war movements throughout the century have attracted Democratic politicians with their pledges of peace – and it was equally inevitable that Democratic presidents used this capital to lead the U.S. into World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Bay of Pigs invasion, the invasion of the Dominican Republic and the Vietnam War.
Traditionally, the Democratic Party has tolerated representatives of various ethnic groups, unions, blacks, Hispanics, women, reformers, environmentalists and all others who form its voting base. These brokers bargained and fought with each other for pieces of the pie that the bourgeoisie was forced by mass action to place on the table. The petty-bourgeois brokers and the institutions they were tied to got the largest share. Small favors, small jobs, small concessions but a lot of hope were doled out to the constituents of each sector.
When times were good for American imperialism, especially during the postwar prosperity bubble, there were enough sops to satisfy the brokers and even some of their working-class constituencies. They took the form of welfare-state measures like social security and unemployment insurance as well as business contracts, industry subsidies, government jobs and the like. But today capitalism is caught in a profound economic crisis that is pushing it toward a new great depression despite momentary and shallow recoveries. The pie is shrinking, especially in those sectors that tend to benefit blacks who are shoved to the bottom of the ladder: blacks are disproportionately dependent on government jobs and welfare-state support. The situation is grim – and only beginning.
Carter could not sell his austerity policy, at least not enough to stabilize capitalism, which needs to squeeze far more out of the workers if it is to emerge from its crisis. Carter tried escalating the Cold War in part to justify sacrifices by the American people. His failure produced Reagan, who has tried harder on both counts. If Reagan’s failure in turn becomes evident before the election we will see another austerity-liberal regime under one Mondale or another. Jackson’s argument that black voices providing the margin of the Republicans’ defeat will increase black brokerage gains was already disproved by Carter, who beat Gerald Ford in 1976 by virtue of the black vote.
But one thing is clear in any case. The increasing devastation of blacks, together with their strategic position as workers in hard-hit but crucial industries and services in major cities, means that the system and the Democratic Party need more black faces to preside over austerity. 
The Black Politicians
The black politicians, who reflect the varied interests of the small but socially significant black middle class, are eager to play this role. The numbers of black elected officials are growing (5606 in 1983, an 8.6 percent increase over 1982). Jackson’s description of them as “brokers” is exactly on target. In 1891 Friedrich Engels noted the same phenomenon:
Nowhere do the ‘politicians’ form a more distinct and powerful subdivision of the nation than in North America. There both of the two great parties, which alternately succeed each other in power, are themselves in turn ruled by people who make a business of politics, who speculate on seats in the legislative assemblies of the Union as well as of the separate states, or who live by spreading propaganda for their party and are awarded with offices after its victory. (Introduction to Karl Marx’s The Civil War in France.)
This description still fits American politicians, including the blacks. In a previous article (Socialist Voice No. 20) we trace the different bases within the black middle class and among politicians that are represented by Jackson on the one hand and his rivals for black leadership on the other. The two wing see the world alike. They have a common stake in the system and in preventing social upheaval. But they are tied to the black masses because American capitalism, racist to the core, will never let them escape this identity. The power of the politicians in fact stems from their brokering for the black masses; without this they would be of no use to the whit bourgeoisie.
Given the fact that the black bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeois property owning sectors are tiny, the ties of the black middle layers to capitalism are general rather that particular. Naturally the black politicians seek to reinvigorate the poverty programs of the 1960’s and early 1970’s. That is hardly possible today, but the politicians are still primarily oriented toward the state sector. So they preside over austerity for the masses, over stricter police enforcement, over contraction of the “social wage” in the form of education transportation and other government services in the cities. The masses’ vicarious racial identification with these leaders is used to keep a lid on rebelliousness. This is the true social program of the black middle class and its political leadership Jesse Jackson included. 
Operation PUSH
Thus Jackson’s well-publicized Operation PUSH (People United to Serve Humanity) criticized big corporations like Coca-Cola for not giving contracts and franchises to black small businessmen and for not hiring black workers – and succeeded in winning such contracts and franchises, but few jobs. Far more insidiously, PUSH spreads propaganda among black youth that if they study and work hard they can “make it” under capitalism. This “pull yourself up by your own bootstraps” line really means that blacks have only themselves to blame if they don’t succeed. But it is capitalism, not a lack of trying, that creates the over 50 percent unemployment of black youth. Pushing may get a job for you instead of the next person, but it can’t increase the total available.
Jesse Jackson also has stood for one of the favorite programs of the Reagan right, the sub-minimum wage for youth Recent studies show what Marxists (and, indeed, dedicated trade unionists) have known for decades: this only means a general lowering of wages. If there is any additional hiring of youth, under all foreseeable conditions this will mean white youth.
PUSH’s attitude toward workers and unions in Chicago, its home base, is, instructive. For example, it acted as strikebreaker in the recent strike by the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) and the Coalition of School Employees Unions. It sought a court injunction to force the CTU workers (who are 55 percent black) back to work. PUSH was particularly vehement during this strike, since it considered it an attack on black prerogatives now that Harold Washington was in power as Chicago’s mayor.
Jackson represents an attempt to pull together a multi-class (not just multi-racial, as “rainbow” implies) coalition for political office, an embryonic popular front. Like all other class collaborationist arrangements, it necessarily sacrifices the workers’ interests for those of the upper layers. It is no accident that the welfare of black politicians in Chicago was seen as coinciding with the continuation of the capitalist cutback and austerity program.
Recently a Chicago resident sent a pointed letter to the Guardian which correctly accused the paper of “refusing to even report the attacks of Harold Washington on labor, especially public sector workers, many of whom are black, Hispanic or female.” The letter quoted Washington’s chief labor negotiator, Richard Laner, whose comments had appeared in the Chicago Tribune:
There’s been a long history in the public sector that one has a job for life and will get a raise every year. But the economy has changed all that. The mayor wants to increase productivity as if this was a private company, watch the dollar and ride tough and hard. The unions, in my view, haven’t accepted that.
This is the social program of austerity for the workers supported by the supposedly “working-class left” in the U.S. today!
Jacksonism in Action
How Jesse Jackson will play the Democratic Party game isn’t mere speculation. There are concrete examples. One of his strongest supporters urging him to run for the presidency was Bobby Jackson, head of the Jersey City, New Jersey, city council. Bobby Jackson is now a state coordinator of Jesse Jackson’s campaign. In 1981 he was a running-mate of Mayor Gerry McCann and since then has been the mayor’s strongest ally among blacks in the council. Likewise Operation PUSH, in which Bobby Jackson is active, not only supported McCann in the election but continued to be his firm ally.
Mayor McCann is a confirmed Reaganite, the head of Hudson (County). Democrats for Reagan in 1980, who maintains warm relations with the administration, especially its notorious Secretary of Labor, Ray Donovan. He was offered a sub-cabinet post but chose to run for mayor again. During his tenure he has tried to crush rent control, and has so far succeeded in gaining significant exemptions from it; he has raised local taxes 30 percent in two years, and has openly favored chasing the poorest people (mostly black and Hispanic) out of the city.
The political columnist of the Jersey Journal wrote on August 10, 1983:
Council President Bobby Jackson’s relationship with McCann remains a puzzle to many, but for now it appears to be mutually-beneficial. Jackson has been able to secure prominent positions in municipal government for blacks, while McCann has been able to deflect some criticism of his generally conservative administration through Jackson and his allies.
Jersey City politics are not basically different from other cities’ run by the Democratic party, just more naked. It all means essentially a few positions for black politicians at the expense of the black masses.
The Bobby Jackson-McCann coalition may well break down; such is the nature of coalitions. But it won’t be over principle or out of sudden concern for black-Hispanic unity among the working people. Nor will it be out of a sudden heartfelt concern for the anger of black and Latin politicians in New York City that Jersey City is using federal funding to snatch jobs from blacks and Hispanics across the Hudson River in New York. No, it is just the Democratic war of all against all; the rainbow coalition can’t even span the Hudson. 
Jackson’s Foreign Policy
Jesse Jackson’s role as the left face of capitalism, struggling to maintain the system by reforming it to allow potential rebels to get a little piece of the action, is true abroad as well as at home. Take his visit to South Africa in 1979. The apartheid regime gave him permission to come when he assured it, in familiar terms, that his trip should be seen “as a therapy and not as a threat” (New York Times, July 24, 1979).
Oppression, however, demands destruction, not therapeutics. Young South African black power militants denounced him for associating with the racist regime’s token black leaders. He was also denounced for praising government minister Pieter Koornhof, the “liberal” face of apartheid, as a “courageous man” and one “for whom he had high regard” (New York Times, August 2, 1979). His attempt to patch up apartheid by endorsing its more liberal facade earned him the title of “a diabolical Western agent” from one militant. Would that the American left could speak the truth so well.
More recent was his renowned trip to Syria to rescue U.S. Lieutenant Robert Goodman, captured after a bombing flight over Lebanon. The aim of Jackson’s mission was to promote a deal between U.S. imperialism and the Syrian rulers to carve up influence over Lebanon peacefully. Jackson, like some other Democrats, understood that the American forces could not succeed in stabilizing Lebanon as open supporters of the neo-fascist, minority Gemayel regime. A few months ago, however, he still favored the U.S. presence there; now he prefers a United Nations contingent, as a cover, to maintain the imperialist presence and keep the Lebanese masses down. The one thing Jackson did not do was use his highly publicized expedition to criticize U.S. or Israeli imperialism.
Quite the contrary. Jackson told the press that “the Arab war against Israel must be stopped,” (New York Times, January 6) whereas it is Israel that continues to be the aggressor in the war to crush the Palestinian people. Jackson had gained a reputation for being pro-Arab because of his wish for the U.S. to hold talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization. The racist anti-Arab media still attack Jackson and PUSH for accepting donations from Arab sources. But Jackson is not supporting the Arab masses; he is simply agreeing with a section of the American bourgeoisie that wants Washington to have ties with reactionary Arab regimes as well as with Israel.
Jackson’s attitude on the Middle East was aptly rebuked by a spokesman for the moderate American-Arab Relations Committee, whose president stated that Jackson’s pronouncements showed “utmost contempt for the feelings of the Arab people.” He added, “You are a disappointment, brother.”
Jackson’s actual pro-imperialist position does not stop the Daily World, Workers World, the Guardian, and Workers Viewpoint from hailing their hero’s “peace mission” to Damascus, his support for the Arab people, his fight against imperialism. They are equally glowing about his supposed anti-imperialist policies toward Central America. Yet Jackson himself has been more than explicit about the real nature of his position. It is designed to be the best possible defense of the imperialist system. During the Democratic Party debate in New Hampshire, Jackson urged that: “We should be in a state of readiness now. Some things are worth fighting for. Honduras and Lebanon are not worth it, but the Persian Gulf is worth it. The industrial base of the Western world is at stake.”
But of course the left understands Jackson better than Jackson does. Irwin Silber asserts in his paper Frontline (January 23), “Whether he is completely aware of the fact or not, Jackson is the political representative of that section of the working class and laboring masses with the least basis to support imperialist policy.” Thus does the left again offer itself as a cover for the liberal wing of imperialism.
The “Hymie” Affair
As of this writing it has been some time since Jackson, after a two-week delay, confessed to and apologized for his now-famous chauvinist remarks about Jews as “Hymies” and New York as “Hymietown.” Most of the Jacksonian left has moved with equal slowness to comment. So far only the Guardian has taken a clear-cut position objecting to Jackson’s remarks. It believes Jackson’s stance to be “counterproductive” to what still is “the most promising vehicle at present for building an independent progressive political movement” (March 17).
It concludes that “someone in Jackson’s position ought to take the lead in showing that being anti-Zionist is not the same thing as being anti-Jewish. He hasn’t done this. And he has undermined his principled Mideast position by not doing so.” The Guardian, of course, has every right to sympathize with Jackson’s “principled” position, which it agrees with and therefore falsely qualifies as “anti-Zionist.” But it is correct in noting Jackson’s difficulty in distinguishing Zionism from Judaism. Still, the Guardian cannot point out the fundamental source of Jackson’s statements, since like the rest of the left and all of the Zionists it holds a nationalist, class collaborationist perspective rather than a working class one.
The Zionists have indeed harassed Jesse Jackson, complaining bitterly about his Mideast position. It is noteworthy, however, that Zionist organizations were far more gentle m treating John Connally, a conservative white contender for the Republican nomination in 1980, who held a similar position to Jackson’s on Israel and the Palestinians. Likewise, the level of bile directed against George McGovern’s candidacy is far less, and he too reflects a similar trend in U.S. bourgeois opinion.
The Jewish leaders are quarreling with Jackson because he represents an attempt to broker a larger share of the diminishing pie. As the last ones in on the take, their own position of acceptance in American capitalism is still precarious. They have been fighting black leaders of various stripes for years over quotas, affirmative action and the like. This quarrel has achieved notoriety as “The Crisis in Black and Jewish Relations.” It naturally focuses inside the Democratic Party, capitalism’s major agency for deepening social divisions. The newly arrived Jewish politicians like New York mayor Koch fight off the demands of the later-arriving blacks. The Jackson candidacy, demanding a major new division of the pie, is seen as a threat not only to the Jewish leaders but also to their historic allies among party apparatchiks and labor officials, especially because of the power of the black working class.
American Zionism is not only a reactionary pro-Israel nationalism but also a specific adaptation to U.S. capitalism. It is a central aspect of the ethnic ideology purveyed by the Jewish bourgeoisie to break the once-powerful working-class identification among the Jewish masses. Even today, as the more affluent Jews become more reactionary, there is still a strong progressive potential among white collar working-class Jews. Sectoral identity at the expense of class consciousness is maintained through demagogy on the “Arab threat” and increasingly the “black threat” as well.
Jackson thinks the same way, in reverse. When he sought to apologize for his “Hymie” remarks, he cited the hostility of an interviewer named Cohen against his daughter, who was applying for entrance to Harvard (symbolically enough). For Jackson the problem was not just the Zionists, but the Cohens, the Jews – just as the Jewish bourgeoisie sees the problem as the blacks.
It is important to note that Jackson was not attempting to whip up the black masses against Jews. That could only backfire now in racist America. The entrenched Jewish leadership has somewhat more leverage to heighten Jewish hostility toward blacks. And when the situation gets worse economically and socially, the fight will become more naked.
If the black proletariat allows its middle-class leadership to take it along the same course in the Democratic Party as the Jewish leaders have gone, the results will be disastrous. What is necessary is an end to sectoral coalitions inevitably based on the class outlook of the upper strata, and a turn to class consciousness. But the left also sees sectoralism as paramount; it too is mired in its networks, coalitions, and pacts which will inevitably break down. This can only fuel fratricidal warfare between sections of the working class.
Jackson’s thoughts on “Hymies” were par for the course for bourgeois politicians. For the left to cover, equivocate and apologize for such garbage on the part of the man they put forward as the hero of the oppressed is a new level of degeneration, just a foretaste of what these social cretins have in store. 
The Left vs. Marxism
In the last analysis, the reason the “socialists” support the austerity-minded black middle-class leaders is that they themselves reflect a radical section of the same layer, the same intelligentsia. The cynical contempt all of these people have for the workers is enormous. The existence of the radical left in the working class, and especially its middle-class aristocracy, is a world-wide phenomenon.
Much of the left rhetorically hails “the masses,” “the people,” “the rank and file,” “the movements.” They are constantly putting forward minimal liberal or “anti-Reagan” programs for these movements and masses. They inevitably presume that you have to water down your own nominal program (that is, not raise openly socialist or revolutionary ideas) to “spark,” “arouse,” “galvanize,” “electrify” or “generate” mass movements. Therefore they have an easy unconcern at best or an apology in practice for Jackson’s pro-capitalist program and actions, since that is what’s necessary to create a movement.
That is why so many far-left outfits that began work in the unions in the early 1970’s with salutes to the rank and file and tried to devise “rank and file programs” have since wound up in the laps of left-talking labor officials. That is why so many far-left groups who prate about movements and try to devise minimal (always capitalist) programs to ignite them end up serving as lap-dogs for liberal politicians whose goal is to contain any movement, not stimulate it.
The middle-class left has patently opportunist politics, but its remaining qualms about working inside the Democratic Party are purely sectarian and will soon disappear. After all, once you accept that “galvanizing” a movement requires tailing what you consider the present level of consciousness, you accept the Democrats. That is why those leftists who deem themselves too good to actually dip into the swamp allow Jesse to do the dirty work for them. They will soon learn that they have to plunge in themselves.
The notion that liberal campaigns like Jesse Jackson’s are steps toward socialism is nothing new. Part of the historic difference between reformism and Marxism rested on this question. Reformists tend to see liberal capitalists as creeping socialists who press for a slow, progressive transformation of society even if they personally don’t see going, all the way. Marxists, in contrast, view liberals as defenders of the capitalist system who go along with just enough reforms to forestall socialist consciousness and revolution.
But workers can’t be led to socialism like an animal led to a trap with little pieces of bait along the way. They will reject the Democratic Party and capitalism in general when their hope in these institutions is exhausted and when they recognize their own class power through mass struggle. Then all things become possible that seem absurd today. That is why Marxists use election periods, when all eyes are turned to politics, to show that elections can’t change the system – only class action can. For this reason we argue for the general strike to unite the working class in struggle. 
What Kind of Black Leadership?
The key to opening up the class struggle is indeed the question of race and racism, as the reformist left asserts. Proletarian leadership is impossible without the participation of black workers far out of proportion to their numbers in the general population. As a result of history blacks generally have a higher level of combativity than white workers; they have a far higher level of anti-capitalist consciousness; and black workers are located in the most strategic industries in the major cities of the country.
In strikes throughout the 1970’s white workers began to follow blacks who fought militantly. The prejudices of the ages were subordinated to the common class goal in practice. By following this direction, by fighting in each of the upcoming class battles for the general strike, the way can be paved to a true rainbow that can reach its goal. This means the black leadership that the working class needs.
Instead blacks are offered another kind of leadership, a peace offering to capitalism rather than a new generation of struggle. That is why the issue of working-class independence from capitalism in all its shapes must be posed starkly for black workers in this election campaign. If blacks continue to follow middle-class leadership they will remain trapped in the deadly embrace of capitalism, with its pervasive diseases of racism, depression and war. It is time for black workers to take the lead both in the black liberation struggle and the class struggle necessary to achieve it. That means the working for the proletarian socialist revolution through the struggle for a proletarian revolutionary party. There is no other hope for the working class, black and white.



Now that Jesse Jackson is out of the central media spotlight, the controversy over Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan’s remarks about Jews has ebbed. But only for the moment: Farrakhan is not just a media creation invented to harass an unconventional black candidate. Both he and the issues he has become associated with are here to stay.
The demands on Jackson to repudiate Farrakhan for his anti-Semitism were hypocritical in the extreme. The same critics did not demand that Walter Mondale repudiate friends like Ed Vrdolyak, the openly racist machine pol in Chicago, or Ed Koch, the less open but equally racist mayor of New York. Nor have they suggested that Mondale dissociate himself from those Jewish groups supporting him that regularly spew out anti-Arab caricatures, or that Ronald Reagan break from innumerable racist Republican supporters.
For that matter, they haven’t asked Jackson or Geraldine Ferraro to denounce segregationist George Wallace, to whom both made pilgrimages during their campaigns. And the Senate’s 95 to 0 vote condemning Farrakhan as a bigot was an abomination, coming from a body that has nothing to say about the bigots within it and never saw fit to condemn the Ku Klux Klan and similar white racist outfits.
It is true both that the attacks on Farrakhan (and through him, on Jackson) were racist, and that Farrakhan made anti-white and anti-Semitic comments. But the two cannot be equated: there is an essential difference between the racism of the oppressors and that of the oppressed. The view of many German Jews that the whole German people was responsible for Hitlerism was wrong, racist and disastrous for their resistance – but it was hardly equivalent to the Nazi crimes. Racism in America leads to mass violence against Blacks, whereas Farrakhan represents a dangerous ideology capable only of irreparably harming the struggle against racism. 
Farrakhan Vs. Hitler
The uproar over Farrakhan started when he was accused of being an admirer of Hitler. He is, but in a specific sense. For example, he said that Hitler was not just “great” but “wickedly great.” He admired not Hitler’s massacre of the Jews, despite the Zionist smears, but rather his nationalism. He may aim to become a true Hitler in the future – his views favoring the most retrograde forms of capitalism, the subjection of women and the oppression of gays are already reactionary enough – but that’s not what he is saying now.
Here the Jews don’t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that’s a good name. Hitler was a very great man. He wasn’t great for me as a black person, but he was a great German. Now I’m not proud of Hitler’s evil against Jewish people, but that’s a matter of record. He rose Germany up from nothing. Well, in a sense you could say there’s similarity in that we are rising our people up from nothing. But don’t compare me with your wicked Hitlers.
Nationalists think alike: the problems of their people can be solved by building a great nation. This is why Farrakhan admires Hitler. He sees Blacks as an emerging nation with their own emerging religion of Islam – a totality that includes all Blacks except “traitors.” So too he sees Jews as a totality: Judaism = Zionism = Jewishness. This parallelism does not of course mean that rival nationalists like each other. Each is out for his own nation within the existing world of capitalist imperialism and its unceasing war of all against all. Different nations and nationalists make alliances and break them; each is for his own at the expense of all others. Farrakhan puts it in religious terms:
This I want the Jews to know and we want the world to know: that they are not the chosen people of God. ... What will you do today when the lie is uncovered and we show the world that we are the chosen people of that promise? We are the people who have no land that we can call our own. ... We are the chosen people of God and can back it up. We are ready to do battle with you wherever you come from in the earth. It is the black people in America that is the chosen people of Almighty God.
There are apologists (including socialist ones) who insist that Farrakhan is simply anti-Zionist – opposed to the racially exclusive state of Israel – but not anti-Jewish. The Socialist Workers Party’s Militant (July 13) asserted that the charge of anti-Semitism “is a lie from start to finish.” But it had to admit that there was something a mite off the mark in Farrakhan’s reference to Judaism as a “gutter” (or “dirty”) religion, that while he attacks Zionism “he incorrectly equates those who adhere to the Jewish religion with Zionism.” Exactly: if he’s anti-Zionist but defines all religious Jews as Zionist, then he’s anti-Jewish. Likewise, when he singles out Judaism as a “gutter religion” while not attacking other religions, he is again anti-Jewish. The SWP notes that Farrakhan’s “mistake” in equating Judaism with Zionism is the same as the Zionists’ denouncing all critics of Israel as anti-Semites. Very true, but to show that Farrakhan uses the same nationalist logic that Zionists do is hardly a defense.
The Workers World Party also eulogizes Farrakhan. It not only campaigned for Jesse Jackson but also wanted to see his alliance with Farrakhan maintained. As for the “dirty religion” matter, Workers World demurred: “Unfortunately, this attack on an individual religion is incorrect and could well be taken as anti-Semitic.” Indeed it could, but we are not told how the WWP takes it. The SWP and WWP’s diplomatic delicacy in defense of chauvinism against Jews is really a demonstration of their patronizing attitude towards Blacks. Like the claim that Farrakhan is engaged in a sort of national-religious overstatement or “hyperbole,” it is contemptuous of the Black audience Farrakhan is trying to mislead.
Farrakhan Vs. Malcom X
To see this clearly one only has to read Malcolm X, who, even when he was a firm Black nationalist, characteristically aimed at clear, concrete explanations illustrated by sharp examples and metaphors. He sought to inform an audience he respected; he said what he meant and he meant what he said. Perhaps that helped lead him away from nationalism and its mystifications.
In any case, Farrakhan detested Malcolm so much that he contributed to the atmosphere of murderous threats that led to Malcolm’s assassination. (Farrakhan was hardly being hyperbolic when he wished Malcolm dead.) Of course, Malcolm’s clarity came from his politics. For one thing, he fully understood that Blacks’ reliance on the racist Democratic Party was a disaster – unlike Farrakhan and Jackson.
Farrakhan’s particular nationalist views are important even though Blacks in the U.S. are not a nation. The persistence of nationalism as an ideology shows that it reflects aspects of reality among American Blacks, just as does the persistence of assimilationism. Blacks constitute a specific caste in American society, placed in a contradictory position. Periodically the promise of equality and acceptance is dangled before them, but it is always obvious under the surface (and especially during crises) that capitalist America cannot allow true equality or integration. Out of this contradiction spring both integrationism and nationalism as different ways of fighting to survive.
Farrakhan’s rhetoric talks of creating a separate Black economy. He is a vigorous advocate of “free enterprise” and the hiring of Black labor by Black businesses. The fact that Black workers today are overwhelmingly exploited by the dominant white capitalists, while only a few work for the tiny Black bourgeoisie, determines that Farrakhan’s ostensible goal is to create a nation with an organic relation between its bourgeoisie and proletariat. 
Nationalism AND Integrationism
Despite their difference, Farrakhan’s friendship with Jesse Jackson and Operation PUSH is built upon a common social conservatism and business orientation. PUSH pushes to enlarge the realm of Black business by getting more and better franchises from white-owned corporations. It accepts the present corporate domination as a fact of life. Like Elijah Mohammed and Marcus Garyey before him, Farrakhan tries to develop a network of Black businesses in present-day America more independent than those visualized by the integrationists; his talk of a separate Black nation and economy in the future serves to attract Black masses yearning for solidarity today. Farrakhan the nationalist admired Jackson the integrationist not only for his pro-business leanings but also for bringing the growing Black consciousness to a head through his electoral campaign.
Just as Farrakhan supported Jackson’s attempt to gain clout within the system, many Blacks who do not share Farrakhan’s nationalist views still welcome his adherence to Jackson’s cause. The bloc seemed to represent the need for Black unity, self-assertion and self-defense. When the power brokers tried to hobble Jackson by hypocritically using Farrakhan’s words against him, Blacks saw the racist attack underneath the charges and lined up in support.
Each in his own way, Jackson and Farrakhan believe in the American dream: social mobility, working one’s way up the ladder provided by capitalism. The desire to “move on up” involves a change in class and is of necessity an individualistic outlook; small numbers of petty-bourgeois aspirants succeed, and this success serves to quicken the (doomed) hopes of the majority. For the excluded races, religions and nationalities, moreover, the few individual “successes” are possible only through consolidation of group power, the ability to exact demands from the ruling class.
Significantly, the Jews are a key model for many Black leaders engaged in this quest. Many Blacks (and many Jews) believe that Jews as a group, once beyond the pale, have “arrived” in the mainstream of American society. There has been some assimilation, but it was made possible only by the strengthening of Jewish solidarity on the terms of the bourgeois and professional Jewish organizations. This permitted the triumph of Zionist ideology among U.S. Jews, and was itself accelerated by Zionism and its result, Israel. The Black future that Farrakhan desires mirrors the Jewish development he despises as its rival. Not accidentally, until the 1960’s all wings of the Black leadership were pro-Zionist. Many believed that if the Jews could make it (both in the U.S. and in their own Zion), then Blacks could too.
The Jews, however, arrived during capitalism’s Indian summer, the postwar prosperity bubble. It won’t happen again: the pie is shrinking, not growing. Moreover, the bourgeois and middle-class sectors of groups that have recently “made it” are becoming capitalism’s border guards, trying to keep out newer claimants. The middle classes are being squeezed, and most American Jews are white-collar workers whose hopes of rising further are evaporating. Increasingly reactionary “neo-conservative” Jewish leaders are mobilizing against Blacks as the enemy whose “quotas” are seen as blocks to Jewish hopes. The fact that Jewish acceptance in America is so precarious (despite the new superpatriots’ illusions) only accelerates hostility to Black self-assertion. Yet there are still many Jews who know that becoming oppressors here or in Israel is no way to end the oppression of Jews. One distorted reflection of this was the higher vote for Jesse Jackson among Jews than among whites in general. 
Nationalism Vs. Socialism
As the capitalist crisis deepens, the sense of desperation among Blacks is bound to grow. The divide-and-conquer tactics of capitalism are already apparent. The great hopes held by Black workers in the Democratic Party and in Jesse Jackson’s campaign are already being undercut; their enemy now seems to be not only those who precariously made it up the ladder but also competing “out groups” like Hispanics and women. The daily papers are full of stories about conflicts over positions and crumbs between the sectors’ rival brokers. In everyday life Black and Hispanic workers view each other not only as jointly oppressed comrades but also as competitors for jobs and housing. The potential for a separatist go-it-alone consciousness looms.
But capitalism itself also produces a deeper trend of working-class, interracialist and internationalist consciousness that recognizes all workers as victims of capitalism. Economic and social crisis makes radical polarization – toward both socialism and reaction – inevitable, and this will force the nationalists to alter or adapt their separatist message.
Nationalist ideology accepts the inevitability of capitalism, but desperate people do not so easily fall for the absurdity of “free enterprise” and “no state intervention.” The nationalists will have to take into account the appeal of their socialist rival and the mass need for social relief and self-defense (especially for Blacks) in the face of economic collapse. Farrakhan or his descendants will have to cover their capitalist beliefs with social demagogy in the name of the truest nationalism – as did the Hitlers and Coughlins of the 1930’s. His petty-bourgeois forces and lumpenproletarian base will inevitably move toward some form of fascist demagogy. Although Farrakhan is not now a fascist, he will be pushed that way if he tries to champion the “Black nation” in severely worsening times. 
Nationalism Of Oppressor Vs. Oppressed
The Zionists and leftists who denounce Farrakhan as a “would-be Hitler” are missing a crucial point. Hitler’s fascism arose out of the nationalism of the dominant race; Farrakhan as a Black man can only represent the reactionary impulses of the petty bourgeoisie of an oppressed race. There is an ironic precedent for this sort of role: the Jewish Zionists in relation to Nazi Germany, and Farrakhan already knows their history. As he observed in his “gutter religion” speech, “So Zionists made a deal with Hitler. These are the same people that condemn me for saying Hitler was a great man, but a wicked man.”
It is true. Zionists concluded a deal with the Nazis to get money out of Europe to help build a Jewish state (on land where another people lived); they broke an international boycott of German goods to do this. The fascistic wing of Zionism also supplied Jewish police for the ghettoes, collaborating with Nazi rule in East Europe. During the war, radical right-wing Zionists tried to deal with Hitler to undermine British colonial rule in Palestine. The other side of the Zionist crime was to oppose resistance and class struggle in Europe on the grounds that Jews ought to go to Palestine rather than fight at home.
Of course, the Zionists never got the big deal they wanted with Hitler: an agreement that Germany would be for the Germans and Palestine for the Jews. Just as capitalism today needs to scapegoat Black people as a threat to the jobs of whites when the system plunges into crisis, so the Nazis used the Jews as a different kind of devil. The Jewish banker became the safety-valve enemy to release hatred of capitalism. Those Jews today who think they have achieved acceptance by getting America to view Arabs as money-grubbing bankers (and worse) are in for a rude awakening. American capitalism will not hesitate to follow the Nazi example when it feels the need to substitute the symbol of Shylock for the reality of Uncle Sam.
Extreme Black nationalists, whether Farrakhan or others, will inevitably be forced to try to deal with their oppressor as did the Zionists. But when capitalism is deeply in crisis, as it was then and will be again, oppressor nationalism demands not the end of capitalism but the destruction of another nation. In the coming crisis, Blacks will face a holocaust too, even worse than what their ancestors suffered on these shores. When “Black Zionism” seeks to strike a deal with imperialism, it will have as little success as did its model. 
The Black Struggle Ahead
If the grim crisis we think possible turns into reality, it is not excluded that Black people in the United States could be forged into a nation. The possibility seems unreal now for most Blacks; it lies not so much in their nature as in that of their enemy. Holocausts have created nations before. Even though Marxists are not advocates of nations and national boundaries, we stand squarely for the right to self-determination of the oppressed, including U.S. Blacks. We urge Blacks not to choose separatism, despite their group oppression, because Black unity under capitalism (even Black capitalism) means continued subordination to imperialism; that has been the lesson of all the independent nations of Africa, Asia and Latin America. But Black people have the right of self-determination, and the choice is theirs. The only alternative is a united proletarian resistance to capitalism; by our defense of Black rights we seek to demonstrate the possibility of genuine internationalism and class consciousness.
Only a mass working-class movement in the U.S. can break through the sectoralism that divides the masses in the rulers’ interest. Yet the Black masses, given their history of slavery and oppression, have a deep-seated need for Black unity, identity and defense. The Marxist attitude to this need is similar to our defense of the right to self-determination: we do not oppose Black unity to class-wide unity. U.S. history has given Black working people absolutely no reason yet to trust the white working class to defend them, and if the two are counterposed Black workers face a desperate choice.
But the two choices need not be counterposed. Black unity as proclaimed by the Jacksons and Farrakhans indeed means united exploitation under the imperialist boot. Black workers, however, through their more advanced political understanding compared to the majority of white workers, and in part through building their own organizations, will provide much of the leadership for the entire working class. Their strategic position in heavy industry and in the major cities enables them to play a leading role that would have been impossible decades ago.
One model for Black workers to avoid is that of today’s American Jews. In the past there was a powerful movement of revolutionary proletarian consciousness among Jewish workers, but it was dissolved by the advance of the Jewish bourgeoisie and the erosion of internationalism. It is not too late for all sections of the working class to learn from the Jewish experience. One lesson is central. In the 1930’s, inspired in part by the defeat of the European Jews, the black Marxist C.L.R. James and Leon Trotsky began to shape the idea of building an independent Black workers’ organization for unity and self-defense; revolutionaries would work in it and campaign to win the Black masses to the cause of socialism. It is still necessary to fight for this today as part of the struggle for building the revolutionary proletarian party in the United States.

Democratic Party: Disaster for Blacks

Socialist Voice No. 20 (Winter 1984)
 Transcribed, Edited and Formatted by Damon Maxwell in 2009 for the Encyclopedia of Trotskyism On-Line.
It is not unusual for the black leadership to be divided, so the current bitter dispute wracking the recognized black political establishment is hardly astonishing. Forces ranged around Rev. Jesse Jackson are pushing for his candidacy in the Democratic Party presidential primaries. Other leaders have favored early support to liberal white Democrats. But what is unusual is the political near-unanimity underlying the surface schism; both blocs agree on an electoral Democratic Party strategy for black America. This seeming paradox of schism and unity, however, only masks the crucial paradox: the unity so desperately needed by the black masses – indeed, by all workers – can come only through breaking the present coalescence at the top.
For all its narrowness and dead-end quality, the dispute over how to maximize black clout inside the Democratic Party reflects real questions. Jackson, at the June 1983 meeting of black leadership forces held in Chicago, steamrollered the passage of a resolution endorsing the idea of a black candidacy. Although the resolution did not name Jackson as the candidate, few observers doubted that he had anyone else in mind. The formation of an “exploratory committee” under the aegis of Jackson’s biggest promoter. Mayor Richard Hatcher of Gary, Indiana, was only one signal of his intentions. The “Run, Jesse, run!” outcry which greeted his appearances everywhere among black audiences is testimony not only to a genuine sentiment which is beginning to swell but to an organized drive by a wing of the black political elite.
Ranged in opposition to a black presidential campaign are such figures as Coretta Scott King, Washington D.C.’s Congressional Delegate Walter Fauntroy, NAACP leader Benjamin Hooks, Rev. Joseph Lowery of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), William Lucy of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, and Andrew Young, Mayor of Atlanta and Jimmy Carter’s front man in the United Nations. Most of them are overtly or covertly in support of Walter Mondale for the Democratic Party nomination.
The anti-Jackson forces argue that a black candidacy not only has no hope of winning but could also cripple the chances of the more liberal, pro-civil rights Democrats like Mondale. They assert that a black candidate would strain relations with the Democratic Party as a whole and its liberal wing in particular. A Jackson campaign could realistically garner only a handful of delegate votes at the party convention, given the Democratic Party rules. For this the whole network of relations built up for years with liberal politicians would be weakened.
The Jackson proponents do not claim that a black could win the nomination. They do believe that a black candidate could accelerate black registration, inspire a much larger black vote and help elect black candidates for lesser offices. They claim that Jackson’s campaign could force commitments on important issues from the frightened white liberal politicians. Even if Jackson cannot win many convention delegates, blacks will have consolidated themselves as a solid enough force so that the Democrats will have to take them more into account. Further, it is just possible that Jackson could place himself at the center of a wider “rainbow coalition,” which would include women’s, peace, ecology and Hispanic interest groups and thereby add to the blacks’ bargaining position.
The differences are clear enough, but the common agreement on the need for an electoral Democratic Party strategy is equally so. It is not by accident that the “black leadership family” is now called the 1984 Election Strategy Committee. The significance of this unanimity is highlighted by the fact that in the past, the black leadership has been torn apart by radically different perspectives on how to achieve goals and has rarely united in giving priority to electoralism. Non-violent direct action, massive judicial efforts, religious appeals and social quietism, as well as guerrilla warfare, separatist tactics, self-defense and even mass action, have all been advocated at one time or another by major leaders.
But hardly an article is written today on black politics which does not quote some politician or minister asserting the blacks have learned to “play the game” and that they have “matured.” The present leadership meetings consist of Democratic Party politicians and influential organizational and ministerial leaders, and are far less varied than, for example, the conferences in the 1970’s whose attendees included proponents of radical action. Today, advocates of strategies more radical than electoralism exist only on the periphery of the black leadership; center stage is accorded to the camp followers of the Democratic Party. And their politics fit the mold. Both wings are undeniably pro-capitalist, and pro-U.S. capitalist at that, which means pro-imperialist. The newly presidential Jackson originally supported keeping U.S. troops fighting in Lebanon. “We have to live with certain of these contradictions,” he said (Village Voice, October 4), echoing the apologetics of imperialist liberals everywhere. After the 200 marines were killed he urged a U.S. pullout to allow less-exposed countries to pacify Lebanon for imperialism. Both Reagan and the Democrats seek to use pawn nations to front for U.S. stabilization plans in Central America. Jackson and other Democrats extend that policy to Lebanon.
The Democrats’ Historical Role
How did this happen? After all, it was only a few years ago that revulsion and contempt for the Democratic Party was so great even among those who grudgingly voted for it that no such total commitment could be made by public figures. Moreover, the economic tailspin with its inflation, unemployment, retreat on social welfare, educational collapse and urban decay accelerated throughout the 1970’s and blew away so much of the highly touted “permanent gains” of the “New Deal”, “Fair Deal” and “Great Society” that Democratic liberalism seemed like a macabre joke to dispossessed blacks. How is it that the Democrats are now being resurrected as the party of hope for the black masses (and the white as well)?
Blacks historically supported the Republican Party, the party of Lincoln, until the late 1920’s when they steadily turned toward the Democrats. This process accompanied the Northern and urban emigration of the hitherto predominantly Southern rural black population. The basis for the switch was similar to the enrollment of foreign immigrant workers into the Democratic city machines. The Democratic Party helped in the adjustment process for blacks and delivered crumbs, very small ones indeed, mostly to the tiny black petty bourgeoisie, petty job seekers, small businessmen, churchmen and the like. To others it offered a little hope, in the wake of the repression and collapse of the labor revolts of the post World War II period on the one hand and the massive Garvey movement on the other.
The working-class battles of the thirties endangered the very existence of capitalism. The threat to property posed by general strikes, sitdowns, plant seizures and mass battles forced concessions from the ruling class. Far from being the benevolent dispensers of largesse, Roosevelt and the Democrats doled out concessions actually won at the factory gates and on the streets by fighting workers. Blacks played a limited but important role in key strike situations. But their small voting power, determined by their small numbers in the North and discrimination sanctioned by government and the Democratic Party in the South, meant that blacks had little political weight. Blacks did benefit as a result of the general concessions won by the working class, but given their frequent status as landless agricultural laborers and marginal workers in marginal industries, they benefited even less than others.
Party Rested on Racism
The Democratic Party rested during the thirties on a base of urban workers and small farmers in the South and elsewhere plus various layers of the middle class. The dominant control over the party, however, lay with sections of the big bourgeoisie coupled to reactionary Southern rural landlords, local businesses and oil operators. The landlords and small-town businessmen dominating the “Solid South” were the keystone in maintaining the party’s stability. The big-city machines, largely controlled by Catholic immigrant leaders, the unions (both AFL and especially the new, radical CIO) as well as the blacks, were all tied to the party whose existence was maintained by a venomously, anti-Catholic, anti-labor and racist power center, later named the “Dixiecrats.” That is why the liberal Democrats talked loudly but swung small sticks at the Southern reactionaries. Much of the financial as well as political power of the city machines and the ethnic and labor leaders came from their links to Democratic power in Washington – which in turn rested upon the Southern Bourbons.
The other keystone of the alliance was the Communist Party and other leftists, who played a crucial role in allying with Roosevelt and the Democrats to ensure that rebellious workers did not transcend industrial unionism into political action independent of the Democratic Party. (See  U.S. Labor and the Left in Socialist Voice No. 5.)
War and post-war prosperity wedded to substantive transformations in agrarian and industrial technology transformed the South into a predominantly urban and increasingly industrial area. Economic power shifted to urban capitalists in the South, but for many years political power remained in the hands of the Dixiecrats. Neither the national Democrats nor the Southern urban capitalists (and their Northern partners) wished to do more than cosmetic reforms, since the Dixiecrats remained a bulwark against unionization in the South and the key to maintaining the Democratic Party nationally. (For details, see “Class Struggle in the South,” Socialist Voice Nos. 2 and 3.)
Mass Upheavals Force Changes
The post-World War II prosperity, the cold war, the colonial revolution overseas and now the increasingly urbanized condition of blacks all played a role in spurring the mass black upheavals of the late 1950’s the 1960’s and the early 1970’s. Among other consequences, the rebellion destroyed the power of an old black leadership in the South which rested upon a matter-of-fact alliance with the segregationists. It also forced Washington and the Southern urban bourgeoisie to assume the political reins in the South and grudgingly oppose the waning Dixiecrats.
The comparatively small share of prosperity that reached blacks served to reinforce and expand the small middle-class leadership. The threat of the black masses demanding an end to discrimination and the right to jobs, reinforced the role of black leadership organizations as brokers between the desires of the masses and the bourgeoisie and its political representatives in the Democratic Party. In the South, the new circumstances helped create an urban-based coalition between the newly empowered capitalist forces and the black leadership, based on the end of formal, legal discrimination. Black leaders thereby played an increasingly important role in the political structure and in the Democratic Party in key cities of the South, in alliance with the “business community.”
The national Democratic Party also took black leaders into greater account. However, the power structure was unwilling to disperse significant benefits to the black brokers. Martin Luther King, Jr. spend innumerable hours explaining to the Democrats that they ought to increase the sops given blacks through his good offices, to give him a few “victories” instead of standoffs; for if he was unable to deliver, mass black anarchy would occur.
As Malcolm X pointed out in his analysis of the 1963 March on Washington:
When Martin Luther King failed to desegregate Albany, Georgia, the civil rights struggle in America reached its low point. King became bankrupt almost, as a leader. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference was in financial trouble; and it was in trouble, period, with the people when they failed to desegregate Albany, Georgia. Other Negro civil-rights leaders of so-called national stature became fallen idols.
Malcolm went on to point out the underlying relations between the Democrats in Washington and the black leadership shown through the microcosm of the events leading up to the march:
It was the grass roots out there in the street. It scared the white man to death, scared the white power structure in Washington, D.C. to death. I was there. When they found that this black steamroller was going to come down on the capital, they called in Wilkins, they called in Randolph, they called in these national Negro leaders that you respect and told them, Call it off.’ Kennedy said, Look, you all are letting this thing go too far.’ And Old Tom said, Boss, I can’t stop it, because I didn’t start it.’ I’m telling you what they said. They said, I’m not even in it, much less at the head of it.’ They said, These Negroes are doing things on their own. They’re running ahead of us.’ And that old shrewd fox, he said, If you all aren’t in it, I’ll put you in it. I’ll put you at the head of it. I’ll endorse it. I’ll welcome it. I’ll help it. I’ll join it.’...

Once they formed (the Council for United Civil Rights Leadership) with the white man over it, he promised them and gave them $800,000 to split up among the Big Six; and told them that after the march was over they’d give them $700,000 more. A million and a half dollars – split up between leaders that you have been following, going to jail for, crying crocodile tears for. And they’re nothing but Frank James and Jesse James and the what-do-you-call-’em brothers.
As soon as they got the setup organized, the white man made available to them top public-relations experts; opened the news media across the country at their disposal, which then began to project these Big Six as the leaders of the march. Originally they weren’t even in the march.
As the 1960’s struggle deepened the black masses got out of hand. Riots and rebellions burgeoned in ghetto after ghetto as the masses, tired of promises, demanded delivery. The initial leadership of the NAACP, SCLC, CORE and SNCC increasingly lost power to newer and younger black power forces who tried to reflect the radical demands of the black masses.
But not even these elements could connect solidly with the masses in motion. Riot after riot, revolt after revolt demonstrated that if the moderate leadership, including King, could hardly venture into the ghettoes safely, even the more accepted leaders could hot lead or control the events. The masses were out of hand, as the white bourgeois political forces learned when they attempted to pacify the upheavals through dealings with local leaders who proved to have no mass following or power to stop the upheaval.
Struggles Won Concessions
It was in this period, up through the early 1970’s, that the political establishment began to dole out concessions to blacks under the threat of mass struggles. Of course, as with all concessions and reforms, the bourgeoisie did it in its own way. It chanelled the fund so as to build up a leadership in the communities that would have actual clout among black workers through its brokerage role. This meant recruitment into the various programs, projects,  plans, community-elected boards, etc., of elements who were radical enough (often sincerely so, for what that’s worth) to gain a response. Thus, painstakingly, a new leadership (including some elements of the old) was slowly forged. The, remaining prosperity, although imperiled by the increasingly dangerous crisis of capitalism which resurfaced in the late 1960’s, was sufficient to dole out enough gains to provide hope for masses of blacks. This response to mass pressure came at a time when blacks, fed up with liberal promises, were voting less and less and were becoming more and more contemptuous of the Democratic Party.
Recession Boosts Electoralism
The revolt of the black masses was stalled during the 1970’s, partially as a result of the transitory gains it made, partially because it found no alternative leadership it trusted to fight for real and lasting changes. But the major reason why the movement did not transcend its previous limits was the recession of 1973-75, which devastated black hopes. The recession put an end to the wave of wildcat strikes which shook American industry in the early 1970’s. It quieted the riot-torn ghettoes. It enabled the established union bureaucrats and the patched-up and refurbished black leadership to find a way to maintain their grip over their bases.
Gingerly at first, the AFL-CIO began to point to the Democratic Party and electoralism as the safe and responsible alternative to industrial militancy. By keeping struggles localized and separate, with the aid of the recession it succeeded in regaining its authority. The black leaders too began slowly moving toward increased Democratic activity.
Militancy subsided and hopelessness grew at the base; for years there was little popular response. Black workers tried riots again in Miami and elsewhere. Isolated and without clear leadership, in bad times when the bourgeoisie was on the offensive and would and could give less, they failed. Gradually, seeing no other alternative and no avenue to mass action, working-class people of all races renewed their interest in electoralism.
The Census Bureau reported that workers were beginning to vote more often, particularly the jobless and particularly blacks. 34.1 percent of the jobless said they voted in the 1982 Congressional elections as opposed to 27.4 percent in 1978. Black voting went from 37 percent in 1978 to 43 in 1982, twice the increase among whites. The traditional gap between white and black proportional turnouts at the polls narrowed.
Even within the diversity of black leaders during the 1970’s, the specific weight of Democratic politicians was slowly but steadily climbing. Historically, of course, black office-holders had been few and far between, and black leaders not directly involved in the political structure (such as ministers or professional organizational executives) would be dealt with by white politicians because they carried more weight. But politicians were becoming a new and important factor. For example, between 1978 and 1982 the number of black state legislators increased from 35 to 355, the biggest leap ever. Nevertheless, the total of 5160 black officials nationally, while significantly higher than in the past, still amounts to only one percent of all elective offices in the U.S.
The drive to get blacks to the polls in order to increase the specific weight of the black leadership within the Democratic Party is growing. The Atlanta-based Voter Education Project has been conducting a major campaign to register 350,000 new Southern black voters by the end of the year. Supermarkets, shopping mails and department stores have set up permanent registration tables. Radio commercials are designed to add to the hoopla. The NAACP aims to register two million new voters nationwide by the end of the year. It is sponsoring an “Overground Railroad” to accelerate its effort to reach potential black voters. However, the most significant jumps in black voting stem from elections in which black candidates run with a chance of winning. Last but not least, Jesse Jackson has been crusading day after day to whip up registration sentiment among black youth, with substantial results. The pattern is clear. So are the reasons. The consequences for the black masses will be disastrous.
Let us sum up. The Democratic Party has never been the source of black gains. At times it disburses the gains actually won by mass challenges to the system. Its function is to allocate these gains through a system of brokers (leaders) who have or who have been given clout within specific sectors organized as “interest groups.” The Democratic Party delivers only to the degree that capitalism can afford to. It could never, even at the height of a prosperity greater than any prosperity that ever occurred in the history of the world deliver enough to feed, clothe, and house its entire working class. Now that the bubble has burst and the chronic, mortal crisis has resurfaced, the sops are tinier and the many previous gains are eroded or taken entirely away.
The Democratic Party is the institution within which the various sectors are forced to exercise their clout against each other for a portion of the small take. Not only does the party mechanism, with its rewards dependent upon votes and maneuvers, encourage sectors to vie with each other for scarce sops – but within each group, separate interests are forced to clash in order to maximize their take. Democratic Party politics internally – with city pitted against city, region against region, state against state, Hispanics against blacks against Poles against Italians against Irish against Jews for a piece of the federal budget action – is the war of all against all which mirrors life under capitalism. That is the purpose of the Democratic Party. Through the allocation of sops and reforms, it is designed to divide, conquer and destroy, existing or potential mass movements. (No wonder the present dispute within the black leadership is so hostile.
As we pointed out in our last issue, the rewards given through the brokering facility of the leaderships of the various sectors are designed also to split up class consciousness since class demands cannot be met by capitalism. This is not just “theory” but practice; and as we showed, sections of the bourgeoisie are perfectly well aware of it, discuss it and refine it. As well, the rewards must of necessity be distributed unequally within each group: the brokers, bourgeoisie (if any) and the middle strata get the most, and the base, the more exploited workers get vicarious identifications, group pride, hope for the future – but far less or nothing at all for themselves. When things get worse, as they have been, the sops dwindle to nothing and even the upper layers of the particular sector are undercut. This is exactly what has happened among blacks, and with a vengeance.
The Census Bureau recently reported with amazing understatement that recession, unemployment and poverty had halted the “momentum of social and economic improvement” for blacks. The disproportionate attack on blacks as opposed to whites, and the fact that it reaches up into the middle strata so dramatically, is hot only the cause of fears, anguish and the revival of social motion among the mass of black workers and unemployed. It is also behind the present turmoil within the black leadership.
The Divided Black Democrats
At first glance, the difference between the anti-Jackson forces and the pro-Jackson forces seems to be between those black politicians who depend either upon white voices for their power or upon their ties to white politicians and interests. It is no accident, therefore, that Andrew Young, Mayor Coleman Young of Detroit, Mayor W. Wilson Goode of Philadelphia and many of the Congressional Black Caucus members support Mondale rather than Jackson. Likewise, Mayor Richard Hatcher of Gary, Indiana, whose power rests on an almost exclusively black base, supports Jackson. It is no accident that aspiring black candidates will tend to favor Jackson because he will accelerate the black for a black vote and will quite probably enlarge the numbers of elected blacks.
There is more to it, however. The Jackson candidacy finds great support among the ministers who constitute such an important part of the black leadership.. As Time magazine recently pointed out, “If Jackson runs, the foundation for his campaign will be provided by the network of black churches across the nation, still the most influential institution in the black community. In July, 125 ministers met in East St. Louis to form a Draft Jesse Jackson Committee, aimed at collecting one million signatures.”
On the contrary, the professionals associated with the NAACP, the SCLC and above all the Urban League oppose a black candidacy. Their budgets are substantially dependent upon white philanthropies and corporations. It is not that these people are simply bought off, rather their whole mode of thought is conditioned by their material base. Social change and defense of blacks (and their personal security in the organizational bureaucracies) as they see it rests with close ties to “allies” who have the same desire for ameliorative change designed to prevent outbreaks which threaten their common stability. Their hostility to such a campaign at the moment is quickened by the economic crisis. The recent demeaning court fight between the NAACP and the NAACP Legal Fund after so many years of coexistence was due to their desperate competition for funds. They don’t want to strain relations with the liberal white bourgeoisie.
The leadership’s willingness to maintain ties to whites at all costs was shown at the heralded August 27 March on Washington led by the black establishment. The program of jobs, peace and freedom, already vague enough to mean all things to virtually all people, was made even vaguer by attempts to water it down. Any idea that “peace” meant opposition to existing war was ruled out to satisfy Zionist organizations and the labor bureaucrats. “Jobs” has so little content that General Motors can sound more radical on the subject. “Freedom” was not allowed to mean reproductive rights for women, and the march leaders attempted to “defend” gay rights by ignoring gays’ existence. Even so, the AFL-CIO was present only in the form of its black-based and leftish-led unions; Lane Kirkland stayed away. The Urban League, fearful of the straining of relations, opposed the march. The pro-Israel groups refused to be mollified.
These pulls and tears also affect the Jackson wing. They too have “connections” with the white-dominated power structure of the Democratic Party and the myriad of organizations, philanthropies and institutions interpenetrated with it. But their relative insulation is higher. Hatcher has less concern about immediate white tie-ups than does either of the Youngs. So too with the black churches. They rest foursquare on the black community. Historically they were not only its strongest institution but also its most nearly independent one. While their mortgages might be held by white-owned banks, their essential financial base is in the black caste. It is no accident that they are aligned to a Jackson candidacy.
As the contest unfolds, the heat builds up. At a recent meeting in Chicago, Time reported that Andrew Young defensively challenged Jesse Jackson and added: “I consider myself in the family’.” Jackson retorted, “Dick Hatcher is family. You’re in the neighborhood.”
Clearly Jackson is on the offense and the anti-candidacy forces are retreating. In fact, Young and many of the others are being forced to cover their pro-Mondale support and either line up behind Jackson or equivocate as the campaign develops. They may have no choice, given the fact that while they must retain ties to the whites, they are worthless to the white capitalists if they are read out of the black leadership “family.”
Assimilation vs. Integration
In the past, one current of the black leadership pointed to assimilation and integration as the road forward. The other current was identified as separatist or nationalist. (See “The Black Struggle Today” in Socialist Voice No. 7.) Integrationism has always meant equality and acceptance of blacks by white America into its class structure as it stands. It reflected the deep need in the black community for equality and the social action to achieve it. Nationalism, on the other hand, reflected the need of blacks for group defense, distrust in the promises always broken by others and group solidarity. Its ideology was that of national separation, but in reality it reflected attempts to build separate and independent economic, social and political institutions in existing black sections of America. Integration was impossible under capitalism, which could never afford real equality. Nationalism was equally impossible in that the black economy solidly intertwined with and subordinate to the dominant white capitalist American economy. In imperialist America neither was a way out.
Both middle-class ideologies picked up real support in the black proletariat and subproletariat. Integrationism could entrap black workers because of its seeming identity with the interracialism they seek, which can only be achieved in the internationalist world of abundance under socialism. Nationalism too was a class-negated version of the masses’ understanding, taking advantage of their yearning for group solidarity to survive and their awareness that social promises by others are believable only if blacks wield power.
Jackson bases his campaign on the middle-class sectors who wish to strengthen their own roles by maximizing group power. His relation to the Democrats is similar to that of the machine-oriented white ethnic politicians in its openly quid-pro-quo character. The party, he has said, “cannot receive investment without promising dividends and returns.” His readiness to sit down with Alabama’s Governor Wallace shows him dealing in the Democratic Party in the hard-headed terms that the game demands. His opponents reflect the traditional liberal reformer style which, while not averse to building its black voting base, emphasizes instead integrated leadership of “men of good will” fighting for common social needs. Jackson’s self-help program is hardly the same as the grandiose nationalist ambitions for a separate economy, but it reflects more moderate impulses of a similar kind.
Democrats and the Black Masses
Jackson is feeling his bats also because his campaign touches a responsive chord among black workers and unemployed. “Run Jesse, run!” was not manufactured out of thin air.
The sentiment is growing: “We want ours.” This is seen in ethnic-racial terms, not class terms. All blacks are under the gun, even if the attack is disproportionately heavy on the poorer mass. Unfortunately, the masses have interpreted past history as being the failure “to play the game.” What did mass action, riots and strikes get us in the end? What we should have done or should do now is what other sectors and ethnic groups have done to get ahead: play the game inside the Democratic Party; it’s the only game in town. That’s why the black masses, as opposed to the leaders, are not ecstatic about the Democratic Party. They know the other racist forces that are there, they know it isn’t a question of good will, of liberal do-goodism, philanthropy and the like – it’s quid pro quo. You can’t be enthusiastic about such an institution; you hold your nose and grab what you can.
Take the August 27 march. The leadership would have loved to turn the march into a rally for the Democratic Party. It could not do so. The march was anti-Reagan and for voter registration, but the call could not be, “Let’s all turn out for the good old Democratic Party!” No Democratic Party leaders (not even Presidential candidates, aside from Jackson) were presented to the crowd. While the intent of the march leaders was to begin building up for such an ardent embrace, it could not yet be brought off. This is not because the leaders aren’t in love already. It is not because the largely middle-class and labor aristocratic marchers won’t vote Democrat. The absent black masses will also probably vote Democrat; but just that the mass of black people themselves still regard the Democratic Party with contempt, coolness and a lack of great expectations.
We are for Jackson, people feel, not the Democrats. But one of the reasons we are for Jackson is that he is mobilizing a black power base inside the party of reality, not a powerless sure loser outside. Oh yes, Jackson will lose inside the Democratic Party, but that’s not the point. We can’t win the whole pie, but we want our share and we can force them to give it to us.
His opponents call Jackson a demagogue, and certainly he is that – an opportunist and a hypocrite. Masses of black people are perfectly aware of his demagogy, but they view with disdain the more hypocritical elitism of liberals who make lofty promises but don’t deliver. They advocate programs which always seem to sacrifice strong black solidarity for hollow promises and Utopian dreams of whites and blacks hand-in-hand together. Maybe that’s real at Yale, but not in Harlem.
Black solidarity is a need that is immediately perceived. Indeed, Jackson is well aware that feelings of black unity as a result of the Carter-Reagan attack are burgeoning, with or without him. His forces seek to channel this justified sentiment into support for the leadership’s Democratic Party strategy. Many are buying this line despite their contempt for the Democrats, because they believe that Jackson’s black solidarity efforts will prove more important than his party ties. But the sense of unity that Jackson is playing upon is actually a two-edged sword. 
Blacks and Class Struggle
The black masses perceive part of the nature of the Democratic Party but not the whole of it. They have learned that their past mass actions failed. They have not learned that the reason for their failure was that they didn’t transcend the Democratic Party and smash it, not that they didn’t use it.
The missing dimension in this black working-class view is class itself. Black workers do understand that white workers are also hurting; but they are also aware of the racism of many white workers. They also do not see any class banner to group around. Does the labor bureaucracy provide a better, more attractive way out than black identity and Jesse Jackson? Black unionized workers have even greater contempt for the union bureaucracy than do the whites. In the absence of class action, class consciousness is predictably low. And this, given the reality of American society, spells disaster for blacks.
Racism is fundamental to the existence of American capitalism. That is the Achilles heel of the middle-class strategies. For capitalism requires a permanent army of unemployed. It must divide the working class by wielding more-favored workers against a clearly demarcated outcaste group occupying the lowest rungs on the. ladder. For black workers to play the divisive, competitive game that is the heart of the Democratic Party strategy is to guarantee their defeat. Black workers above all need a class-wide strategy to survive.
If the struggle is confined to the Democratic Party, the different sectors will be competing with each other in an environment in which the government has far less fat than even during the last great depression. Then it could go into debt to finance the small sops it gave; today the staggering debt is already a major factor dragging the system down. So the competition can only intensify.
White workers as well as blacks face mounting unemployment. Those who still think they have it made are in for a great shock. American capitalism has always used elements among impoverished white workers to attack their black fellow-workers. Under these conditions intensified sectoral competition will lead to race war, a leap toward fascism.
In the 1930’s Southern segregation stabilized the Democratic Party coalition by keeping blacks so far down and so marginal to heavy industry that they were only a symbolic challenge to white workers. That is no longer true. Race war will come quicker and more viciously among today’s Democratic voters than yesterday’s. The racist vitriol spouted by white Democratic leaders in Chicago trying to inflame their sectorally divided base is only a mild foretaste. And this is a struggle that blacks cannot win. 
Jesse Jackson’s chasing after rainbows will not help. A coalition composed of environmentalists, Hispanics, women, gays, senior citizens, etc., with each constituent part organized for its own advancement, is a set-up for the capitalists’ divide and conquer tactics. In the setting of economic crisis, when the illusion of a pot of gold is blown away, the different components with their bourgeois leaders will inevitably turn on each other.
This is the deadly trap black workers are being led into today. But the situation is far from hopeless. Just as in the 1930’s, just as is happening in a dozen countries around the world today, American working people will inevitably fight back against the capitalist assault. They will fight not only out of desperation against the loss of their material gains but also from their strength: it is they who make industry produce, who yield the capitalists’ profits – and who therefore can stop production, stop profits, and restart industry on a socialist, non-profiteering basis. Black workers, among the most exploited, are also among the most strategically located in heavy industry in the United States.
Moreover, there is another major difference between today and the 1930’s. Not only is Roosevelt’s Democratic Party ally, the Southern industrial landlord, gone, but so is his solid left ally that served to keep the workers from independent political action. The Communist Party is today a shadow of the powerful force in the unions and the factories that it was in the thirties. Its power among black workers is also greatly reduced. Today’s left, divided into a myriad of groups the bulk of which pimp for the Democratic Party, cannot form such a unified force of betrayal again. Therein lies the hope that mass action, the general strike, which unifies the class in action will not be forced aside by fake leftists who have gained authority among workers. The weakness of the pseudo-socialist left today and the limitations of its passive electoralism can only serve to postpone the workers’ upheaval, not to prevent it.
Unity on Working-Class Terms
Jesse Jackson and similar demagogues, in playing upon the theme of black unity and promising gains impossible under capitalism, only whet the masses’ appetites. Even a passive electoral display of black power, coupled to the inevitable disappointment at its betrayal, could be an impetus toward the mass action it seeks to prevent. Over time it can lead to the rejection of the petty-bourgeois misleaders, both pro-capitalists like Jackson and “anti-capitalists” like his leftist cheerleaders who have too great a stake in the system to challenge it. This can lead to the creation of a Marxist revolutionary workers’ party to pose a real alternative to capitalism.
Such a revolutionary party will inevitably reflect the fact that blacks will play a leadership role in any American workers’ upheaval, far out of proportion to their minority numbers. It would not only proclaim the interracialist program so necessary for black workers but would champion the practical lighting experience of the super-exploited black caste. It would be a living example of black solidarity, one that would attract class-conscious white workers as well to the universal proletarian cause.
But such unity can come only on working-class terms with proletarian leadership, not that of the brokers and their narrow, sectoral sops. The truly American paradox is that, given the systemic racism and the economic crisis, few sectoral gains are possible for the most militant and anti-capitalist “sector” of the working class, the black masses. They cannot free themselves without leading the working class as a whole to a new world.



A History of Sino-Russian Relations
by Tien-fong Cheng
Public Affairs Press. 355 pps.
Many pro-nationalist books have been written in the United States. Some have been aimed at the liberals in an effort to reduce their antipathy toward greater aid to Chiang; some have aimed at consolidating the Knowlandites. A History of Sino-Russian Relations by Tien fong Cheng, how- [line of text missing] the internationalist moderates, the Eisenhower politicals – who are now at least thinking of revamping the U.S. attitude toward Stalinist China. For them, a “factual,” unsentimental, unadorned casebook is the indicated procedure; where the liberal desires social proofs and the Knowlandite wants Red-baiting, the moderate relies on more institutional descriptions.
Cheng serves up a lengthy background in his painstaking narration of Czarist investiture of the Chinese northern territories. This serves as evidence for his essential point: that the Communist seizure of power represents the culmination of a continual, unbroken pattern of Russian attempts to dominate China. For him, that is the real meaning of the Maoist revolution, since, in effect, he denies any indigenous character to Chinese Communism and considers the Chinese C.P. to have been simply a tool of Russian subversion.
Dr. Cheng’s accounts of Czarist Russia’s imperialist ventures into China is detailed and valuable for reference. He traces Russian expansion into Siberia culminating in clashes with tribes owing allegiance to the Manchus and describes the various treaties down through the years which gave Russia huge territories (Amur, Ussuri etc.), great military and economic penetration into Mongolia, Sinkiang, Manchuria, etc. Cheng then deals with the other imperialist powers and their roles in the rape of China, highlighting the conflicts of interest between Japan and Russia over Manchuria and the railways. Of course in this narration, the U.S. is the kindly foreign friend. Following his detailed backdrop of pure-1917 imperialist penetration, Cheng arrives at the Bolshevik revolution viz-à-viz China. One might think that the October Revolution itself was a topic of some importance to a consideration of A History of Sino-Russian Relations, however he gives it little attention.
 
>CHENG VIEWS THE CHINESE COMMUNIST Party as simply the mechanism of Russian subversion in China; and his lengthy discussion of the Kuomintang, the formation and role of the Communist Party and the Chinese Revolution of 1925–27 is utilized to prove his point. The revolution for Cheng was simply a patriotic one. The question of land reform, social revolution, the rights of workers are not dealt with. He portrays the Kuomintang as a vibrant, anti-warlord, anti-imperialist group devoted to Sun Yat-Sen’s famous Three People’s Principles (interestingly Cheng never mentions what they were).
Cheng accurately describes why the Kuomintang accepted the Chinese C.P. into its ranks and turned toward Russia; (1) because of the Versailles Treaty, (2) because of Russian guns and aid, (3) because of the need for organizational help, (4) because of the impact of the Russian Revolution on all Asia. He further states that the Communists immediately began to subvert the Kuomintang and attempt to seize control of this institution which had raised them from nothing and given them a place in a mass movement. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Kuomintang had been a small group of intellectuals and bourgeois who more or less based their aspirations on the strength of warlords aligned to it. The Communists and the Russian “advisor” Borodin showed Dr. Sun the usefulness of the mass movement; the possibilities that could be obtained with the support of the workers and peasants. Borodin held the Communists in check to prevent precipitous or divisive action within the Kuomintang. In fact, the C.P.’ers participated in the raising up of the mass movement and then the curbing of it so as not to offend the bourgeoisie. Consequently, the revolution, the mass movement, and the Communists were drowned in blood by Chiang Kai-Shek. This, Cheng views as a positive accomplishment.
After the revolution was smashed, Stalin finally ordered the Chinese C.P. to insurrection, but at that point it proved disastrous. The remnants of the C.P. and its following became guerillas and wandered through China setting up Soviet Republics which were soon smashed. Finally, after the famous Long March they lodged themselves in northern China to reappear forcefully, years later, during the Sino-Japanese war.
One thing is apparent in the story of the Chinese C.P. It represented indigenous growth in Chinese society itself as well as a Russian instrument. For better or worse it was the only group with a real appeal to the workers and peasants during the 1925–27 revolution and in the following difficult period. Even as a Stalinized party it survived and even expanded. No group without roots in the society, without representing at least some of the aspirations and needs of the people could have done so. A simple Russian extrusion certainly would have folded. In general, the C.P. though isolated from it, followed the Moscow line in the period leading up to and including the War. Within that context, though Mao Tse-tung put forward serious ideological differences with the Russian ideology: instead of basing themselves on workers the Chinese CP found roots in the peasantry and, secondly, Mao formulated basic differences on the nature of the future state.
The seizure of Manchuria by the Japanese brought into being a series of different attitudes on the part of Russia, including at one point, the recognition of and a treaty with the Manchukuo puppet state. As part of the popular front line the Chinese C.P. entered into an alliance with Chiang against the Japanese invaders. Chiang had been primarily concentrating on fighting the Communists and the possibility of social reforms, and consequently taking only hesitant actions against the Japanese. The famous “Sian Incident” as well as pressure from large sections of the Chinese people forced him to make a new turn. But he retreated constantly before the Japanese and tied up huge armies blockading his “allies in the north.”
Cheng tries to place blame for the ineffectiveness of the Chiang-C.P. alliance upon the shoulders of the Stalinists. However, beginning with the Nationalist attack on the Stalinist 4th Army, the Kuomintang was clearly the more disruptive. A major portion of the difficulty was due to the dynamism of Mao’s legions and the corrupt, demoralized and extortionist character of the Central Government and its troops. The Stalinists were able to maintain popular support in the areas they controlled by dispensing reforms, manipulating the various strata of the peasant populace, establishing peasant armies and organizations with an illusory semblance of democracy. Consequently their areas of influence widened and they were able to generate large scale guerilla activity behind the Japanese lines. In contradistinction to this, the Nationalist government was unable to organize the areas under its control. They imposed unfair taxation, extorted the local populations, repressed the “uncontrolled” popular movements.
It is interesting to note that Cheng rarely refers to the question of corruption and when he does it is a passing statement about war and the moral climate it engenders.
Despite America’s attempts to mediate between the Mao forces and the Central Government in order to create a coalition regime, the hostilities broke out afresh. At the start of the conflict the Kuomintang won some victories, but quickly the picture reversed itself and the more poorly equipped Maoist armies completely vanquished the Nationalist forces. Cheng feebly ascribes this to logistical questions plus demoralization of Chiang’s troops due to being away from home for so long. The clear facts in the situations were that the C.P. legions were a dynamic new force capable of appealing to the Chinese masses because of its anti-capitalism, its land reforms, its pretension of democracy, and its concern with village problems. This program masked the emergence of a new totalitarian class force which never intended to give free reins to the people.
The Kuomintang armies fell apart due to the absence of any popular support, because of their inability to accede to any popular needs, their looting and their corruption. Nationalist troops, in fact whole armies, deserted or capitulated, leaving huge amounts of American arms for the Stalinists. Russian military aid to the Chinese Stalinists was negligible and the reason for the victory of the revolution was in large part indigenous to China – the inability of capitalism to organize Chinese society – and the absence of a socialist alternative.
Cheng ends his book with a “description” of Formosa as it now is and a statement that the Kuomintang will once again rule China. It is a hope as empty as it is pious. The Maoist regime will be overthrown by the body of Chinese people, but they will never tolerate a return of the corrupt Kuomintang.
 

Black Leadership Crisis (Winter 1999)

Between the Devil, the Democrats — and the Dispossessed
Today’s Black Leadership Crisis

Proletarian Revolution No. 58 (Winter 1999) Transcribed, Edited and Formatted by Damon Maxwell and David Walters in 2008 for the Encyclopedia of Trotskyism On-Line.
Contrary to the claims of many, there is no vacuum of political leadership in the Black community today. The virtually unchallenged leader of Black America is William Jefferson Clinton. 
This does not mean that most Black people actively support or even care much about Clinton’s political fate. The masses of Blacks, especially the most oppressed layers, are quite unenchanted with Clinton and his party. But the political leadership of the Black struggle remains in the hands of pro-Clinton middle-level Blacks who cannot provide an alternative to the powers-that-be. 
The idea that “most Blacks support Clinton” is really spin put forward by self-interested politicians. During his impeachment traumas, Clinton has had no supporters more loyal than the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) and the Black political leadership in general. CBC notables like Maxine Waters, Charles Rangel, John Lewis, John Conyers and Major Owens made impassioned attempts to rally the Democrats in the House of Representatives, in a vain effort to hobble the impeachment inquiry. 
The Black Leadership Forum, composed of heads of prominent Black organizations, mounted an energetic campaign in support of the Democrats in the November elections, which everyone understood revolved around Clinton. Black preachers, publishers, and poets across the country weighed in to protect the beleaguered president and defend his conduct. Novelist Toni Morrison wasn’t alone in suggesting that Clinton’s hard-nosed response showed that he might have Blacks in his ancestry. 
What nonsense! The masses of Black and Latino people, especially the youth, are not fans of Clinton. Moreover, the poorest layers do not like the system they are forced to live under. They just do not see a viable alternative yet, even if they are fed up. But even today they hardly think of Clinton as “Brother Bill.” 
Since the ghetto rebellions of the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, a significant minority within Black America has achieved middle-class status, although the large majority remain poor and working-class. This “middle class” is not a class in the Marxist sense; it has no special relationship to the means of production. It is an extremely varied layer containing professionals, government bureaucrats and labor aristocrats. At the top it blends into the bourgeoisie; at bottom, into the working class. 
Black middle-class people have not been able to overcome systemic racism and therefore have not achieved social equality or incomes comparable with their white counterparts. Nevertheless, there is a sizeable income gap between the Black middle strata and working class. The contrast in material terms between the different classes and layers within the Black community explains much about the difference among Blacks in how Clinton is seen. 
Despite the prosperity hype pushed by the Reagan, Bush and Clinton administrations, the income gap between the better-off and the working class — Black, Latino and white — has been widening, and will widen more. It is up to the working class, especially the politically advanced layers of the Black working class, to fight for a real alternative. 
Is Clinton The Lesser Evil?
It is no accident that the same politicians who support Clinton’s imperialist attacks abroad have accepted devastating cuts in domestic social programs too. In 1996 (see “The Bankruptcy of ‘Progressive’ Politics,”Proletarian Revolution No. 53) we exposed the connivance of the labor and minority leaderships in the smashing of welfare and the imposition of workfare. We wrote
Coming on top of Clinton’s previous racist, anti-worker bills (immigration, “three strikes and you’re out,” anti-”terrorism”), this bill ended a pillar of liberal legislation won by the working class in the struggles of the 1930’s and 1960’s. ... Clinton not only managed to deliver the welfare crackdown but was still able to maintain social peace. ... The key reason was the support by the heads of mass labor, Black and Latino organizations, who didn’t blink an eye in urging the president’s re-election. They have the power to lead fights against the bourgeois attack — but chose instead to endorse the leader of the attack. 
Before Clinton, welfare was a thin “safety net,” a poor substitute for full employment at decent wages and real community care. (See Stop Workfare — Jobs for All! in PR 54.) Still, its destruction removed substantial past gains won by the poorest workers. This happened because the “leaders” led nothing to stop it. 
The welfare-to-workfare scheme dramatically exposed the gaping class fracture within the Black community. The liberal Black pols remained loyal to Clinton, grateful for the few patronizing dispensations that — to them — make up for the deadly backstabbings. They point to his appointments of Black officials and his lukewarm support for affirmative action. Can this make up for the hundreds of thousands of families knocked off welfare, denied health insurance, kicked out of housing, thrown out of jobs, beaten by racist cops or shoved into jail since Clinton took office? 
The president whose legacy has been to put more cops on the street and wage a masquerade “war on drugs” — along with other efforts to brutally intimidate Blacks and Latinos — deserves hatred, not fervent support. The Black leaders’ enthusiasm for Clinton and the Democrats boils down to the old blind alley of lesser evilism. Their main claim is that Clinton’s right-wing opponents have a racist agenda of rolling back the social, economic and political gains won by Blacks. Whatever his faults, they say, Clinton remains the lesser evil. 
It is obviously true that the Republican reactionaries do want to heighten racism and go after Blacks and other oppressed people, as well as the working class in general. In contrast, the Democrats do appoint Black officials and nominally defend affirmative action, in order to get Black electoral support — just as they offer token sops to women and unions. (This relationship has a long history see our pamphlet The Democratic Party Graveyard of Black Struggles.) That is the material basis for the “lesser evil” view. 
The ruling class understands this. For example, the Los Angeles riots that broke out after the cops were acquitted for the Rodney King beating in 1992, were a turning point for the ruling class. The top capitalists, frightened that George Bush’s barely hidden anti-Black stance would further spread “anarchy and rebellion,” moved to support Clinton for president. That didn’t mean they wanted to give substantive economic benefits or cede real social justices. Rather, they endorsed Clinton’s policy of a relativeslowdown in taking back the past gains that had built up the Black middle strata. They also favored his strategy of dappling the political structure with more Black faces. The idea was to deepen middle-class Blacks’ support for the status quo, hoping they in turn would hold down the potentially rebellious ghetto masses. 
Greater Evil Gets Greater Vote
The Democrats are just as driven to cut back the gains of minorities and the working class as the Republicans; they just use a somewhat different approach. And they get away with their attacks more easily than the Republicans because the masses’ misleaders are in bed with them. 
No doubt the overt across-the-board attacks advocated by the Gingrich-Lott-DeLay conservatives have aroused anger in all reaches of the Black community. If it had been Republicans who pushed through their program, Blacks, Latinos, women, gays and trade unionists would have been outraged. At minimum, popular unrest would have forced their capitulatory leaders to organize mass protests. But as we explained in PR 53
When Clinton carries out a chunk of that same program, the liberals and reformists work overtime to prevent mass action, lest it endanger Clinton’s re-election. It’s at least an even bet that if Bush were still president the welfare system would still be standing. In sum, the lesser evil cannot be seen as an unfortunately weak bulwark against the great evils’ assaults. It is Clinton’s program which delivers the greater blow, because Gingrich’s program cannot be carried out at this time. So, while Clinton is the lesser evil in theory, that makes him the greater evil in practice. As well, as the bourgeoisie is aware, it is part of a one-two punch, the left jab that softens up its victim for the later right cross — the knockout blow.
The Democrats, once forced to go along with progressive gains, today use that past record as credit to enable them to carry out the reactionary rollback. The Black politicians are their partners and pawns, presiding over an attack on people of color, especially on poorer workers. This tactic has worked for the moment but it can’t last, mainly because it has not prevented a continuing polarization among Blacks. Over the years, as the number of Black politicians in government rose, takebacks of past gains have risen in lock-step. 
When the ghetto riots broke out in the sixties and seventies, there was no leadership for the government to buy off that the masses would listen to. That is why the powers-that-be allowed the expansion of the Black middle strata and opened the door for more Black faces in government. But the tactic is losing its power as it becomes increasingly transparent. 
As this becomes clearer, the trend of declining Black participation in elections has become clearer as well. There is a clear correlation between class position and electoral participation
voting has gone down among lower-income Blacks, most of whom vote even less often than poor white workers. They understand that whether Democrats or Republicans win will make no basic difference in their lives. 
The leaders often give the excuse that the masses are the reason why they’re in the Democratic Party, but history testifies differently. The Black middle class, like the white, sees cause and effect upside-down. When the Black Democratic vote was plummeting in the late eighties, the political leadership clustered around the candidacy of Jesse Jackson, working overtime to bring the masses back to the polls and into the Democratic Party. When Jackson was not running, the Black vote diminished. And in the last two elections, which have essentially been referenda on Clinton, the Black vote has again been falling overall. 
Nevertheless, over 80 percent of Black voters chose Clinton in his two presidential races, and both times they provided the margin for his victories. The reason for the apparent contradiction is the class differentiation among Blacks. In the 1998 elections, the Black vote in a few crucial areas in the country bucked the trend and swelled, and once again proved decisive. Surveys confirm the fact that it was better-off Blacks who provided the votes for the Democrats, not the younger and poorer workers. 
The Attraction of Black Nationalism
A vague form of “nationalism” is often considered to be the dominant ideology within the Black community today. But to the overwhelming majority, this ideology does not refer to the classical indicator of Black nationalism, the goal of a separate nation-state. 
Black nationalism in the U.S. started out as an attempt by small businessmen (and those who aspire to that status) to secure some leverage within a racist society. The Black petty bourgeoisie aimed, consciously or not, to become compradors or middlemen exploiting Black toilers in a white-dominated economy. As the immediate exploiters of Black labor, they hoped to govern a semi-autonomous economy — in effect, an internal Black colony. But then, as now, the overwhelming majority of Blacks worked directly for white-owned capital, a relationship that the latter has no intention of surrendering. 
Today, along with the traditional petty bourgeoisie, layers of the new middle class are also caught up in Black nationalism. They do not fantasize about a distinct Black economy, but they do approve of a political outlook based on Black identity. Having achieved some economic gains, they are understandably bitter that the race barrier is still very much in place. (One glaring proof: anti-Black police brutality does not discriminate by class.) They can’t escape second-class treatment in the white world, so they seek redress via some form of “Black unity.” 
Nationalism vs. Integrationism
The pervasive racist (and anti-working class) outlook in the U.S. automatically lumps together ghetto workers with the criminal lumpenproletariat that preys on them. Some middle-class Blacks share much of the negative image of the Black working class. Many of them not only admire Clinton but are also drawn to Louis Farrakhan, who demands that the Black poor “atone” and that Black men “take responsibility for their women and children” and “pull themselves up by their bootstraps.” Farrakhan’s clout in the ghetto holds out hope that the race as a whole can be “uplifted” — that is, achieve American middle-class values. 
For these reasons, Farrakhan’s base of support has been the petty bourgeoisie and important sections of the middle class, but he is also respected by many working-class Blacks as well. Nevertheless, the “nationalism” of the masses is still quite different than the “nationalism” of the upper layers, and the reasons for its attraction are different. 
Nationalism’s appeal in the ghettoes has always been its stress on the need for a united Black defense in the face of perpetual racism. The working class, highly realistic, never bought the idea that this U.S. would turn color-blind. Therefore, while Black workers always welcomed every blow against Jim Crow segregation, they never took integrationism to heart as an ideology, even in its heyday. Black nationalists could speak on street corners in the working-class ghettoes even when people thought they were wrong; the integrationist NAACPers rarely attempted to. Pro-integration ministers did have a following, but the reality of their all-Black congregations counted for more than idealist prayers for color-blindness. 
To the masses, integrationism looked like a theory that would isolate and therefore disunite Black people in the face of a still racist and dangerous environment. That is why court-enforced school integration — dispersal of their children onto hostile turf — was often viewed negatively by parents in the ghettoes. And given the inevitable failure of school integration under racist capitalism, the new middle class had to give up on its illusions as well. So integrationism is dead as an ideology, even though its former champions — including Mfume, Jackson, Waters, Rangel and Bond — have not replaced it with any other defined middle-class outlook, aside from a vague pluralism. 
In 1995, the “Million Man March” led by Minister Farrakhan was one of the most massive events ever held in Washington. While the crowd was comparatively affluent, many poorer Black workers were attracted to the message of Black pride, assertion and self-organized unity that was woven into Farrakhan’s mixed message. Indeed, any other Black leader who called for reconciliation with the U.S. government and its “greatness” would have been labeled a Clarence Thomas. But Farrakhan got away with it because of his long history of anti-white and separatist rhetoric. 
Whither Farrakhan?
In saying that Clinton is in effect the leader of Black America, we mean that the post-integrationists are clearly no longer as authoritative or as independent in the eyes of the masses as in the past. With the Million Man March, Farrakhan moved to fill the vacuum. Because of his strong independent Black identification, he could rouse the community in a way that others no longer can. Thus he could force the post-integrationists to kowtow to him and thereby acknowledge that he has taken much of their base. 
But there is also evidence that he cannot accomplish any more in the leadership position than they could. Elijah Muhammad, the founder of the Nation of Islam (NOI), publicly decried Black participation in elections. Nevertheless, he always made NOI’s power a factor in the machine politics of his Chicago home base, but in a cloaked fashion. Today, the cloak is impossible. Farrakhan’s march loudly pushed voter registration, echoing the incessant calls from the post-integrationist leaders. In November 1998, the NOI pulled out all stops, including a motorcade parade and a rally in Chicago, in a campaign to boost the Black vote. The NOI’s Final Callminced no words that this meant support for the Democratic Party, locally and nationally. The response was underwhelming from Black workers and poor. 
Of course, Farrakhan makes clear that he’s not as tied to the Democrats as other Black leaders are. In fact, he openly calls for a Black “third force.” He says he wants to create a more independent electoral base, a new “political army” to carry out his economic program. He stresses Black petty capitalism, self-development and free enterprise, all of which have led him to laud a number of Republicans. But a formal link to the Republican Party is politically impossible. First, Farrakhan must appeal to Blacks who have moved upward by relying on the baby carrots doled out by the Democrats, and these “benefactors” will not buy a program which favors Black economic autonomy or anything besides the continuation of dependence on government power. Second, few Blacks are willing to buy the barely-shielded racism of the Republican right. So even though 
Farrakhan doesn’t rely on elected office, he cannot seriously challenge the Democrat party any more than can the liberal post-integrationists. He is freer to play games within the structure and to posture as an independent, but he has no political gains to show for it. 
Farrakhan’s impasse became clear when the impeachment threat against Clinton mounted. On television’s Meet the Presson October 16, he condemned Clinton’s “immorality” but pointed out that all presidents have been immoral. He concluded that Clinton was being “wickedly mistreated” and suggested that Monica Lewinsky was part of a Jewish/Zionist plot to nail him. He acknowledged his poor opinion of the Democrats, indicating that the Republicans are worse, but still emphatically urged Blacks to register to vote. He asserted that “something different must be done” — but couldn’t say what that is. 
Farrakhan bemoans the troubles that afflict America because it is such a “great nation.” But as a capitalist nation it will never allow Black people to escape their pariah status. That is the source of Farrakhan’s impasse, for rocking the capitalist boat is not his game. And even though he has had to ditch Elijah Muhammad’s electoral abstentionism (occasional rhetorical flourishes aside), he remains just as conservative in rejecting mass action. Most obviously, he rejects any idea of mass armed self-defense against the increasing police violence. Bourgeois to the core, he rejects any course that would allow the Black working class to formidably challenge racism or private property. He is condemned to electoral and Democratic Party answers when they don’t exist. 
Khallid Muhammad’s Pseudo-Militancy
As Farrakhan moved toward a more statesman-like role, his former lieutenant, Khallid Muhammad, made a move to out-militant him. Muhammad tries to give voice to the growing anger among Black youth. His clout with the nationalist groupings, both Muslim and secular, is based on his claimed ability to attract alienated young Blacks, a capacity they lack. His actual base, although hyped as a tie with the street gangs, is to be found more among disaffected Black middle-class college students. 
To a considerable extent, Khallid Muhammad has been able to make a bid for leadership among angry Blacks because of the attacks on him by prominent white politicians and the mainstream press. He obviously goes out of his way to press the right buttons that provoke the vituperation he feeds on. For example, he publicly embraced Colin Ferguson, the crazed gunman who indiscriminately shot and killed white people on the Long Island Rail Road a few years ago. And while other demagogues try to cloak their anti-Jewish rhetoric, Muhammad spews it out nakedly, gleefully escalating it in proportion to the reaction of the Jewish organizations and the white media. The fight between Muhammad and New York’s despicably racist Mayor Giuliani, which broke out last year over preparations for the “Million Youth March” (MYM), did a lot to enhance this reputation. 
You don’t have to live in Harlem to hate Giuliani. This arrogant demagogue used the MYM in September as an excuse to terrorize that community in a naked display of the armed power of the state. But defending the march from Giuliani’s attack in no way meant that we politically endorsed it. The march was comparatively small, but thousands of people did attend, for various reasons. But the march in fact was designed for one purpose
to build Khallid Muhammad. It did not represent a fighting movement, and those who came with such hopes could only be disappointed. 
Khallid Muhammad is bad news, unfortunately not for enemies like Giuliani but above all for Black people. First, Muhammad’s outlook is openly capitalist and commercial, even if it is more 125th Street than Wall Street. Anyone who reached the MYM’s Web site last summer faced a tidal wave of marketing data on its concessions and the sales potential of its young “targeted audience.” The MYM’s program vaguely called for jobs but mostly included standard nationalist dead-ends like the demand for reparations and Black business development. 
In contrast to Farrakhan, Khallid Muhammad is willing to talk about armed self-defense against police brutality and racist attacks. But his stance is dangerous demagogy, not an actual attempt to mobilize masses and organize them into disciplined military defense units. This was made evident at the Harlem rally. Contrary to Giuliani’s lies, Muhammad didn’t start a fight with the cops at the end of the affair. As he was winding up his closing speech, police detachments in riot gear made a clearly planned attack on the speakers’ platform. What Muhammad did was encourage the unorganized and unarmed crowd to confront the organized and armed cops to try to seize their weapons if attacked. After delivering this recipe for a massacre, which thankfully the crowd ignored, he disappeared. 
Muhammad is also no foe of the Democrats. An important fact that has generally been ignored is that, for all the fiery nationalist denunciations of the “white devil,” Jews and Giuliani from the podium, there was no denunciation of the white-run, imperialist Democratic Party! Harlem congressman Charles Rangel and a variety of other mainstream Black Democrats who were unhappy with Muhammad and the rally came under attack, but not Clinton. Al Sharpton, who aspires to be the Democratic nominee for mayor or senator in future elections, was a featured speaker. Baptist minister Rev. Calvin Butts, another prospective Democratic candidate, was a major endorser. The former head of Harlem’s NOI Temple No. 7, Conrad Muhammad, who was recently cast aside by Farrakhan, is another likely candidate for a local office. In fact, a good deal of the infighting around the MYM by various groups and local political figures behind the scenes concerned contests for control of the Democratic machine in Harlem. 
In the short run, Farrakhan remains the only Black leader with commanding clout nationally. However, as more middle-class professionals become angrier and as the prospects for small businesses dim even further, the more militant wing of reactionary nationalism can expect to grow. Muhammad seeks to forge his cadres among those militants. To that end, he has launched his own Muslim sect and the New Black Panther Party, a reactionary mirror-opposite to the original party which, despite its political faults, rejected religious obscurantism, despised cultural nationalism and proclaimed itself to be revolutionary socialist. 
Openly pro-capitalist nationalism like Muhammad’s appears militant mainly because of its radical anti-white posture. It can win some hearing among the working-class and poorer sections of Blacks, who do not live in isolation from the influence of the petty bourgeoisie and middle class. But the systemic nature of the attacks that workers and working-class youth are increasingly facing also means that their very real but unformulated anti-capitalist consciousness will accelerate. The question is, can this sentiment be translated into an organization and program for action that truly represents the interest of the Black working class and the masses as a whole? 
The Black Radical Congress: No “Alternative”
Earlier this summer another contender for Black leadership declared itself. Nearly two thousand Black leftists met in Chicago in June to launch the Black Radical Congress (BRC) as an alternative to Farrakhan and his ilk. The conference claimed to represent diverse progressive radical traditions among Black activists, “including socialism, revolutionary nationalism and feminism,” and its program spoke of the need to address the interests of the working class and the poor. In the face of the reactionary male-dominated family theme evoked by the religious and cultural nationalists, the BRC openly identified with women’s liberation and the rights of gays and lesbians. It explicitly rejected the Black capitalist path. Thus on the surface, the BRC appeared to be an avenue for advanced working-class Blacks looking for a challenge to pro-capitalist nationalism. But this was not to be. 
The Congress adopted an 11-point Principles of Unity document, whose preamble carefully noted that the BRC would not “replace or displace existing organizations, parties or campaigns” but would mobilize around “common concerns.” The principles are purposely vague as to how to achieve the BRC’s chief goal
to “strengthen radicalism as the legitimate voice of Black working and poor people, and to build organized resistance.” 
The conference itself stuck to this vagueness by treating contentious issues as threats to unity. Political and organizational disagreements were diverted from the floor to the leading continuations committee each time they came up. “Unity” was maintained, but at the expense of working out a specific radical strategy for Black liberation that is so desperately needed. None of this was accidental. 
Major roles in the BRC are played by the Committees of Correspondence (CoC) and the Communist Party (CP), both of which, in somewhat different ways, are proponents of the Democrats and the Congressional Black Caucus. But the days when the Stalinist CP or any group could singlehandedly dominate an event like the BRC conference are long gone
the sponsors included individuals and groups who at least nominally oppose the Democrats or who consider non-electoral actions important. Given this division, the BRC makes no explicit statement of support or opposition to the Democrats. This omission is supposedly in the interests of unity but in reality comes at the expense of political clarity. Thus there was no debate over the Democratic Party at a conference claiming to build a powerful radical alternative to the status quo. 
The BRC’s goal of unity precluded any open endorsement of Clinton or the Democrats. But in practice, by excluding the possibility of a radical campaign for a political alternative, it in effect accepts the present dead-end strategy of the pro-capitalist Black leadership and its Democratic Party orientation. 
This can already be seen in New York, in the wake of Giuliani’s imposition of virtual martial law in Harlem in response to the MYM. All the politicians and political groups in the Black community made proposals about how to respond; the New York BRC came up with a petition for the recall of the Republican mayor. Such a campaign, leading only to a new electoral alternative, is the most passive form of action imaginable. Leaving aside the feasibility of a recall, the present balance of political forces in the city means that it could only be a pro-Democratic Party maneuver. 
The Crisis of Leadership
Revolutionaries want to eradicate racism root and branch; we believe that for this to happen capitalism must be overthrown. Socialist revolution is the only way to end racism. Yet there is an absolute crisis of leadership for such a struggle, an abysmal misleadership of all the potential struggles of workers and poor. 
This crisis is not only in the Black community. The only existing leadership of the American working class is the trade union bureaucracy, which has proved itself a nightmare for workers of all colors. This article has cited the increasing alienation of Black workers from capitalist politics. But Latinos and the vast majority of white workers, unlike the most aristocratic layer that often identifies with U.S. imperialism and racism, are also at sea politically. There is an increasing contempt for capitalist politicians, labor bureaucrats and the like throughout the working class. What is missing is an alternative. 
This enormous crisis will be resolved only through enormous acts. Massive, united struggle is the means by which significant numbers of advanced workers can make a qualitative leap in building a new party of the working class and oppressed. For this to happen, an immediate fight for mass action must be coupled with an open struggle against the current misleaderships. It must be led by conscious revolutionaries determined to win their fellow workers to the work of forging a new leadership and strategy. 
How can this be done? A case in point came after Giuliani’s attack on Harlem, when the December 12 Movement and other radical Black groups called for a general strike. Their leaflet urged Blacks to not go to work, adding “don’t shop, don’t go to school.” But this attempt, long after the immediate anger had died down, failed to get support among Black workers. One reason was that it was hard to distinguish from the perennial calls by nationalists to boycott white-owned businesses. And, of course, a general strike can’t be launched by a leaflet or word of mouth alone. It requires the machinery of powerful organizations with large resources and memberships, like the unions. Power has to be fought with an opposing source of power. 
Imagine that, just when the anger in Harlem over the MYM events was at its highest, radicals had begun a campaign for a real mass mobilization. Suppose they had challenged the New York labor leaders to call a one-day general strike demanding a halt to the racist police assaults. Suppose they had called on the many anti-Giuliani ministers to mobilize their large working-class congregations to put pressure on the labor bureaucrats. Suppose they directly demanded that “progressive” labor bureaucrats like Dennis Rivera of 1199 support the call. Suppose they also challenged Black leaders like Louis Farrakhan, Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to support such a strike. 
Suppose also that radicals helped build committees for the general strike among militant workers, students and other youth, putting out a call to all workers who wanted to oppose police brutality — and Giuliani’s other racist attacks. Such a campaign, unlike the electoralist petition against Giuliani, could have made a difference. Given the widespread anger, the misleaders would have been forced to go along or would have been put on the spot. Either way, a step towards a new leadership would have been taken, and possibly a mass upheaval would have occurred. 
Blacks and Latinos are a decisive force in the big unions in New York. Even in a one-day strike, transport, production, services and the city government itself — the mayor notwithstanding — would grind to a halt. The impact would be tremendous. And it would open up a struggle which has been stifled by the labor bureaucracy and pro-capitalist misleaders of Blacks and the rest of the working class, for decades. Black, Latino and anti-racist white workers would be in the lead, demonstrating to less advanced workers that police brutality is their problem too — and that if they join with militant Black and Latino workers in fighting racism they will also be building the fight against the capitalist attacks. Workers, now cynical, would see their power. 
Mass action by the working class is considered by many leftists today to be an old-fashioned idea to be cherished only in labor history books and conferences. Indeed, the working class has changed since the historic labor battles of the 1930’s. For one thing, Black and Latino workers are now in a strategic position in both private and public workforces; they hold a power they did not have during the earlier periods of upheaval. They can now exercise decisive strength, as was already exhibited in the wave of wildcat strikes that Black workers led in factory after factory in the early 1970’s. At that time, white workers followed Black militants in important union battles — a new phenomenon that did not go unnoticed by the bosses. 
In response to those struggles the bosses have made conscious efforts to reduce the concentration of Black workers in key industries and locations. Layoffs have been one major tool, with more to come. But Black and Latino workers still wield powerful leverage because of their crucial role in production; their strength cannot be ignored when it is actually harnessed to fight the system. 
Revolutionary Program
We are trying to paint a true picture of the leading role that Black and Latino workers can play. But we don’t say that the struggles will automatically develop into the powerful united fight that is needed. Nor will politically advanced Black, Latino and anti-racist white workers automatically be granted leadership. None of this will come without preparation by a vanguard that adopts a revolutionary strategy from the start. 
One fact is glaring no present-day contender for leadership of the Black struggle is able to break with the Democratic Party. Thus Clinton rules over the Black community by default. Nevertheless, waning support for the Democrats among Black workers shows that openings already exist for building an alternative. 
The economic crisis is about to erupt with devastating fury upon the U.S. working class. History shows that Black and Latino workers will be hit the hardest. But white workers and the middle strata of all races will be smacked hard and also be looking for a way out. Inevitably, the ruling class will step up its attempt to divide the working class through an even more naked racist offensive. 
The capitalist strategy doesn’t have to succeed. History shows that not only Blacks and Latinos but white workers too will fight back against deepened exploitation. The question is whether advanced workers can show the way to a united — that is, a successful— fight. We do not know whether the next explosion will take the form of an upheaval against police brutality or other racist attacks, a resistance by workers against their bosses in industry, or another option. In any case, revolutionaries fight for the widest possible class unity. 
The reason we counterpose mass action to electoralism is that action is the way a vanguard layer will congeal as the working class discovers in living practice its own enormous strength. At this juncture, the initiative is in the hands of the capitalists and their agents; the working-class and the Black and Latino masses think of themselves as powerless, doomed to rely on politicians, preachers, presidents, demagogues and bureaucrats. Even revolutionary-minded workers have serious doubts about the Marxist class strategy, given the low level of struggle, the obvious racism of many white workers and the demoralization fostered by leaders accepting attacks for decades. To break from this malaise, mass actions like general strikes can teach more than just the advantage of unity. They give the class confidence in its struggle, they help it build its own trusted leadership and they educate the more backward workers so that they can be won over. 
In mass struggles, anti-racist and democratic demands like Stop Police Brutality! Stop Racist Attacks!are a key part of our program. In order to answer the immiseration of the working class, especially but not only in the Black and Latino communities, we champion the demands of Jobs for Alland Public Works.We absolutely reject the idea that Black, Latino and white workers should fight over a decreasing pool of jobs at a decreasing rate of pay, and that Black, Latino and white workers should put up with worsening hospitals, schools and housing. Workers in struggle should demand that society provide jobs for all its members, spreading the necessary work among the many people ready, willing and able to do it. If the capitalists say there are not enough jobs, we say create jobs — and we demand real jobs at good union wages to build the necessary schools, hospitals and homes, etc. This program begins to meet the workers’ needs and therefore shows that all workers have common goals. 
Workers know they have to fight for what they need. If capitalism claims it can’t provide what’s needed, that will prove that we must go on to fight for the workers’ society that can. In sum, we need to fight for socialist revolution. And that means organizing a revolutionary party. 
Racism can only be smashed if a revolutionary working-class party is built. To win over the many potential middle-class allies of the working class, the working class must champion a fight for all the needs of Blacks and Latinos. In particular, the revolutionary program must include a resolute defense of affirmative action and other gains important to the middle class and those who aspire to it. By making itself the tribune of all oppressed people against discrimination the working class can prove that its party is fit to lead. 
Black liberation is only possible through socialist revolution. This means that united action must be lead not by the elite but by the only class capable of making such a revolution, the proletariat. Once Black and Latino workers again go into mass motion, they will discover that reality in practice. And there is no doubt that Black and Latino workers will be found in the leadership of the revolution in far greater numbers than their proportion in the American population. The majority of whites too will become conscious of their material interests and the reality that racism is the profound enemy of all workers.

Self-Determination and Military Defense: The Marxist Method

Proletarian Revolution59, (Summer 1999)
 Transcribed, Edited and Formatted by Damon Maxwell and David Walters in 2008 for the Encyclopedia of Trotskyism On-Line.

In the United States and several other countries, racism is the scourge of the working class. In many other places, like the Balkans, national oppression plays a similar role: it is used by demagogues to set working people at each others’ throats, to prevent a united working class from confronting the capitalists in a powerful class struggle that could put and end to oppression and exploitation once and for all. 
In this epoch of imperialism, capitalism only survives because of its ability to oppress, divide and superexploit. That is why understanding the communist strategy to end national oppression is a vital necessity for every working-class person.
LENIN ON SELF-DETERMINATION
The key Marxist theory on the national question was developed by Vladimir Lenin, the founder of the Bolshevik Party and leader of the Russian revolution of 1917. Lenin fought both political opponents and even his own comrades to establish that defense of the right of national self-determination was a central plank in the communist platform.
Self-determination means the right of an oppressed nationality to secede from the state that rules over it and either create its own independent nation-state or join another nation-state. It is a bourgeois-democratic right, but it is denied by pre-capitalist rulers and by the imperialist powers in capitalism’s epoch of decay. 
    
Lenin’s major aim was unity of the working class within national boundaries and between advanced and colonized countries. As a general rule, he didn’t advocate  actual secession: that depended on the concrete situation. A Marxist centralist to the core, he stressed the advantages of large states with integrated industrial and financial ties. Nevertheless, if the proletariat was to win the colonial masses to its side, oppressed nations’ right  to secede had to be defended.
Lenin also stressed that revolutionary consciousness and national chauvinism are incompatible. Defense by communists of the rights of oppressed peoples was also a vital element in fighting chauvinism in the working classes of the imperialist countries. 
Thus, in the course of their struggle, the workers and peasants in the oppressed countries would see that workers in the imperialist country were their allies, and that their nationalist bourgeoisie—not just the imperialists—was their enemy. Advancing the right of self-determination could open up the class struggle within the oppressed country, so that the indigenous capitalists could no longer hide their own exploitative role behind the obvious exploitation and political domination by the imperialists.      
After the Bolshevik revolution and the wider horizon it created for anti-colonial struggles across the world, Lenin looked more favorably on independence as the way forward in Asia and Africa; it was a path to internationalist unity of the toilers in the struggle against imperialism. 
Like Marx, Lenin saw the nation as a historically necessary and progressive step in the development of capitalism. Prior to the First World War, he emphasized the need for oppressed nations to overcome pre-capitalist barriers. Consolidation of bourgeois nation-states would allow the widest possible range and the greatest stability for accumulation of capital and the further development of the forces of production, including the working class itself. A stage was necessary in which the proletariat would fight for self-determination as part of a struggle for consistent democracy.
However, such a stage was never an end in itself. The class struggle remained the dominant issue, determining whether defense of self-determination was appropriate in a given situation. Lenin urged an alliance of the proletariat in the developed capitalist countries with the masses in the colonies and semi-colonies initially led by bourgeois nationalists. Proletarian revolution in the developed countries, which were potentially capable of producing abundance sooner than the underdeveloped lands, was the key aim. But the brewing revolutions in the colonial world could prove decisive in smashing the global grip of the reactionary bourgeois system which had spread everywhere. 
THE EPOCH OF DECAY
With the outbreak of World War I, Lenin concluded that capitalism had entered into its epoch of decay—an epoch of revolution and the transition to socialism, but also of counterrevolution and imperialist wars for re-dividing the world. The chief barrier facing the working class was no longer pre-capitalist feudalism but capitalist imperialism. The productive forces in the advanced countries—above all, the proletariat—were now mature enough so that capitalism was fully ripe for socialist revolution; potential abundance could be spread across the world. 
Lenin continued to stress the importance of the struggle for bourgeois-democratic rights as a means by which, over time, the whole bourgeois era in human development could be transcended by socialist revolution. However, the idea of the democratic struggle as a separate stage gave way more and more to the primacy of the socialist revolution as a means to carry out the democratic demands, thus laying the basis for the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. For example, in 1915 he wrote a passage that comes close to Trotsky’s theory of permanent revolution:
We must combine the revolutionary struggle against capitalism with a revolutionary program and tactics on all democratic demands: a republic, a militia, the popular election of officials, equal rights for women, the self-determination of nations, etc. While capitalism exists, these demands—all of them—can only be accomplished as an exception, and even then in an incomplete or distorted form. Basing ourselves on the democracy already achieved, and exposing its incompleteness under capitalism, we demand the overthrow of capitalism, the expropriation of the bourgeoisie, as a necessary basis both for the abolition of the poverty of the masses and for the complete and all-round institution of all democratic reforms. (The Revolutionary Proletariat and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination, Collected Works , Vol. 21.)
The fight for the right to self-determination, as for other democratic demands, was meant to free, educate and politically unify the proletariat—outside of the oppressed nation as well as within. In the course of the struggle, and with the guidance of Marxists, the limits of capitalism would become apparent. The proletariat developing within the colonial and semi-colonial lands, led by the already mature working classes of the advanced capitalist countries, could choose the road to socialist revolution. The fight for democracy and equality was also a means to win the support of the peasantry, a critical factor especially in the colonies and semi-colonies. 
Since socialism was now on the international agenda, the national development of capitalism in the colonized world through anti-colonial struggles was now only relatively  progressive. No longer was it necessary for human progress that nascent capitalists have a sheltering nation-state to enable them to grab a larger share in the exploitation of the workers and peasants at home.  
In contrast to the national bourgeoisies, for the masses nationalism meant achieving the better conditions they saw the imperialist nationals enjoy. But economically unviable nations produced by imperialist domination could not possibly create such equality. Therefore communists had to stress their opposition to the trap of nationalism itself. They had to expose the contradiction between the nationalism of the bourgeoisie and the transient nationalism of the masses, so that its opposite, internationalist consciousness, could grow.
The anti-colonial revolutions could link up with socialist working classes in the West through a joint struggle against the common enemy, imperialism. Lenin saw national independence as a political  goal that could be achieved by colonial peoples. That was one of his disagreements with Rosa Luxemburg on the national question. He agreed with her that genuine economic  independence was impossible in the epoch of imperialism; new bourgeois nation-states were not viable as means toward real independence. For Lenin, any fleetingly progressive significance retained by nationalist sentiment among the colonial masses was due to the fact that this was the form of their political awakening.
The right of an oppressed people to self-determination is a principle. But for Marxists, all bourgeois-democratic rights are subordinate to the overriding principle of the international working-class revolutionary struggle. Principles are of course not transhistorical or immutable; but when they are subordinated, that can only be for a moment in time and with due preparation for the fact that the step will have consequences to guard against.
INTERNATIONALISM VS. NATIONALISM
To sum up, Lenin saw the defense of the right to self-determination as a principled programmatic weapon, designed to help achieve revolutionary socialist consciousness. In situations where independence was desirable, Lenin initially thought that the development of new bourgeois national states was progressive in comparison with pre-capitalist conditions. Later, as the new epoch developed, he stressed that nationalist consciousness in colonial countries was progressive in the passing sense that it awakened political awareness among the masses of the need to fight the common enemy of imperialism. 
These views never made Lenin a nationalist, no more than supporting bourgeois national development versus feudalism made Marx a capitalist or a nationalist. Marx and Lenin only gave transient support to national movements, even when they saw them as necessary and progressive. They were only a means to their real and explicit goal, proletarian internationalism. 
For Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky, defense of the right to self-determination was ultimately a means to strip away and expose every alien class force and every pro-bourgeois answer to the yearning of the masses for equality and a decent life. Only the proletarian-led socialist revolution could solve the desperate problems which beset humanity. 
In the broadest but most basic sense, therefore, the Bolsheviks wielded the weapon of national self-determination to achieve a fundamentally anti-nationalist  goal. It was a means to convince masses that nationalism and nation-building fundamentally were dead-ends, and that the proletarian socialist revolution was the true answer. The line between the democratic aspirations of the masses and the nationalist goals of the bourgeois misleaders was sometimes difficult to draw in actual struggles, yet it was absolutely vital to do so. 
Lenin and Trotsky at the dawn of the 20th century were assimilationists (integrationists), like Marx and Engels before them. (Marx, for example, had urged the Czechs to abandon the vestiges of their separate language and culture and become German.) In East Europe and elsewhere, new nationalities were being formed within the borders of various states. As centralists, they hoped that the new states would be as large and inclusive as possible, congealing the myriads of infinitely sub-divided minuscule groupings of people that existed throughout the Balkans and Slavic East Europe. The process of bourgeois revolutionary development demanded that national states homogenize these dispersed peoples into more uniform nations, as had been done in Western Europe.
The Marxists’ centralist goal remained in the new epoch of imperialism, even when detours to get there had to be taken. Advocating the right to national self-determination was not meant to create a multitude of nation-states but rather to prove to the oppressed masses that the proletariat of the dominant countries defended their rights. Only that defense made internationalist working-class unity possible.
WHAT IS A NATION?
Self-determination is the right of an oppressed nationality to secede; other democratic rights pertain to oppressed non-national groups. But what is a nation?
The terms we use today to describe various peoples have altered over time. Race, nation, nationality and caste had certain separate meanings but were also used interchangeably by ordinary people along with scholars and Marxists. Marx even referred to the proletariat as a race upon occasion. Lenin and Trotsky both pointed, as another example, to the German nation, meaning the nationality, and to the German race, meaning the same thing. In one essay on self-determination, Lenin refers to the Jewish people in Poland as a caste—and a few pages later as a nation. Yet he was opposed to the right of self-determination for Jews because they were not a separate nation from either the Polish or the Russian nation.
It would be a mistake to dismiss the interchangeability of the terms our forebears used as a simple matter of confusion or imprecision—although that element existed. Reality itself was imprecise. Race/racism and nation/national chauvinism were creations of early capitalism. (See our pamphlet Marxism, Interracialism and the Black Struggle .) The congealing of various groups of people under those rubrics was far from complete in most of the world—in the minds both of the people concerned and of observers. Marxists did not decide in advance that such groups would inevitably harden into the specific nations, races, castes, ethnicities and nationalities that we know today. The relative hardening coincided with the unfolding of imperialism as the new epoch developed.
Under Lenin’s tutelage, Stalin gave what later became regarded as the classic Marxist definition of a nation: a historically evolved stable community of language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a community of culture.&& Trotsky also subscribed to this definition. But such a definition must be taken as a model, an abstraction; it was a vital norm if the reality of the process of nation-building was to be understood. The historically unfolding process could not be frozen in time by a definition. The most important concrete question was the developing consciousness of the particular people. Did an oppressed people see the territory that they lived on as their national homeland? For example, Jews living in the Pale did not regard that territory as their specific homeland but as part of Poland where they had lived since the 13th century. 
In the late 1930’s Trotsky advanced the idea of historically developed consciousness as the basis for determining whether Blacks in the American South were to become a nation. He expected a national consciousness to emerge when the massive struggle that he predicted broke out. His method, rooted in the Russian experience, was correct, even though his actual understanding of the consciousness and the future direction of Black people in the Black Belt was wrong.   
TERRITORIAL CONSCIOUSNESS
In sum, 1) to determine that applicability of self-determination rights, a concrete understanding of a group’s territorial consciousness and the likely direction of political events is necessary; 2) we cannot fatalistically assume that an oppressed group will or should develop national consciousness.
To further illustrate these points, we can look at the colonial revolutions after World War II, which raised the question of self-determination for several emerging African states where national identification was weak. In many African countries, as in India, there was no common language or culture. Yet the divisions imperialism had created were real. A degree of economic and political integration existed within the specific countries; coupled to the broad historical trends, this led to a certain national consciousness. That, plus a Marxist assessment of the overall direction of the international class struggle, dictated our defense of the right to self-determination for the national liberation struggles. 
Within these post-colonial nations, of course, there were many ethnic differences. It would have been wrong, however (with certain limited exceptions), to accept these differences as a legitimate basis for separate nations; that would have played directly into the hands of the imperialists. Imperialism attempted, often successfully, to divide and conquer the oppressed by playing on differences that existed but were not fatalistically determined to fulfill themselves in the minds of the peoples themselves.
THE CASE OF KOSOVO
Coming late to capitalism with a severely deformed bourgeois revolutionary development, the Balkan region, like Africa and India, is far more atomized linguistically and culturally than the West. In the absence of revolutionary internationalism, the atomization process has now re-emerged—and in Western Europe as well. In the Balkans too, while it is necessary to defend the rights of oppressed peoples, a carte-blanche policy of self-determination for every tiny group could only exacerbate unnecessary splits in the proletariat. Worse, if such a policy were extended to a non-oppressed people, its effects would be devastating.  
We stand firmly for the right of self-determination for oppressed nations—where that nationhood is determined by history and the development of the people’s conscious attachment to a given nationally-understood territory. For example, the national consciousness of the Kosovars is clear, whether or not they prefer an independent Kosovo or unity with Albania. For most of the period since the Great Powers awarded Kosovo, with its Albanian majority, to the Serbian kingdom rather than to Albania in the diplomatic haggling during the Balkan Wars of 1912-13, Serbia has ruled oppressively over the Albanian Kosovars. As an illustration, Leon Trotsky, then a war correspondent, wrote in 1913:
The Bulgars in Macedonia, the Serbs in Old Serbia, in their national endeavor to correct data in the ethnographical statistics that are not quite favorable to them, are engaged quite simply in systematic extermination of the Muslim population ... . (The Balkan Wars , p. 286.) 
National self-determination for the Kosovo Serbs, on the other hand, does not apply, for they are not an oppressed people but rather part of the Serbian nation as a whole. Marxists, of course, defend the democratic and human rights of the Serbian minority within an independent or Albanian Kosovo. But arguments that Kosovo is traditionally Serbian&& are both false historically and irrelevant to the consciousness of the vast majority of the population. And they feed into imperialism’s divisive manipulation.
During the Kosovo war, some on the left argued that the Albanians’ capitulation to NATO had invalidated Kosovo’s right to national self-determination. The Spartacist League is most explicit. They declared that they had defended the Kosovars’ right to form an independent state—until the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army ... became nothing but a pawn of NATO imperialism’s war aims. (Workers Vanguard , April 2.) While this would be a legitimate reason to deny military support to the KLA, denying the right of the people to self-determination is something entirely different.
Trying to give its rejection of self-determination a Marxist pedigree, the Spartacists claimed that Lenin had denied Poland’s right to secede from Tsarist Russia during the First World War: In the context of inter-imperialist war, Lenin rightly argued that calls for Poland’s independence only served as a democratic cover for German imperialism. (Workers Vanguard , May 28.)
This is a typical Spartacist distortion. Lenin in fact warned that Polish nationalist calls for independence during the war served imperialism, both German and Russian. He urged Polish socialists to work for the unity of the proletarian struggle in both small and big countries without putting forward the slogan of Polish independence for the given epoch or the given period. But he added that Russian and German socialists would remain internationalists ... by demanding for Poland unconditional freedom to secede (The Discussion on Self-Determination Summed Up , July 1916.)
The Spartacists believe that in order to defend a people’s right to self-determination, Marxists must also agree with their choice of independence. Lenin’s effort to separate the mass base from the nationalist misleaders thus becomes simply a means to tail those misleaders. And when the Spartacists don’t agree, they abandon defense of the democratic right, which inevitably leads to tailing the oppressors. Indeed, that was Lenin’s point when he vehemently argued during the war for the Poles’ (and others’) right to self-determination. Here is one of several examples:
If the socialists of Britain do not recognize and uphold Ireland’s right to secession, if the French do not do the same for Italian Nice, the Germans for Alsace-Lorraine, Danish Schleswig and Poland, the Russians for Poland, Finland, the Ukraine, etc., and the Poles for the Ukraine—if all the socialists of the Great Powers, i.e., the great robber powers, do not uphold that right in respect of the colonies, it is solely because they are in fact imperialists, not socialists. (The Question of Peace, July-August 1915.)
The same can be said of American socialists who do not uphold Kosovo’s right to independence, especially since that right is denied today by U.S. imperialism.  
MILITARY SUPPORT
Self-determination is rarely granted by imperialism without the threat of a fierce struggle, political and military. When the national struggle is controlled by bourgeois or petty-bourgeois leaderships, precise tactics are necessary. Leninists use the tactic of military-technical support in defense of a non-communist leadership fighting the same oppressor. This can involve enabling that leadership to get arms and other tactical aid from any source it can. That is, for a moment in time, each for their own reasons, communists and non-communists aim their guns (literally or figuratively) not at each other but at a common enemy.
Military support to a non-working-class leadership means that we have no political agreement with it. Leninists have given military support over the century to the Russian counterrevolutionary socialist Kerensky against the Tsarist General Kornilov, to the reactionary Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie against Italian imperialism, to the murderous Chiang Kaishek in China against Japanese imperialism, to the bloodthirsty General Galtieri of Argentina against the British imperialists, and to the criminal Saddam Hussein against U.S./U.N. imperialism—to name only a handful of enemies of the working class who for a historical moment were forced to fight on the right side. Likewise, we can, at appropriate times, give military support to the KLA or to Milosevic’s regime against the momentarily dominant oppressor. They are nothing more than the masses’ unwilling and very temporary allies.
Since military support in the sense described implies no political agreement, we sometimes refer to our policy as military but no political support.&& For that reason, in general we do not call for a military victory&& by non-proletarian elements if that would imply support for their taking state power or for their war aims. The importance of this distinction may be seen again in the example of the Spartacists, who called for the military victory  of the FMLN in El Salvador, advocating state power for a class-collaborationist front; we advocated only military support , for the defeat of imperialism. (See PR  14.)  The tailist Spartacists effectively endorsed a popular front coalition trying to win state power from the pro-imperialist regime. Genuine Marxists reject class collaboration and give no political support to any capitalist government. 
In some other situations, like the war between NATO and Serbia, we did call for military victory over the imperialists—because here the term implied only defeat of the imperialists and not the raising of a new bourgeois contender to state power. Victory might result in keeping Milosevic in power, but especially given the political divisions in Serbia, that was not guaranteed nor was it our intention. (Our support for Kosovar self-determination was clearly in opposition to Milosevic’s war aims.)
It may be that for lack of resources we can offer no actual military or technical support. Then the slogan becomes a propaganda statement, a means to begin to convince enough workers of our method so that in the future more tangible offers of military assistance will be possible.
We emphasize that we give military support when the treacherous misleadership in question is actually fighting the oppressors. We support only those military blows which are struck against the common enemy. As Trotsky pointed out in advocating military support for the bourgeois Republic against Franco’s fascists in the Spanish Civil War, we know that many of the weapons sent may be used against us and the masses. But in the acute situation which demands our aid, we have no choice but to take a very real risk. 
There are specific circumstances, like those in which the Bolsheviks gave military defense to Kerensky’s Provisional Government, where the misleaders are not actually fighting the enemy but where we give such support. A crucial feature of the military support tactic, as with the defense of self-determination, is to expose false leaderships to their base in the masses. The Bolsheviks’ military defense actually served to show the workers of Petrograd that they and not the Provisional Government defended the masses and their soviets. 
Use of military support has become more frequent in the post-World War II period. The world proletariat suffered mass defeats because of social democratic and Stalinist betrayals, including the suppression of the post-war working-class revolts. Therefore workers have had to face revolutions of the oppressed generally led by pro-capitalist misleaderships; military support has been one important tactical means of intervening in self-determination struggles. 
PROBLEMS OF MILITARY SUPPORT
Given the nature of the leaderships of national struggles, they may make deals with imperialism. It is then necessary to assess whether it is the imperialists who determine the results of the struggle. For example, although Cuba received aid from Russia and was economically tied to its imperialism, the balance of concrete relations between the two on the world scene did not allow the USSR to treat Cuba as a semi-colonial pawn. Therefore, when U.S. imperialism attempted to invade Cuba in 1961 (and in all its subsequent attacks), we stood for the defense of Cuba and the defeat of the U.S. The same was true in the U.S. war against Vietnam. Likewise, although the ANC in South Africa received concrete support from  a number of European imperialist powers, we did not drop our military support for the struggle against apartheid. 
MILITARY SUPPORT IN KOSOVO
Still, some situations do demand the withdrawal of military support—when the leadership has effectively subordinated its struggle to the goals of an imperialist bloc. That was the case with the Bosnian leadership in 1995 (see PR  50), and with the Kosovo Albanian leadership (both Rugova and the KLA) against the Serbian regime. Our organization originally gave military support to the KLA in the fight against national oppression by the Serb regime. (PR  57.) We withdrew support at the point when the KLA effectively became NATO’s auxiliaries. 
It remained necessary, however, to support the military defense of the Kosovar people against Serbian ethnic cleansing. We also allowed for military support to KLA forces that were specifically defending civilians from Serb attacks. Not to do so would have meant joining the side of oppression. But since there were no anti-Serb armed forces not subordinated to NATO and imperialism, we stood for the general military defense of the Serb forces against the KLA while the KLA was fighting on NATO’s side. Sometimes in battle the distinction is far from clear, but Marxists must learn how to make such concrete determinations.
In some situations, there are different organizations claiming the leadership of the masses. If there is more than one leadership which could be given concrete military or technical aid, naturally our aid would go to working-class organizations if they exist. In the Nicaraguan struggle against the U.S.-backed contras , we advocated sending aid to Nicaragua’s trade unions rather than to the bourgeois Sandinista government. (PR  25.) If such organizations do not exist, we favor aiding groups whose struggle is objectively the most concretely hurtful to imperialism. In the Angolan revolt against Portuguese imperialism in 1975, we militarily supported the MPLA rather than to UNITA (see Socialist Voice  No. 1). This choice was not based on any political agreement but an estimate that the MPLA was moving toward real struggles against imperialism at the time. 
Military support is a limited tactic; defense of the right of self-determination is both a tactic on a grand scale—and a principle. Tactics on the battlefield of class warfare are generally variable and flexible. Principles are guides to action, not abstract moralisms hewn in stone for eternity. Nevertheless, history has shown that they should only be violated rarely—and that even then, with great caution and open warnings that the consequences are highly risky. 
    
In broad outline, what governs our willingness to extend military support in self-determination struggles is the state and direction of the overall international class struggle against imperialism. Above all, we determine our tactics and principles—and when and if to apply them—with reference to our fundamental strategic aim of socialist revolution. Does the act enhance our ability to defend our class and to raise its consciousness in the oppressed and oppressor nations, in the region and throughout the world? In sum, does it help re-create the vanguard of proletarian consciousness, the authentic Fourth International?

Twenty Years of the LRP

In 1976 a small number of comrades founded the League for the Revolutionary Party. It is no secret that the past twenty years have been hard times for all those who call themselves communists. Today however, we look backward upon our accomplishments with tremendous pride. And, most importantly, we eagerly look forward to the coming days with even greater confidence than we had to begin with.
Jim Cannon, the leader of the original U.S. Trotskyists, spoke of the early time when they were almost totally isolated by the strength of the Communist Party, which under the orders of Stalin had just expelled them. He referred to that period as the “dog days.” In contrast, the LRP—today’s Trotskyists—has had its “dog years.” Our organization was born at the beginning of a historic decline in the class struggle in the U.S., during which reformist leaders kept a tight grip on the masses, beating them into cynical passivity. 
While we have recognized political errors as well as missed opportunities, altogether they are only a minor reason for our inability to break out of isolation. The real barrier has been the nature of the period we have gone through. Oppressive circumstances still affect us, but the cracks in the encircling walls are beginning to widen appreciably. Mass struggles are on the horizon.
Assessing Our History
Trotsky taught us to have little patience with those who judged an organization by size alone. Such people, he said, had only achieved trade union consciousness, not revolutionary consciousness. The decisive question in evaluating a political organization is the power and relevance of its political ideas. If our politics actually reflect the real interests of the working class and point out the road ahead, then with the necessary initiative and courage the numbers will come.
The past twenty years have witnessed the collapse of leftist organizations of far greater size and power than the LRP. Some have simply died. Others survived organizationally as husks, but have surrendered the aspects of revolutionary politics that once animated them. 
In addition to newer comrades, a large percentage of the original cadres of the LRP are still with us, certainly as compared to other groups. Leftists whose standard for judgment is sheer activism tend to burn out and leave the movement quickly. We retain a toehold in industry when many others surrendered theirs. Comrades endured because our political ideas not only provided an accurate guideline to what was happening in the world over and again, but they were so clearly the ideas of authentic Marxism. 
Our political program has always been starkly clear, and it remains so to this day: the LRP stands for proletarian socialist revolution. We are uncompromising in our interracialism and internationalism, making the struggle to re-create the Fourth International our most important task. We have made these clarion calls the center of our everyday work, not the usual leftist holiday incantations. 
Of course, communism demands a high level of activity. Armchair theorists are worthless, because Marxism learns its lessons and finds real proof of its positions only in practice; its entire reason for existence is to help carry on the living class struggle. The party’s ability to lead its class can only be developed by these means. This requires the most careful attention to theory and analysis before, during and after active intervention. As Lenin observed, there can be no revolutionary practice without revolutionary theory.
Given the course of the class struggle over two decades, we have had only limited opportunities to participate in strikes, mass demonstrations and other working-class actions; but we have tried to take advantage of each. Our trade union work has been restricted to a handful of unions; but in those unions our supporters have a long record of open revolutionary work against the bosses and the bureaucracy. Our efforts at fighting to give direction to working-class student movements are well known but likewise restricted to a few locations. Knowing that capitalism is teaching yet another generation of Black, Latino, immigrant and women workers that oppression and superexploitation are its everyday weapons, the LRP has thrown itself into struggles against racism, chauvinism and sexism. We take pride not only in the amount of work that we have done for our small numbers but also in its political quality—and how much we have taught others and learned ourselves from these experiences.
Our Origins
In 1975-6, the Revolutionary Socialist League expelled its internal political minority, the Revolutionary Party Tendency, for its efforts to keep the RSL on a revolutionary course. Inside the RSL we had been subjected to a sustained anti-democratic attack which substituted lies and organizational restrictions for political argument. The Central Committee majority not only banned all members from reading our main document but suddenly ordered the end to the political discussion itself. After inventing a constantly changing series of charges, they threw out first our leaders and then all of us. (For an assessment of our fight, see  Socialist Voice No. 1.)
In February 1976 we launched the LRP. Even though we knew that the utterly bureaucratic way that the expulsions were conducted stemmed from the fact that the RSL could not successfully deal with our political positions, our spirits were not lifted. Instead, it would be fair to say that our mood was that of grim resolution. The fact that the RSL had abandoned the revolutionary road was a tragic defeat. The bizarre character of the expulsions that signalled this desertion and defeat stood in counterpoint to the enthusiasm that had accompanied the formation of the RSL.
The RSL had been born out of a split in the International Socialists in 1973. The IS at that time was composed of both left Shachtmanites and followers of Tony Cliff, the leader of the British IS (now the Socialist Workers Party). The IS, as opposed to the other political groupings in the United States and around the world who claimed a heritage in Trotskyism, believed that Russia and the rest of the Stalinist nations were not degenerated and deformed workers’ states. ISers either claimed that these states were a new “bureaucratic collectivist” form of society, neither capitalist nor socialist; or else they held a very similar view that it was a totally new stage in the development of capitalism. Both views saw the Stalinist states as reactionary but as superseding traditional capitalism. 
With the ebb of the 1960’s student movement, the IS had thrown itself into the working class and built up a considerable presence in major trade unions. As such it was centrally affected by the enormous working class explosions of the late ‘60’s and early ‘70’s. In the wake of the massive French general strike in 1968, country after country around the world followed suit with massive proletarian uprisings. In the U.S., revolts ripped through the ghettoes and wildcat strikes broke out in a rising crescendo across the country. One by-blow was the split in the IS in 1973 out of which emerged the RSL, taking nearly half the membership. 
Against Rank and Filism
In the fight against the IS right wing, we predicted that their work in building reformist “rank and file caucuses” in the unions, in which revolutionary politics were never to be raised, would inevitably lead the IS to align itself with mildly left bureaucrats. Today, the Solidarity group, which descended from the old IS, has openly abandoned even the pretence of Leninism and rests comfortably in the back pocket of Ron Carey of the Teamsters, Jerry Tucker of the Autoworkers and the like. They have even crossed the class line to endorse the bourgeois reformer Ralph Nader for U.S. president.
The RSL at its birth was tremendously energized. At last, we felt, there would be an organization which fought for an open revolutionary alternative to the bureaucrats; a group committed to the reconstruction of the revolutionary party in the U.S. and the rebuilding of a genuine Trotskyist Fourth International around the world. As opposed to the flotsam and jetsam of the centrist far left, the RSL fought for Marx’s idea that the working class itself could achieve revolutionary consciousness, build its own party and free itself and the world from capitalism. Authentic communist consciousness was no gift from condescending saviors.
Consequently, we rejected the cynical IS views of Stalinist Russia, both of which, rhetoric aside, dismissed the working class as the revolutionary agency undermining that system. In the RSL, we began to evolve the theory of Stalinism as statified capitalism. We rejected the degenerated and deformed workers’ state theories of the mainline pseudo-Trotskyists. Whatever errors in theory Trotsky made in his analysis of the USSR in the late 1930’s, he never believed that counterrevolutionary anti-proletarian Stalinists could make the socialist revolution and build workers’ states—the position adopted by the post-World War II pseudo-Trotskyists after contemplating the spread of Stalinism to East Europe and parts of Asia. It is not by accident that today so many of these epigones amicably share the Solidarity group with the former ISers.
In the early 1970’s, the mortal crisis of capitalism returned dramatically to the surface of events. The bourgeoisie began its offensive against all the gains made by the working class and the former colonial peoples around the world. In the U.S., the 1973-5 economic recession hit workers hard, and the labor bureaucracy was successful in isolating strikes and diverting the workers toward the Democrats and electoral non-answers. Thus, the working class and the oppressed minorities were set up for the massive retreat in the face of the capitalist attack that is still going on to this day.
This containment of the class struggle had its impact on the far left, driving groups to the right. Cynicism, above all about the role of the proletariat, deepened. In the RSL the leadership declared that the workers’ struggle in the coming years would be confined to “trade union and democratic demands.” This was not just a prediction but an announcement that the RSL would abandon raising the need for revolution as the class goal and conform to a reform perspective.

Against Labor Partyism
Not by accident, the RSL crystallized its position on calling for a labor party in the U.S., thus joining with the rest of the pseudo-Trotskyist milieu in a parody of the position adopted by Trotsky in the late ‘30’s. In our faction fight, we pointed out that Trotsky had put forward the idea of such a party to a militant working class which had just created the CIO industrial unions and, facing an impasse, had to broaden its struggle to the political arena. Addressing these millions of fighting workers, it was impossible to be sectarian and just say “join us, the small Trotskyist party,”—these workers wanted a party that reflected the enormous power shown by their mass struggles. He argued that we, like them, want a mass independent workers’ party; therefore we call for it.
However, because we do not want a reformist party, we put forward our transitional program of class-wide policies that inexorably point to revolution but are also desired by workers who believe they can be achieved through reforms. Fighting side by side with the mass of workers and discussing the lessons of the struggle, we could win them to the idea of a revolutionary party, which we always advocate openly.
For Trotsky, the labor party demand was a tactic applicable under particular conditions. For the RSL and the rest it had become a permanent strategy, good for all situations. To raise it at a time when the working class was in retreat could only mean creating a reformist party or a playtoy for leftish bureaucrats. The RSL had adopted the manipulative idea of stagism—today a reformist party not created by working-class mass action but by the bureaucrats, tomorrow a revolutionary party. Under that scheme tomorrow never comes. Reformism, according to Bolsheviks, is a counterrevolutionary trap and not a step toward revolution. Thus the RSL, we pointed out, was heading toward capitulation.
The predictions we made twenty years ago have been more than proved. The bankruptcy of this labor party policy has been illuminated garishly by the Labor Party founding convention described in our last issue. The RSL, seven times our size at the time of the expulsion, disintegrated and finally disappeared. The times tested its cadre and its politics and found both corrupted, as we had predicted.
Internationalism and Interracialism
The adaptation of the various left groups to reformism via rank and filism and labor partyism reflects the conservative prejudices of the privileged middle class and aristocratic upper layers of the working class. The LRP recognized early that a healthy revolutionary organization pays special attention to the most oppressed and exploited layers of the working class. These layers’ conditions show the future of the whole of the working class; thus the historic interests of the working class are represented by the immediate interests of the most oppressed.
In the United States, this has meant paying special attention to the oppression of Black people, which has been an indispensable weapon of American capitalism. It has increasingly become the model for ruling classes around the world seeking to divide and weaken their own working classes.
From the beginning, the LRP concentrated on elaborating its interracialist strategy as an essential accompaniment to Marxist internationalism. The concept of proletarian interracialism was developed in response to the ghetto rebellions of the late 1960’s and early 1970’s. Those uprisings were the source of the real gains Blacks wrested from capitalism. Not only did the “inner city” workers and unemployed challenge the U.S. state; they also exposed Martin Luther King’s pacifist integrationism as a blind alley. Likewise, their acts sharply contrasted with the Nation of Islam’s combination of militant rhetoric with social passivity. 
Capitalism in this epoch demands the superexploitation of oppressed workers; it can tolerate neither color-blind equality nor a separate Black national economy. Proletarian interracialism is rooted in the idea that genuine liberation and real equality can only be achieved through socialist revolution. It champions the right of Blacks to have their own independent organizations as a necessary step in the re-creation of an interracial working-class vanguard party.
Stalinism and Predictions
A party that cannot foresee the general course of world events gives fair evidence that it is not a Marxist party. No one can predict with exact timing every sequence of actual occurrences. However, seeing the general direction of society is both necessary and possible for communists. Without this, no revolutionary strategy is possible. All individuals and all groups, no matter how well armed politically, make mistakes. The decisive question is how well they learn from their mistakes by testing them constantly against reality and come closer to approximating the course of coming events.
We know of no other group calling itself Marxist which predicted the direction Stalinism would turn. In the first issues of this magazine, we observed that the USSR, while strong militarily, was weak economically; the Stalinist countries were crippled by the system’s inability to eliminate all the gains of the working class made as a result of the October revolution. We predicted that the crumbling Stalinist economies would have to adopt the more traditional capitalist forms, like privatization and the market, to intensify their exploitation of the workers. We also indicated that they could go only part way in decentralizing economies, given the dominant centralizing and concentrating tendencies at work in all forms of capitalist society, especially in this epoch.
Internationally, despite the obvious hostilities, Stalinism was far more a prop for Western imperialism than a serious economic rival. At the height of the Cold War, we wrote that in all probability a future hot war would occur among the U.S., Japan and Germany; not centered on a struggle between the U.S. and the USSR. 
We were laughed at by the left when we made these predictions. No one laughs now. Events in the East have confirmed our projections. The mainline pseudo-Trotskyist theory, in contrast, foresaw nothing. The momentous events culminating in 1989-91 took all these outfits by surprise. Their theory postulated a class difference between the “workers’ states” and capitalism; yet Stalinist rulers moved from one to the other peacefully!
The advocates of bureaucratic collectivism faced the same contradiction. The Cliffite state capitalists, spared that problem, nevertheless predicted nothing, having claimed that the U.S.-USSR cold war could only intensify. This notion stemmed from the outlook they shared with the other theories, namely that Stalinism, whether progressive or reactionary, would supersede traditional capitalism. Reality buried that nonsense also.
These analyses in all their variety were rationalizations for pragmatism, not guides to action. The false theories, reflecting the left’s underlying middle-class outlook, saw the Stalinist states either as progressive societies embodying workers’ power in a distorted way, or as systems where counterrevolution had wiped out the proletarian revolutionary gains or even the proletariat itself. Either way, the system was powerful and the working class deemed weak.
In contrast, our world view led us to see that Stalinism was in a state of permanent crisis, an exacerbated reflection of the overall world capitalist crisis. The working class was objectively very powerful but subjectively weak because of the absence of the revolutionary workers’ party and its struggle to advance class consciousness. 
The decisive event that severed the last connections between the Bolshevik party of communist workers who led the revolution, and the state which was increasingly the property of the Stalinist bureaucracy, was the Great Purge at the end of the 1930’s. This consolidated the Stalinists as a ruling capitalist class. And unlike the “orthodox Trotskyists” who denied this counterrevolution, we maintained that the socialist revolution could only be made by the working class with its revolutionary party in the lead. They, on the contrary, did not let the crushing of the working class by the Stalinists in East Europe, China and elsewhere prevent them from seeing a progressive role for Stalinism and declaring the creation of “deformed workers’ states” in these countries.
We have constantly fought for Karl Marx’s central theme that the proletariat could achieve revolutionary consciousness only through its own class actions. Our defining concept has therefore been the struggle for the revolutionary party as the instrument of the advanced workers themselves.
Re-Create the Fourth International!
While we have been restricted to a membership in the United States for most our organization’s life, we have always understood our politics to be that of an international tendency, the basis for a world party of the working class. The interests of the working class are international and can only be solved through the world socialist revolution. A party of the most class-conscious workers, bringing together their experience of class struggle in all corners of the globe, is necessary for the victory of the socialist revolution.
We seek to re-create the Fourth International, the world revolutionary party led by Leon Trotsky after the destruction of the Third International, and the inheritor of the revolutionary politics of the first three Internationals.
In 1987, after extensive political discussions which confirmed general political agreement, we formed a fraternal relationship with the Workers Revolution Group (WRG) in Australia. (See PR 28.) The world party we fight to build will be based on democratic centralism, whereby an international leadership will direct the general political struggles of its national sections. But our limited resources prevented such a centralism. Our fraternal relationship recognized this, expressing the fact that our two groups had broad strategic agreement but could not be responsible for each others’ important tactical decisions.
Five years later the LRP and WRG established fraternal relations with the League for the Revolutionary Party (FRP) of Sweden. At the same time, the three fraternal groups adopted the name Communist Organization for the Fourth International (COFI). (PR 41).
The 1992 general strike in Melbourne, Australia saw the WRG participate in a decisive class battle and win important experience for our international tendency. In the wake of the defeat of that struggle however, the cynicism that spread within the left infiltrated the ranks of the WRG and decimated the group. Then in 1995, political differences between us and the FRP of Sweden made it necessary to dissolve fraternal relations. (PR 46  and 48.) Today we maintain the banner of COFI as we move toward international ties which will be crucial in re-creating the Fourth International itself.
The Coming Revolutionary Struggles
Our analysis of Stalinism is far from simply a historical question: it is key to our perspective on the mass revolutionary struggles looming on the horizon. We were able to foresee the collapse of Stalinism because we understood how the statified property relations of the East made those economies most vulnerable to the developing economic crisis of world capitalism. Thus we predicted that the collapse of Stalinism in the East would presage a similar crisis in the West, and so the deepening industrial stagnation and financial instability testifies.
Most pseudo-Marxist groups acknowledge that capitalism is headed for a crisis, but their theories point to the opposite conclusion. Those who saw Stalinism as progressive should expect a world capitalist resurgence on the basis of its collapse. Those who saw its societies as capitalist but nonetheless the trend of future capitalist development only show their confusion and pragmatism today.
The working-class eruptions in East Europe during the 1980’s showed Gorbachev & Co. the handwriting on the wall and brought the system down. Today, capitalism’s bestial agencies, national chauvinism and racism, are doing the dirty work of promoting fratricidal war among toilers around the world. Capitalism is forced to use these weapons because its system is collapsing. 
In the post-Stalinist states, bourgeoisification is not proceeding easily; workers do not look favorably on the rampant inflation and mass unemployment that the “Western model” has brought them. In the West, the huge French strikes in late 1995 were echoed in late 1996 and are only a token of what is coming. In the South, the socialist-minded working class of South Africa grows more and more explosively angry over the lack of change brought about by the same old ruling class, now dappled with black faces. 
The reformist misleaders of the working class avoid struggle by capitulating to capitalist attacks. They allow huge reductions in wages and massive growth in unemployment. They embrace division of the working class by openly accepting national chauvinism and covertly adapting to racism. 
Nevertheless, mass upheaval and class confrontation are absolutely inevitable; a successful revolutionary conclusion is not. The fight to expose the reformist bureaucrats who dominate the unions around the world as well as their social democratic parties must be intensified. The class struggle received a magnificent shot in the arm when the grip of the Stalinists in the West as well as in the East was shattered; now the rest of the bureaucracy must be smashed if revolution is to succeed. A vital element in the political work necessary in order to re-create the authentic Fourth International is the fight against cynicism, especially cynicism about the revolutionary capacity of the world proletariat. Today, that is the major ideological armament of decadent capitalism and a chief weapon in the hands of its defenders within the workers’ movement, the bureaucrats.
The centrists, relatively small and dispirited today, still serve as a vital weapon for the bureaucracy. Their cynical theories still enable them to poison the growth of consciousness and to play a role in detouring advanced workers away from the crucial task of re-creating their revolutionary party. Combat with these forces is an important element in the struggle to build the vanguard party in the U.S. and abroad. 
In contrast to the maneuverism of the cynical condescending saviors of Middle-Class Marxism, we reaffirm our belief in the lesson taught us by our major teachers—Marx, Engels, Lenin, Luxemburg, Trotsky: a fighting working class needs to know the truth above all else. After twenty years, the LRP remains dedicated to the idea that a proletariat in action, aware of its real mass power, led by its most conscious vanguard, can destroy the rule of murderous capitalism and create a truly human society.
The Bolsheviks taught us that bad times steel the cadres of a revolutionary party fully as much as good times and successful class struggles. It is no accident that the LRP has not only endured the dog years but has gone far toward arming itself politically for the coming struggles.

There is no greater proof of capitalism’s inability to control noxious air pollution than the current presidential campaign. No wonder the most popular candidate has been “none of the above.”
As we write during the primaries, George Bush’s popularity has fallen by half in the year since the Gulf War. But recently his chances improved – not because the voters like him any better, but they’ve now got a whiff of his rivals.
The story so far: Bush’s main Republican challenger attacked the “Washington establishment” and did well at first only to collapse afterwards. As for the Democrats, as soon as they got a front-runner, the polls showed that even his supporters thought him the least lousy of a rotten lot. With the speedy withdrawal of Wall Street’s entry and “labor’s candidate,” a new inside “outsider” puffed himself up, but then that gasbag also burst. All along, uncommitted slates collected big fractions of the vote, often beating major candidates. Even bigger numbers stayed home on primary day.
And then a new independent candidate pops up whose major advantage is that nobody knows him. But he has the billions to convert that asset into vague popularity.
The great majority of Americans have not given up on elections as the way to achieve their needs and hopes. Not yet. But they are bitter over governmental policy. They want decisive changes, and they’re not getting them. Neither the candidates nor their parties seem to reflect the “ordinary citizen’s” deepening concerns and fears. The underlying reason is that what they really want they will never get from bourgeois elections.
Certainly it’s not that the office being sought is powerless. The soon-to-be-elected president will have to deal with momentous events at home and abroad. He will preside over the only remaining military superpower. His decisions spell life or death for millions: the so-called third world slides deeper into starvation and slavery; the former Stalinist empire has collapsed into a market “solution” that is no longer marketable; the world economy stands at the brink of a major depression. Most important to the voters is the floundering economy, the growing unemployment and decaying living standards at home. Surely the White House should be able to do something decisive!
Yet aside from phony-sounding populism, what has the primary campaign been about? Adultery, draft-dodging, pot-smoking, corruption – penny-ante issues all. Voters are looking for big answers that aren’t being offered. No wonder the electorate is holding its nose. Like Bill Clinton, real people are afraid to inhale. 
The Role Of The Presidency
The morality issues that have dominated the campaign are trivial. But they do serve a purpose: they afford the candidates practice in lying, cover-up, backstabbing and ass-kissing – habits in which the winner will have to be an accomplished expert in order to responsibly conduct the affairs of state once in office.
All U.S. presidents oversee the super-exploitation of the globe. All must say they wish the end of layoffs and poverty at home, while of necessity they have to maintain these conditions. All since Hoover have waged war somewhere on the planet – and so have ordered working-class men to massacre others, as well as women and children, who have done nothing to deserve it. And they have all blatantly lied about their deeds. Such is bourgeois morality.
The voters are right to be concerned about the candidates’ obvious lack of integrity. Their mistake is to consider such corruption and hypocrisy to be an individual matter, not an absolute necessity of capitalist politics. Consequently many expect virtues that are desirable from a human standpoint but are in fact disqualifications for the presidency.
While voters are currently disaffected, they do not yet see that the real purpose of presidential elections is to choose which leader and policy is best for capitalism at this conjuncture, not for “the people.” Elections are the arena in which the ruling class periodically determines its strategy towards the rest of us. Abroad, will the war against Washington’s imperialist rivals be cold, cool or hot? Will U.S. imperialism dominate the post-Cold War world? At home, should the attack on workers and oppressed people be accelerated or moderated? 
The Political Charade
For a real understanding of the electoral process and this year’s issues, we turn to Ernest Hollings, an outspoken Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee. He wrote:
It has been a classic election-year set piece: the Democrats stick it to the rich and the Republicans bully-rag the Democrats for raising taxes. ...
This charade nicely serves the election-year purposes of Democrats and Republicans. But it grossly disserves a nation starving for economic leadership. The gamesmanship is all the more disgraceful when you consider that both parties essentially agree on the shape of an economic package.
Then he tells us what both parties in fact stand for: Capital gains, everybody gains. It is silly to tout a capital gains tax cut as the holy grail and equally silly to demonize it. Most of us appreciate that if a cut is structured to reward long-term investments, it can make a difference. Democrats on both Congressional tax-writing committees have voted unanimously for cuts in capital gains taxes. Indeed, the Ways and Means Committee’s plan would be even more generous than the President’s.
Too bad if you thought that Republicans (plus Paul Tsongas) were for lowering taxes for the rich while the Democrats opposed such rip-offs. As Clinton, the Arkansas populist, stated in a Time interview, he and Tsongas, the Wall Street lobbyist, “agree on our general [economic] approach.” He called it an “investment as opposed to consumption-based strategy” – as if the problem with the U.S. economy is excessive consumption by working people.
But let us continue with Senator Hollings, just in case you thought the Democrats at least favored a bit more government support for the needy:
A Democrat could have delivered President Bush’s State of the Union message: he’s for a boost in Head Start, in the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program, Pell grants for college students, highway spending and more.
Or at least that the Democrats aren’t as uptight about government spending. But as Hollings says:
Goose the economy, not the deficit. All must agree on this: with a whopping 20 percent of outlays going to pay interest on the $3.8 trillion national debt, the anti-recession package must not add a dime to the deficit.
That is, pay off the banks and financiers, and screw the working people. Then the good Senator sums up:
Given the remarkable extent of Democratic-Republican agreement, why are we being so disagreeable? Let the Democrats pass their plan, and let the President have his veto. Then let’s move a truly bipartisan plan through Congress this month.
Hollings is complaining not about the political charade he so accurately describes. On the contrary, he accepts the electoral need to lie to the public: he is a Democrat. The problem is that the charade is going on too long and is interfering with the necessary program they all agree on. 
Third-Party Fakers
The stench from the Democrats is so strong this year that some on the left have been drawn to third party orientations. Leftists have been cheerleaders for the National Organization for Women, which promised to build a party independent of the Democrats and Republicans; and for the labor officials who have organized Labor Party Advocates (LPA). But both of these efforts are non-combatants in the present campaign. Their leaders are searching for “pro-choice” or “pro-labor” Democrats to chase after.
NOW held a large rally in Washington on April 5 awash with Democratic pols. It didn’t even bother with third-party soft soap for the masses there, although it did “inaugurate” its new party that weekend. LPA raised not a murmur against the AFL-CIO’s initial endorsement of Senator Tom Harkin, who is so tied to the health insurance vampires that he couldn’t offer a national health plan, the demand most on working people’s minds. LPA’s silence was even more deafening over labor’s second choice, Clinton – the notoriously anti-labor Governor who during the campaign apologized for General Motors’ planned layoff of 70,000 workers and applauded workers’ competing with each other over who can give bigger concessions to the bosses.
It is not just “progressives” who go along with NOW and LPA. A good many who consider themselves Leninists and Trotskyists, no less, are enthusiasts. (Some have even enlisted in the radical bourgeois campaign of Ron Daniels, director of the Rainbow Coalition controlled by Jesse Jackson during his Democratic presidential runs in the 1980’s.) Whatever criticisms they make, they never inform their fellow workers that they, as opposed to these flytraps, advocate overthrowing capitalism, not reforming it. Nor do they mention the elementary Bolshevik position that bourgeois elections cannot fundamentally change the system.
That most workers today have self-defeating illusions in the electoral process is tragic. For people who claim to be communists to foster such illusions in the electoral process, not to mention parties committed to preserving the capitalist system, is criminal.
Divide And Conquer
A significant aspect of the primaries has been the constant appeal by all candidates to the “middle class.” This is a standard way to refer to the working class without naming it. Its prominence in this campaign reflects the politicians’ intent to deepen the hostility of the better-off, more skilled, largely white workers against the worse-off layers of the working class – particularly Blacks, women and other oppressed groups. Using the term “working class” would suggest the common interest between these layers, all of whom are losing under the bosses’ attacks.
In the post-World War II decades, much of the working class (largely excluding working women and minorities) won a few crumbs out of U.S. imperialism’s super-profits gained from world domination. In the 1960’s, the Black urban rebellions gained promises of civil rights and social programs. But in the late ’70’s and the ’80’s, the bourgeoisie started to take back many of these gains to prop up its falling profit rates. And with their profits, they declined to invest in domestic productive manufacturing, instead engaging in an orgy of financial speculation and militarist empire-building.
In the ’90’s the U.S. bourgeoisie has begun to realize that its long swill at the profits trough, plus its dedication to military as opposed to industrial production, have cost it the economic leadership of the world. For months, the leading Democratic candidates, Clinton and Tsongas, boasted of their farsighted economic programs, proclaiming their intent to “make America competitive” again. This not only meant chauvinist Japan-bashing in the campaign, but a continued domestic austerity policy, a crackdown on the wages and conditions of all workers.
What the capitalists have won back through layoffs, speed-up and other concessions has so far proved insufficient to restore profit rates. A far deeper attack is necessary. Divide and conquer is the weapon the bosses and their politicians use.
That is why both Bush and Clinton inveigh against “welfare” and advocate “workfare” programs. These schemes divide employed from unemployed workers and union from non-union. They deepen the oppression of the poorest layers by forcing them to work at slave wages, while also undermining the wages of the unionized workers.
It is a myth that people do not want increased government services. Suffering already, they do not want the additional burden of paying for them. This justified feeling has been twisted, for the moment, into an attack on socialism and social spending. And as the anger against the rich grows, bourgeois demagogues ride the sentiment in order to turn it more sharply against the masses’ own interests.
Hence the flag-waving against Japan and other economic competitors that permeates the campaign. This drill is another effort to turn workers against each other along national and racial lines. The most strident perpetrators on this score were Harkin and Jerry Brown, the allegedly “pro-worker” contenders. 
Labor Movement Contained
Both the Democrats and Republicans are ruling-class parties whose voting bases include many workers and petty-bourgeois people. Both have the task of incorporating these bases: using them to slit their own throats. The Democrats play the key role here because they attract, especially in the depths of crises, the decisive urban industrial proletariat which has the power to shut down the entire economy and its production of profits.
For all their peace pretensions, the Democrats are the party that led the U.S. into its big wars. Playing the card of nationalism, the Democrats beat the tubs for active “internationalism” – trade and political confrontation. They lean on the sections of the capitalist class most interested in economic warfare. They attract the allegiance of workers who mistakenly see protectionism as helpful. It is no accident that so many Democrats are among the leading Japan-bashers. Their demagogy, designed to turn workers’ protests toward jingoism, is laying the ideological soil for the next world war.
The movements which the Democratic Party has done the most to destroy are the labor and Black movements. In the 1930’s, “progressives,” including the right-wing social democrats but especially the Communist party, had enough strength within the labor aristocracy to bloc with the liberals in the American version of the Popular Front. They succeeded in acting as Roosevelt’s social policemen, keeping the working class from going beyond the Democrats.
After the war the rebellion reignited. There was again sentiment for a Labor Party, and again it was derailed by the progressives. The CP and its allies detoured the movement into a third capitalist party behind Henry Wallace. And with the outbreak of the Cold War, the social democrats helped steer the workers back to the Democrats.
In the Cold War prosperity-bubble years, the unions became even more bureaucratized. Labor officials still had to lead mass strikes, and given the temporary prosperity, they won wage gains and fringe benefit promises. The bureaucracy succeeded in diverting the remaining working-class motion from the political front.
With the resurgence of the economic crisis in the early 1970’s, workers once again began to move. The bureaucracy had strengthened itself through its interpenetration with government and was able to channel the strike outbreak. Some strikes, denied official recognition, became wildcats and faced isolation and government repression. Others were made official but still kept isolated by union tactics.
Above all, the union bureaucrats championed electoralism as preferable to strikes. It was perfectly true that the working class needed a political alternative, since the state had intervened heavily into the economy and the unions. As well, hours and wages could not be seriously improved in one plant or industry – it has to be across the board. But the unions were tied to the Democrats, who had nothing to offer.
Today the labor bureaucrats are caught in their own trap. Not one of the candidates is a recognizable “friend of labor.” Harkin was a fake, Clinton an enemy, Brown simply a maneuver to get a brokered convention to stop Clinton. But then they’d be left with the likes of Mario Cuomo, a pseudo-liberal whose actual record in New York State paralleled Reagan’s in Washington. 
Black Rebellion Quelled
The Black movement’s drive for civil rights was stalled by the early 1970’s. The government was giving Martin Luther King’s followers less and less. Black power forces were on the rise, but the real social movement was taking place in the urban ghettoes. Only Malcolm X had reflected the heartbeat of this movement, which threatened to transcend all the middle-class leaderships – the integrationists certainly, but even the nationalists. Malcolm’s search for an anti-imperialist solution was terminated by his assassins.
The ghetto rebellions of the 1960’s produced gains: jobs for at least a layer of Blacks, access to college education, the possibility of higher incomes. To quell the eruptions, the ruling class sought to stimulate the growth of a middle-class professional leadership tied to welfare programs and reform institutions, which the government expanded in the Black communities under pressure from the riots. These institutions, not surprisingly, were thoroughly linked to the traditional party of urban America, the Democrats.
Against this scenario, the most advanced Black activists realized that liberation required massive political action to challenge the government. Radical options from the bureaucrat-dominated unions seemed unlikely. Hence the efforts toward Black working-class action, like the Revolutionary Union Movements in Detroit and some sections of the Black Panther party. Hence also the variety of conferences aimed at producing a national Black party. But the masses of Black workers were more aware of the nature of the system than many radical leaders. If you’re demanding reforms within the system rather than revolution (except in rhetoric), it makes sense to orient toward a party that wields power. Thus the radical third-partyists soon retreated back into the Democratic Party, together with the traditional integrationists.
Still under pressure, the ruling class turned more toward Black politicians. Black leaders wanted more say within the power structure, to carve out a larger share of the pie distributed through state agencies. In reality these officials, reflecting the reality of decaying capitalism, were needed to remove past gains, once the movements had subsided and the masses were retied to electoralism.
That scenario would be very familiar to New Yorkers who elected the Black “friend of labor” and “socialist” David Dinkins mayor in 1989, only to find that his tax and budget policies coincided perfectly with Wall Street’s demands. 
The Jackson Jive
Jesse Jackson rode to leadership among Blacks by championing the “movement” under worsening economic conditions. With great dynamism, he campaigned both in 1984 and 1988 to register more Blacks and keep them snared in the Democratic Party. He also appealed to white workers with a populist message. Despite the illusions of leftists who lined up behind him to “build the movement” or at least a third party, Jackson had no such intention and made his plans perfectly clear. (See Proletarian Revolution No. 21.) Jackson succeeded in burying the incipient movement. The Democratic Party, as always, proved a deathtrap.
As a consequence, neither the labor nor Black struggle exists as a genuine movement today. There is anger among both workers and Blacks, especially among Black workers. But the masses have not yet found a direction.
In a sense, the Democratic Party has succeeded in its mission too well. By destroying the social movements that it misled, it also destroyed the reason for its own influence. If you’re going to get austerity no matter whom you elect, why choose Democrats? (As the April elections in Britain showed, if you’re going to get a Tory program no matter whom you vote for, choose the real Tories, not half-assed substitutes.) And why bother voting?
George Bush’s openly racist campaign in 1988 scared the Democratic politicians: their party was becoming too closely identified with Blacks. This year Jackson gave another demonstration of party loyalty: he stayed out of the race. Due to his success in burying the movement, the real questions of racism have been too easily ignored in the primaries.
Under these circumstances, the media have hailed Clinton’s supposed new coalition of Blacks and whites as an interracial miracle. The New York Times said after his victory in the Florida primary with 75 percent of the Black vote:
That one figure gives healthy evidence, probably for the first time since Robert Kennedy’s Indiana primary campaign in 1968, that it is politically possible to bring poor blacks and blue-collar white voters together. It is finally possible for Americans to transcend racial division and look instead to mutual interests. (March 11.)
What drivel! When the bourgeois press hails working-class interests, watch your wallet. Here we have a victorious “alliance” between Blacks and whites (both groups made up largely of workers, contrary to the Times) based on no struggle and no common program. They just voted for the same candidate – and very few of them at that. While some
Blacks did support Clinton in Michigan and Illinois, most stayed away in droves, recognizing the reality of the new integrated bloc they’re officially part of. Clinton’s coalition comes as the reward of ignoring Blacks and the need to help defend them from mounting discrimination and racist attacks.
Clinton’s hypocrisy in attacking “welfare” while prating about racial harmony marks the exact conjuncture of present-day capitalism. Anti-black sentiment is being marshalled, but it is not yet time for a nakedly racist attack.
Republicans And Fascists
The Republican Party’s main base, aside from the handful of top capitalists, has been the upwardly mobile petty bourgeoisie. It has also attracted an element of the working class which accepts that the bosses should be in charge. But in times of accelerating crisis it also ensnares workers looking for an alternative to the Democrats’ betrayal.
A significant portion of Reagan’s vote came from disaffected white workers who normally vote Democratic. For them this was not a conservative turn but a radical leap. Based on racist ideas and the prominence of Blacks in the Democratic party, their vote was nevertheless an attempt to break from traditional politics. A revolutionary working-class alternative, clearly showing that capitalism is the enemy, is the way to win such people from reaction.
The failure of mass left parties to challenge capitalism has allowed the radicalization produced by the crisis to take right-wing forms in many countries. Ultra-reactionary and even neo-fascist organizations are growing ominously in Western and Eastern Europe. In the U.S., this trend gave the majority of white votes to David Duke in Louisiana. His program, populistic and ultra-right, still carried an openly pro-capitalist message, not the demagogic anti-capitalism characteristic of Nazism and fascism.
Duke, indisputably a Nazi and Klan leader, chose to present himself as a mere ultra-conservative to try for the governorship of Louisiana. He ran in favor of “free enterprise”; his menacing line demanding white “equality” was not accompanied by lynch mobs or a mass mobilization. The right-wing “populists” have not yet built a social movement, but Duke obviously intends to do so when times are riper.
The Duke campaign sharpened the electoralism question. Most of the left has no presence in Louisiana and got away without a clear policy, but some “progressive” journals did hint that it would be good to vote for Duke’s Democratic rival. That was Edwin Edwards, a particularly sleazy bourgeois politician who offered nothing to the low-income whites who fell for Duke. Edwards was the big business candidate; he won because the bosses, not yet ready for a Duke, threatened higher unemployment for Louisiana if Duke got in.
Trying to “stop Duke” with Democrats is futile. Just as Carter’s attacks on working people set the stage for Reagan, continued austerity under the Democrats will only ripen the conditions that breed fascism.
Duke’s success propelled Pat Buchanan to run in the early Republican primaries to win back the right-wing leadership. Buchanan did capture the growing anger of the Republicans’ petty-bourgeois base against the upper-class center of the party symbolized by Bush. Interestingly, Buchanan, a man with long establishment conservative credentials, adopted a populist facade to reach the masses. He even endorsed Social Security, previously denounced as “socialistic.” And his America Firstism and Japan-bashing were a switch from free-market politics. Still, as soon as he had driven Bush to the right and pulled the rug from under Duke, he went into slow motion. His role now is to strengthen the party so that it continues to incorporate movements that imperil capitalist institutional life.
There will come a time when capitalism is so threatened by the proletarian movement that its party apparatuses will permit alliances with untamed reactionary forces. To preserve itself, capitalism is quite capable of shedding the skin of democracy and resting on a pseudo-radical fascist movement. It has happened elsewhere; it can happen here. Since the bourgeoisie knows that electoralism in reality is a sham, it is high time the working class understood this truth too.
What Is To Be Done?
With the economy hovering near a full-scale depression and the labor and Black struggles bottled up by hopeless leaderships, there is no short-cut to salvation. Capitalism itself is the real organizer of the working class. Upheaval is inevitable. The task of authentic communists is not to build new capitalist parties or pro-capitalist labor parties, but to fight those who will mislead and entrap the coming movements. To do so we have to build the nucleus of a revolutionary workers’ party.
When capitalists, liberals and bureaucrats are doing their utmost to divide the working class, when phony electoral combinations are the only form of “unity” offered, the only alternative is to unite workers in mass action against the system. Such action means a general strike.
We have argued that workers need a political alternative. But that does not mean accepting the bosses’ electoral deception. It means working-class activity. A general strike can succeed where local, divided strikes are too weak to win. It can prevent concessions and layoffs, win decent health care and keep wages ahead of inflation. However, we tell our fellow workers that such a strike will mean confrontation with the capitalists, their politicians and their state apparatus. A general strike informs the working class of its true force; it also poses the question of which class holds state power.
A confrontation between classes is inevitable. The ruling class will have its armed thugs and fascist bands when it needs them. The future fascist movement will also use the electoral platform to proselytize for its real strategy of genocidal action, not lever pulling. Undoubtedly the future communist movement will also use elections as Lenin urged – to raise working-class consciousness and teach the danger of the electoral trap. If we are to thwart fascism and win masses to the goal of a truly human society, the working class must have its forces and leadership ready as well.

The Struggle for the Revolutionary Party

Socialist Voice No. 1 (Fall 1976)
 Transcribed, Edited and Formatted by Damon Maxwell and David Walters in 2008 for the Encyclopedia of Trotskyism On-Line.

 The following article was first published in Socialist Voice No. 1 (Fall 1976). It represents the first detailed analysis by the League for the Revolutionary Party of its expulsion from the Revolutionary Socialist League and the degeneration of that (now-defunct) organization in the context of a broader right turn by the middle-class centrist left.
The League for the Revolutionary Party (LRP) has been formed to carry out the struggle for revolutionary leadership of the working class that was undertaken in the past by the Revolutionary Socialist League (RSL). The RSL’s left wing, the Revolutionary Party Tendency, was expelled on February 15th of this year, and its members joined with previously-expelled comrades including Central Committee members Sy Landy and Walter Dahl to organize the LRP. The LRP stands for the program of Lenin and Trotsky, the revolutionary communism of our epoch, that is rapidly being abandoned by the RSL. 
The expulsions were criminal acts against the interests of the working class. 
In 1976 world capitalism is skirting the edge of a profound crisis. The bourgeoisie is seeking to claw its way out of the impending disaster by chipping away all the hard-won gains of the proletariat. In the face of this assault the workers are tragically misled and therefore disunited. The bulk of our class feels itself to be powerless, lacking any credible alternative to the trade union bureaucrats and liberal politicians who betray them at every turn. Many of these workers resign themselves to hanging on, hoping that the present shallow economic upswing will bring relief. Others, a distinct but crucial minority consisting of the most politically advanced workers, are still searching for an alternative. They are fighting, attempting to forge a new leadership built upon a program that will put an end to the prevailing desperation. 
The real solution to the looming disaster, the only real deterrent to the attack on the working masses by capitalism, is the socialist revolution. The defense of even the present working class living standards must come from the revolutionary struggle, because capitalism will yield its minimal sops and reforms only out of fear of mass upsurges that cannot be controlled. But where are the revolutionaries to lead such a struggle? In the United States, what passes for a left alternative to the reigning bureaucrats—the various Maoist and allegedly Trotskyist groups—offers only one-step-better leaflets and no clear-sighted direction. The RSL, which once sought to be a real alternative, has now chosen to be “realistic” like the centrists, those who in their vacillations preach socialism but practice reformism. In order to move right it was forced to expel its steadfast revolutionary wing. The lessons drawn from this struggle, although based on the history of one organization, are of vital importance for revolutionaries everywhere. 
The split was produced by a profoundly pessimistic attitude toward the working class and its capacity to make the socialist revolution. The majority, in its constantly changing justifications for expelling the left wing never even claimed that the issues at stake were enough to warrant dividing the revolutionary cadre. By themselves the issues were not decisive; in a healthy organization they would have been tested in practice, and the minority repeatedly stated its loyal willingness to do this. But the loyalty was contemptuously sneered at. The expulsion itself and the supremely cynical way it was carried out by the RSL leadership proves that the split was the result of a deep political differentiation. 
Trotsky, shortly before his murder at Stalin’s hands, had waged a critical faction fight in the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), the American section of the Fourth International, against the Shachtmanite minority who traitorously split the party on the eve of World War II. In answer to the question of whether the political differences, warranted a split, Trotsky stated:
 
“If we take the Political differences as they are, we can say they were not sufficient for a split, but if they developed a tendency to turn away from the proletariat in the direction of petty-bourgeois circles then the same differences can have an absolutely different value; a different weight; if they are connected with a different social group. This is a very important point. 
“We have the fact that the minority split away from us, in spite of all the measures taken by the majority not to split. This signifies that their inner social feeling was such that it is impossible for them to go together with us. It is a petty-bourgeois tendency, not a proletarian.” (In Defense of Marxism, page 181)
With the roles of majority and minority reversed, the RSL leaders revealed their inner class nature by the very act of splitting and the methods used for the task. Their utter cynicism and the politics that flow from it testify to the petty-bourgeois nature of the RSL bureaucracy. 
Politics of the Faction Fight
The fight began in September 1975 when a minority of RSL members raised objections to a proposed resolution before the Central Committee. The resolution introduced fatalistic and defeatist ideas into the generally agreed upon perspective for heightened class struggle:
 
“There will be a rise in the class struggle, greatest in the countries most affected by the crisis. At the same time, the struggles will not be united although the struggle in the semi- and under- developed countries will be ‘joined’ by workers in the more healthy, advanced countries this will not be impressed on the consciousness of the overwhelming majority of the workers. The struggle will retain its fragmented unconscious level. 
“Thus while we do not expect a massive outbreak of the class struggle in the U.S. or on a world scale, we do not expect the relative peace of the past period to continue to the same degree. Rather we see a rising curve of class struggle largely limited to trade union and democratic struggles.” (Emphasis added.)
Thus the RSL majority put forward an openly stagist view and accepted the limitation of the class struggle to bourgeois consciousness for the next period. Accordingly, the majority made its central political slogan the demand for a labor party in the U.S. In the late 1930’s the Trotskyists of the SWP had advocated a labor party in order to translate the massive struggles that created the CIO into political action against the bourgeoisie. They put forward a revolutionary program for such a party in order to lead the workers’ upsurge towards the building of the revolutionary vanguard. Whereas Trotsky hoped that the labor party slogan would intensify the struggle between the classes, the RSL’s purpose is to accept a reduced level of struggle. Whereas Trotsky argued that it would be absurd and reactionary to advocate a reformist labor party, the RSL’s labor party is designed for a democratic and trade unionist stage which condemns it to a reformist program. 
“There is no mass revolutionary party intervening in this year’s elections. Should we let the labor hacks go hat in hand to the Democrats until a revolutionary party is formed? No. A revolutionary party cannot be built separate from the struggles of the working class...” 
“Revolutionaries will fight for the labor party to adopt a revolutionary program. But we will support a labor party which makes a break on clear class lines to put forward the defense of the workers as a class against the capitalists and their parties.” (Torch, April 15, 1976)
It is true that there is no revolutionary party, and it is equally true that there is no labor party. The RSL position is not only that a labor party struggle must precede a revolutionary party, but that it will be a reformist struggle. The promise to fight for a revolutionary program once the reformist labor party is built at the first stage is simply a revolutionary cover for a stagist conception. The labor party that the RSL advocates (not just “will support”) is a reformist party; this Trotsky was never willing to concede. 
Without Trotsky’s revolutionary content, the labor party slogan leads the workers into the electoralist illusions deliberately fostered by the labor bureaucrats. It is not only the Democratic Party that the bureaucrats press for; in the wake of Vietnam, Watergate and the economic crisis, they seek at all costs to reestablish faith in the system, the government and its “orderly processes,” elections. It is no accident that the RSL uses the slogan in a purely electoralist fashion. In different ways but for related reasons, the union bureaucrats and the RSL use their electoralist slogans to forestall confrontation between the workers and the state. 
Just when it is of the utmost necessity to fight the reformist bureaucrats’ attempts to shackle the working class within a democratic and trade unionist program, the RSL proclaims its agreement that such is the limit of this “stage.” If workers’ consciousness does go only this far it will be the responsibility of capitulatory leadership which determines that nothing more is possible. The RSL has joined the chorus instead of appealing to advanced workers to fight this self-fulfilling prophecy. Marxists must reject this surface “reality” if they are to survive as revolutionaries. 
During the dispute the RSL leaders moved even further right. They renounced the slogan of the general strike fought for by the minority in favor of the labor party. Whereas the labor bureaucrats refused to call the working class into action to fight the bourgeois attacks, rightly fearing the latent power of the class, the RSL based its refusal on the alleged weakness of the workers:
 
“Therefore, we use the defensive general strike as a goal to be built towards, as something which requires preparation and an understanding of the forces confronting the proletariat. It is not something which we in general want to call for launching under immediate circumstances and certainly not on a national scale.” (Torch editor Jack Gregory, “The Marxist Approach to the Labor Party and the General Strike,” RSL internal bulletin)
Thus the RSL opposed the general strike, accepting the backward workers’ mistaken understanding of objective reality as instilled by the labor bureaucrats. The Bolshevik understanding is that the world situation is objectively mature for revolution, and it is the workers’ backward consciousness—their conservatism, fear, and sense of impotence—that must be changed. The mass of workers have a mixed consciousness; anger and explosiveness run as a steady current just below the surface. Coupled with the objective situation that a unified working class in the United States would have enormous power, this means that an explosion is building up. To those who tail backward consciousness the workers’ response will come like a thunderclap out of the blue—as in France in 1968. 
The RSL’s fears of the workers’ weakness led to further capitulations. In the turbulent struggle of the New York City workers against the massive bourgeois attacks around the city’s financial crisis, the RSL sought to avoid confrontation. That it did call backhandedly for a general strike in its newspaper (despite its private opposition cited above) was further proof of its cynicism and its opportunism in tailing a militant sector of the proletariat. The leadership also began a policy of adapting to out-of-power bureaucrats in the trade unions in order to gain “legitimacy.” Frequently, it refrained from counterposing revolutionary leadership to the present bureaucracy and proposed an “independent rank and file” alternative. This has by now almost totally displaced the call for revolutionary leadership in the RSL’s trade union work reported in theTorch. Once again, the RSL is assuming a stage when revolutionary ideas cannot be placed before the masses. 
These two two-stagist conceptions were opposed in documents put forward by Comrade Landy and other oppositionists. The Landy documents maintained that the roots of opportunist politics in the RSL lay in its isolation from the class struggle and the limitations posed on that struggle by the labor bureaucrats. In a bourgeois society isolation does not mean removal from all social pressures; it subjected the RSL to class pressures from the petty bourgeoisie and made it susceptible to backward—i.e., pro-bourgeois—sentiments within large layers of the working class. 
 
The RSL’s Bureaucratism
The isolation from struggle permitted an internal bureaucracy to flourish in the RSL. Clique relations substituted for politics. For example, the controversial Central Committee resolution had never been discussed with Cde. Landy, a member of the organization’s leading Political Committee. In response, the Landy documents called for a fight against the growing bureaucratism, exemplified by the majority’s proposal to narrow the Political Committee to long-term personal associates of National Secretary Ron Taber (thus removing Cde. Landy) and by the fact that every single member of the Central Committee except for Cdes. Landy and Dahl was now on the full-time staff of the organization. The new right turn signaled the victory of the apparatus. 
For months the RSL leaders conducted an internal fight that was almost unique in its steadfast refusal to deal with the opposition’s views. After the majority’s new line was thoroughly analyzed and refuted in the document “The RSL in Crisis: 
 Behindthe Labor Party Slogan ” by Landy and Dahl, the right-wing leadership quickly issued an edict banning the opposition and its documents. It then retroactively prohibited the circulation of the Landy-Dahl document even though it had already been accepted for publication. No rebuttal was ever written, as the RSL leaders had turned to bureaucratic pragmatism as a method of struggle, instead of developing the political understanding of the working class or even the RSL membership. 
Throughout the fight the right wing relied almost exclusively on petty organizational maneuvers and bureaucratic harassment against the minority, relieved only by liberal doses of slander and character assassination. A few examples will suffice:
 

â¢ Both minority Central Committee members were expelled in quick succession on trumped-up charges, one by telephone without even the semblance of a trial. 
â¢ 
â¢ After the expulsion of the left wing’s senior leaders it was then denied representation on any leadership body, local or national, even in proportion to its numbers. 
â¢ 
â¢ Members of the Bolshevik opposition were arbitrarily transferred to different branches for the express purpose of breaking up the opposition. 
â¢ 
â¢ The majority leadership attempted to force a member of the minority to sell the Torchpublicly at her workplace, thus fingering her to her bosses, when there was no conceivable justification for such a risk. 
â¢ 
â¢ When Cde. Landy was expelled, the Torchdeliberately avoided citing the wild personal charges that had been concocted against him and published instead another set of lies, never attempting to warn the workers against what the RSL considered his dangerous politicalerrors. The article was such an obvious camouflage that the Torch was forced to print Cde. Landy’s “Open Letter” exposing the fraud. In its reply, the Torchproduced yet a third set of outright lies including a completely fabricated quotation and a denial that the minority’s major documents even existed! 
â¢ 
â¢ The final trial of the remaining opposition members was modeled afterAlice in Wonderland. The minority was accused of being in political agreement with its own expelled leaders! It was also accused of circulating the Landy-Dahl document to other RSL members (a fiendish move, considering that the document had already been made publicly available by the expelled members). Materials needed for the defense, including minutes of the previous expulsions, were denied to the minority on the grounds that it was “disloyal”—before the “trial”. 
â¢ 
â¢ At the trial itself the minority comrades so annihilated the right-wing leadership politically that the leadership could only reply with a frenzied physical attack on the left. 
â¢ 
Why did the left opposition stand up under the constant harassment and remain with the rapidly degenerating RSL? The RSL bureaucrats certainly hoped to intimidate the younger minority comrades into quitting voluntarily by expelling the tendency’s leaders. Instead, the left opposition stayed and fought for its politics, a “maneuver” that RSL leaders could not understand because they had abandoned politics for maneuverism and could only interpret the minority’s stance in that light. That the left wing was committed in principle to fighting for the revolutionary gains embodied in the RSL against its betrayers, was incomprehensible to tricksters. 
The Roots of the RSL
The RSL owed its existence to the workers’ struggles of the late 1960’s and early 1970’s. The depth and the limitations of these struggles go a long way toward explaining the RSL’s dynamic rise and subsequent dismal decline. During the 1950’s and 1960’s many radical intellectuals and students had written off the working class as a serious factor in society, let alone as the revolutionary agency. In the New Left bourgeois-democratic movements, cynical tears shed over the seeming quiescence of the working class passed for blinding practical insight. Suddenly in the late 1960’s the ghetto uprisings shook the urban centers of the United States. In France, the most massive general strike in history nearly toppled the “impregnable” strongman regime of DeGaulle. The eruption, which seemed to the intelligentsia to come from nowhere, reverberated throughout the world. 
The chain reaction upsurges were an unmistakable demand, despite their mixed level of consciousness, for a sharp change in the status quo. They bore witness to the crumbling of the prosperity facade in the imperialist countries and the worsening of the already critical conditions in the former colonies. Although workers’ struggle had of course occurred throughout the post-World War II period, the late 1960’s outburst was a qualitative breakthrough. It signaled the end of the democratic movements of the 1960’s, or at least their end in the form they had taken. The same deep crisis of capitalism that propelled the workers into motion was also setting the limits beyond which the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia could not go on its simple democratic and reform program. 
The democratic movements were petty-bourgeois both in composition and in politics. In the U.S., the anti-war movement, the black movement in both its civil rights and nationalist phases, and the women’s movement were led by students and sections of the intelligentsia. Working class people were certainly involved, especially in the black and Latin movements, but nowhere did working class groups take the lead on the basis of the working class program. The upsurges of the late 1960’s brought working class demands to the fore. 
Typically the left wing of the New Left movements began to “add” such demands to the bourgeois-democratic programs. For example, “full employment” and similar slogans were adopted by the movements in order to “orient towards” the working class. Students used the slogan of “Open Admissions” to colleges and schools, which they tacked on to nationalist demands for community control. 
Some New Left groups or sections of them, evolved into “socialist” groups. Others trickled into the older socialist sects which had gone through the period as semi-New Left groups themselves. Nevertheless, the essentially democratic and reform programs were retained, and a major effort was made to attract workers to movements that were still fundamentally bourgeois-democratic. Revolutionary working class slogans, capped by the demand for a workers’ state—the dictatorship of the proletariat—were viewed as “added” demands to be raised in the future after the first-stage demands were achieved. The proletarian upsurge had forced the left to rearrange itself, to sort out its programs and demands and to undertake a process of rethinking and experimentation, as the New Left movement crumbled. 
The International Socialists (IS) in the U.S. was one of the most profoundly affected groups. It was the successor to the original Shachtman split from Trotskyism in 1939-1940. Although the founders of the IS had broken from Shachtman to the left, they never reexamined the past course of their tendency nor the basis of Shachtmanism and were therefore doomed to repeat the errors of the past, albeit in new forms. They merely called a halt when Shachtman carried the logic of his method into the Democratic Party but they still accepted the strategy which had led to that capitulation:
 since it seemed obvious that the workers were not ready for revolution (Step 2) and were only beginning to fight for trade union and democratic demands (Step 1), the thing to do was to lie in wait for the workers with a program of democratic demands. There would be time later for Step 2. 
This was the same approach that led Shachtman to pose democracy and national liberation as the key to the struggle in Europe during World War II, with the socialist program put off for the future. Similarly, the growing movement in the U.S. auto industry at the end of World War II was restricted by the Shachtmanites and their allies into “rank and file” minimalism and thereby paved the way for Walter Reuther’s victory, since it raised nothing beyond which a left bureaucrat could not go. The same sort of reasoning led Shachtman into the Socialist Party of Norman Thomas (and worse), on the grounds that American workers were to the right of the SP and would have to go through it (Step 1) before they could grasp his “revolutionary” ideas (Step 2). Therefore Shachtman advocated a “broad” Socialist Party with the most minimal right-wing program as the necessary first step. Finally, the method led the Shachtmanites into the Democratic Party (and its Scoop Jackson-Jay Lovestone right wing, the next-to-last resting place for State Department Socialists.) Only Shachtman’s death cut his retreat short. 
This method inevitably leads to class collaboration, despite the sincere attempts of the ISers to hang back from Shachtman’s conclusions. The IS’s support in Portugal today for the Presidential candidacy of General Otelo de Carvalho, former head of the military government’s security force, is proof of the betrayal inherent in the two-stage method. 
The method is characteristic of most of the centrist ideologies that permeate the working class movement, not just the Shachtmanites. The Pabloites who destroyed the Fourth International as a revolutionary body in the 1950’s are less overt about it, given their need to pay lip service to Trotsky’s historic fight against stagism; nevertheless, they asserted the need for deep and lasting entry into the Communist Parties (and the Social-Democratic Parties where they were the key force) in order to reach the workers at Step 1. In the various Pabloite interpretations, either history, the pressure of the masses or Pabloites themselves would insure that the social revolution would follow after the workers had gone through Stalinism for an inevitable and lengthy period. 
The prime users of the stagist method, of course, are the Stalinists, whose Popular Fronts, “Historic Compromises,” People’s Democracies, New Democracies, etc., are all stages that tie workers to the bourgeoisie while putting off “socialism” for the future. And Stalinism furnishes the final proof of the consequences of stagism, since the only “socialism” that the People’s Democracies ever achieve is state capitalism. Step 2 turns out to be only a more resilient form of Step 1. 
Achievements of the RSL
The RSL was created in 1973 out of a split in the IS. The RSL represented the re-establishment of revolutionary Marxism in a living organization after the organizational continuity of the revolutionary tradition had been broken for two decades. It initially attracted wide interest outside of its own ranks and had the enthusiastic devotion of a young militant cadre. 
Against the stagism of the IS and other centrists, the RSL proclaimed the necessity of fighting openly as revolutionaries for the revolutionary program. “Say what is” to the working class was the slogan the RSL inherited from Trotsky. To tell the workers the truth, the RSL maintained, is to fight for revolutionary leadership, in particular to build the revolutionary party and the reconstructed Fourth International. The alternative of reforms, democracy and trade unionism by itself—that is, the bourgeois reformist program—solves nothing in the epoch of capitalist decay; indeed, it is the inevitable failure of reformism that paves the way for reactionary and fascist “solutions. Thus saying the truth is not an abstract moral question but a practical necessity. 
In working out its program the RSL made a number of fundamental contributions. It analyzed the post-war boom in the advanced countries as the result of the hegemony of American imperialism and the defeat of the working masses in Europe and Asia. The prosperity bubble in the imperialist homelands was the material basis for the reformism that sank the Marxist movement in the 1950’s and early 1960’s. The RSL was able to point out the superficial nature of the boom and to predict the resurgence of the underlying decay. The end of the boom was seen as the consequence of the underlying material causes embodied in the epoch of imperialist decline, not of capitalist monetary manipulations (as with the Healyite International Committee) or of inevitable but inexplicable “long cycles” (according to Ernest Mandel of the Pabloite United Secretariat). Thus the Trotskyist Transitional Program was grounded on firm material roots. 
In addition, the RSL expanded Trotsky’s theory of permanent revolution as it applied to the question of black liberation in the United States. American blacks were specially oppressed and forced to the bottom of the U.S. working class because of their denial of the fruits of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, the basic rights and liberties won by mass struggles including the Civil War. Because of capitalism’s inability to grant these rights in the epoch of its decay, black liberation could be achieved only through the proletarian revolution in which blacks as an oppressed and critically placed section of the working class would play a role far beyond what simple numbers would indicate. Since Trotsky’s contributions on this question in the late 1930’s, his centrist “followers” had decided that black liberation was a first stage which would be coupled to a future second stage of proletarian revolution:
 either that black nationalism was in itself progressive (the modern-day SWP), that the blacks’ democratic demands were irrelevant and frequently an obstacle (the Healyite Workers’ League), or that integration of blacks and whites under capitalism was a necessity before socialism could be achieved (the Spartacist League). The restoration of a Trotskyist analysis of black liberation was a major advance and a pivotal guide to the struggles of the oppressed, in addition to being a blow against the theory of democratic demands as a necessary first stage. 
By the 1970’s the truth that the bourgeois-democratic movements could not achieve their goals under a crisis-ridden capitalism was becoming manifest. The petty-bourgeois movements, standing essentially for the democratic reforms of capitalism despite their revolutionary verbiage, came to a grinding halt. Gains won during the past period began to atrophy. Similarly, minimalist gains won by the trade unions under the petty-bourgeois reformist bureaucracy were now being gutted by inflation and unemployment. The surface post-World War II prosperity which had enabled the bureaucracy to have its Step 1 and which enabled the IS and the New Left to operate on a stagist basis was evaporating. Thus, the material basis for the old approach was disappearing. 
However, the working class eruptions that had challenged the first blows of the new period had receded by the early seventies. The U.S. bourgeoisie, still the dominant imperialist class, was able to fend off the dissipation of the boom for a short time with the compliance of the union bureaucracy. Despite the RSL’s understanding of the nature of the boom and the limitations of the liberation struggles, it was the temporary decline of these struggles and the feeble new economic upturns that lay behind the RSL’s recent collapse. The small, draining ponds left by the ebbing of the wave are the shallow material basis for the RSL’s sad and very old “new” politics. Indeed, the pronounced rightward direction of virtually all the centrist currents is derived from this eddy in the class struggle. 
The LRP is committed to drawing all the lessons of the RSL’s defeat. For the high hopes once raised by the RSL have turned to ashes. The only compensation for the tragedy of its degeneration is that the lessons can be analyzed and learned from; every such lesson deepens revolutionary understanding. Personal and psychological assessments, “wrong ideas” against “right ideas” have their limited importance, but serious disputes among revolutionaries are reflections of, and factors in, the class struggle. The differences represent the volatility of the objective conditions and the reaction of the various classes; this Lenin and Trotsky pointed out on innumerable occasions. 
For us to penetrate to the fundamental lessons it is necessary to reexamine two interrelated questions that have long been disputed on the left:
 the question of the vanguard party and the so-called Russian question, the degeneration of the Russian revolution. 
The Revolutionary Vanguard
For genuine communists, the building of a revolutionary party is fundamentally a struggle for class consciousness. Once workers understand their material interests, not just as good ideas or moral imperatives but as inescapable necessities, they will embrace revolution. Workers recognizing their self-interest will see the absolute need for the unity of their class in order to overthrow the bourgeoisie. They will see that there is no link between bourgeois (even bourgeois reformist) programs of any sort and the revolutionary proletarian program. “Advanced” bourgeois ideas are not the first stage of Marxist ideas but their mortal enemy. “Advanced” bourgeois consciousness is a tool for restricting and combating the development of working class consciousness, Marxism. “Step 1” is inimical to “Step 2.” 
But since uneven economic and political development is an absolute law of capitalism, different layers of the working class achieve different levels of understanding of their material interests and how to fight for them. This differentiation appears in struggle as different rates of development. Thus Marxists speak of advanced workers, those who are revolutionists, and backward workers, who do not yet see the need for world revolution. 
Revolutionary consciousness is not a matter of education in any narrow sense. Real consciousness comes from combat, the struggle between the classes, struggle in acts as well as ideas which are in turn derived from action, past and present. For Marxists, the only proof of consciousness (or of theories of any sort) lies in the test of practice, the living class struggle. The decisive role in such events is played by revolutionaries, who draw the lessons and point out the necessity of communism at every stage, and counteract the lessons of defeatism drawn by petty-bourgeois elements. The working class continually generates and regenerates its consciousness—that is, its revolutionary leadership, the vanguard party. In the course of its struggle the proletariat selects from its own ranks and from other strata of society those who will lead the fight for proletarian interests. 
As Lenin pointed out, both the old petty bourgeoisie and the new middle class of intellectuals, professionals, bureaucrats, etc. are ground between the rising proletariat and the centralizing bourgeoisie in the imperialist epoch. The intellectual thus comes to recognize the impotence of his own social layer. Caught between the decisive classes in capitalist society, the propertyless intelligentsia thinks of itself as altruistic, objective, materially disinterested and a force for good against evil. Sections of this class become radicalized and play a role in the workers’ movement. 
So long as they break decisively from the world outlook of the middle class intelligentsia (even its most radical extreme), individual intellectuals can aid the proletariat, which must carefully sift and test them. But as a layer the intelligentsia can be and has been extremely dangerous for the working class. The radical intellectuals who grow cynical about the potential of the workers’ revolution (as well as those workers who are drawn into their orbit) come to a different view of the vanguard party. The defeats that the working class has suffered in the epoch of imperialist decay, most notably the degeneration of the Russian revolution, are the objective material grist for the mills of fatalism and defeatism concerning the revolutionary capacity of the proletariat. 
Confident that superior education provides him with science and understanding to lead the downtrodden to victory, and because his own class demonstrably lacks the capacity to change society, the radical intellectual turns to the masses—frequently the peasantry or the “people” in general (including certain powerful but excluded sectors of the bourgeoisie), and in the most mature situations, the working class. In order to change a society which appears degrading and anarchic to the intellectual he tries to manipulate the masses to achieve his own goals:
 the rationalization of capitalism, meaning planfulness rather than anarchy, order rather than chaos and decay, and economic security rather than poverty. 
In the hands of such petty-bourgeois radicals the vanguard party becomes not the embodiment of the Marxist program, the steeled cadres and general staff of the proletariat, but a tool wielded by intellectuals “in the name of the working class” or as “servants of the people.” Instead of a weapon of workers who are conscious of their own real material interests, it becomes an instrument of those who seek to aid the workers’ cause by manipulating the workers themselves. Fatalistically convinced that the actual proletariat cannot accomplish its tasks, the intellectual assumes that his own subjective “socialist” beliefs are an adequate replacement for the unachievable Marxist consciousness of the workers. The party designed by such types bravely adopts the bright man’s burden and nobly attempts to become the “condescending savior” of the masses. 
Such is the organization that the RSL leadership is in the process of creating. It attempts to manipulate the radical workers by publicly lying in the Torchand to its own membership. Having forgotten any other methodology, Taber and his friends learned to maneuver program, principles and the few workers they can lead. They learned from their “success” in the faction fight (the majority succeeded in expelling the minority) that manipulation is an efficient and therefore good weapon. Although the glories of the proletariat are proclaimed when they are remembered, this is done only to cover the reality of substituting petty maneuvers for the conscious acts of the working class. That is, they have abandoned the building of the vanguard party. 
In so doing they have wiped out the RSL’s original reason for existence. They have adopted the stagist outlook of the petty bourgeoisie within the workers’ movement. Their “socialist” Step 2 is a cover for the bourgeois limits (democratic and trade union demands) they impose on the first stage, but even covers have their material reality. The purpose of the second stage, in the face of the deepening bourgeois crisis, is to try to get rid of capitalism’s anarchy (or at least to paper it over and postpone its consequences). The function of the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia is to present or to apologize for an advanced form of state monopoly capitalism or its state capitalist aspect as the content behind the covering words of Step 2. This is why the “Russian question” is so vital. Every previous strand of Trotsky’s “successors” has taken such a course and the RSL is now on its way. 
The “Russian Question”
The cynicism of the RSL and the centrists, primarily cynicism towards the revolutionary potential of the working class, is far more pervasive and deep than any momentary phenomenon. Its wellspring in this epoch is the defeat of the Russian revolution. 
The source of the cynicism is not fundamentally the theories of the nature of the USSR—”degenerated workers’ state,” “bureaucratic collectivism” or “state capitalism”—but the actual, material degeneration of the Russian workers’ state itself. This meant not only the end of workers’ power in Russia but it gave rise as well to the Stalinist regime and its minions abroad who have effectively bolstered world capitalism by restraining and defeating the proletariat in its course toward revolution. The cynicism and the authoritarian anti-Marxist methods used by the Stalinists to maintain themselves in power have been a corrosive disease within the workers’ movement, affecting virtually all sectors of the proletariat. 
As part of its task in regenerating revolutionary Marxism the RSL had to come to grips with the “Russian question,” the class nature of the USSR. It concluded that Trotsky’s theory that the Soviet Union was still a degenerated workers’ state was no longer valid. Trotsky had expected that World War II would lead to an overturn in Russia, either a workers’ political revolution to revitalize the proletarian state or a bourgeois counterrevolution. To the Trotskyists of that period, Russia was a rapidly degenerating workers’ state, a “hollow shell” that could not withstand a war. Likewise, the Communist Parties were considered to be heading for disintegration; they were reformist (or nearly so) and counterrevolutionary. Had the expected post-war revolutions occurred, Trotsky’s mistaken analysis would have been seen as misleading. 
But the USSR and the Communist Parties made sure that the postwar workers’ uprisings were crushed. Stalinism survived the war and expanded its hegemony to Eastern Europe and Asia. This was possible because Russia’s degeneration had already transformed the Soviet workers’ state into its opposite by the end of the 1930’s. The purge of every vestige of working class leadership stemming from the October Revolution and the congealing of the bureaucratic caste into a self-interested and self-confident class announced the victory of capitalism in the Soviet Union by the time of the great purge trials. Far from being a hollow shell with a thin divided petty-bourgeois caste controlling a society alien to it, Russia had now a strong bourgeois regime based upon the crushing of the once-revolutionary Russian proletariat. Similarly, the Communist Parties did not weaken but grew enormously, and were powerful enough to chain the workers of Western Europe to their bourgeoisies in the name of “Bolshevism,” thus aborting the anticipated post-war revolutions. Stalinism proved to be a reinforcer of world capitalism that developed capitalism’s long-term tendencies toward centralization and statification to a point which the shareholding sections of the bourgeoisie could never reach. It was a system whose strength was based on the achievements and then the defeat of the world’s only proletarian state. 
The bulk of the Trotskyist movement under the guidance of Michel Pablo tried to adhere to Trotsky’s words (”degenerated workers’ state”) even though their content had been refitted. By the end of the 1940’s the Fourth International had labeled the new Stalinist states as “deformed” workers’ states despite the counterrevolutionary role of the Russian army and the ruling Communist Parties in smashing the working classes in order to seize power. These petty-bourgeois formations were credited with the fundamental proletarian tasks of overthrowing capitalism and making the socialist revolution. Such a theory represented the worst cynicism towards the working class in that it saw “workers’ states” built upon workers’ defeats! With the increasing number of “deformed workers’ states” proving each day that the Stalinist accession to power is no accident or exceptional case but a general phenomenon, the workers who heeded the Pabloites were taught to discount the absolute necessity of the proletariat making its own revolution. 
Defeatist Theories
Trotsky had pointed out that maintaining the theory of Russia as a degenerated workers’ state was a defense of revolutionary optimism. The theories which proclaimed Russia to be no longer a workers’ state, because they recognized the defeat of the proletariat in the overthrow of the Soviet workers’ state, opened the door to a defeatism towards the proletariat. Those who gave up on the gains of the Russian revolution too quickly and too easily were likely to give up on other gains of the workers like trade unions and the revolutionary vanguard party and therefore on the revolutionary capability of the working class itself. The crushing of the workers’ state called into question the power of the proletariat to achieve socialism. In Trotsky’s words:
 
“The historic alternative, carried to the end, is as follows: 
 either the Stalin regime is an abhorrent relapse in the process of transforming bourgeois society into a socialist society, or the Stalin regime is the first stage of a new exploiting society. If the second prognosis proves to be correct, then, of course, the bureaucracy will become a new exploiting class. However onerous the second perspective may be, if the world proletariat should actually prove incapable of fulfilling the mission placed upon it by the course of development, nothing else would remain except only to recognize that the socialist program, based on the internal contradictions of capitalist society, ended as a Utopia. It is self-evident that a new ‘minimum’ program would be required—for the defense of the interests of the slaves of the totalitarian bureaucratic society.” (From “The USSR in War,” In Defense of Marxism, p. 9)
Trotsky’s foreboding that the abandonment of the gains of the October revolution would lead to defeatism and the surrender of the revolutionary program proved to be essentially right. Shachtman fell into the trap with his break from the Fourth International. He put forth the view that Russia was neither bourgeois nor proletarian but a new form of slave society (”bureaucratic collectivism”) which was more dynamic than capitalism. This system was a fulfillment of Trotsky’s “second prognosis” in which only a fight for the minimal rights of slaves was called for. Although Shachtman was often forced by his pragmatism to refer to “workers” rather than “slaves,” he did reduce the program to “the struggle for democracy.” And although initially he denied Trotsky’s charge of defeatism by claiming that Stalinism was limited to one country, his program became a democratic Step 1 for all countries. That is, Shachtman saw the world as a three-cornered struggle between capitalism, bureaucratic collectivism and the “third camp” of socialism; he inevitably came to the defense of capitalism against bureaucratic collectivism because the new dynamic society that so effectively subordinated the masses was a threat to democracy and trade unionism and the socialist alternative was “obviously” a far-distant Step 2. 
In giving up on the proletariat and linking himself to what he saw as “the forces for democracy,” Shachtman entered upon the road through the various Step 1’s that we have already described. In the course of his various Socialist Party and Democratic Party ventures, his organization came to see itself as the grand maneuverer, shifting the proletariat into position to see the several Step 1’s more clearly. Shachtman finally came to the correct conclusion that the trade union bureaucracy could maneuver with far greater strength than he for the goals he had come to adopt as his own. There was no longer any need for a vanguard party; all that was required was a coterie of “democratic and trade union”-conscious advisors attached to the ear of George Meany. 
The early state capitalist theories that were devised in opposition to Shachtman, Pablo and Trotsky also carried out the logic of Trotsky’s prediction. One of the first of these was that of Johnson (C.L.R. James) and Forest (Raya Dunayevskaya), who had split with Shachtman from the Fourth International but later rejoined the SWP for a few years. They regarded Russia as capitalist because they saw Marx’s law of value at work in the Russian economy. However, Lenin and Marx had recognized that the workers’ state that emerged after the socialist revolution (a “bourgeois state without the bourgeoisie”) would necessarily utilize bourgeois tools for a definite period—including wage labor and other economic forms as well as the state—in its struggle against the remnants of the bourgeoisie and against bourgeois (i.e., backward) consciousness. It is not the forms alone which are utilized. A workers’ state is still bourgeois until it accumulates abundance to lay the basis for communism. Hence the law of capitalist accumulation, the law of value, still operates. In the economic sphere the struggle takes the form of a struggle between socialist consciousness—planning according to the needs of the masses—and the law of value. 
In rejecting the Stalinist state as capitalist because of the law of value, Johnson and Forest could no longer distinguish between the Leninist workers’ state (law of value and all) and the new Stalinism. They rejected the very meaning of the workers’ state:
 the triumph of advanced workers’ consciousness. Since the embodiment of this advanced consciousness is the vanguard party, it is no accident that the Johnson-Forest tendency became known for its worship of spontaneism, the notion that the workers would instinctively throw up dual-power institutions such as soviets without revolutionary leadership. Soviets by themselves, however, represent only democratic institutions of the class. In 1917, it was the Marxist program fought for in the Soviets by the Bolsheviks that made them socialist institutions for the revolutionary seizure of power. Without socialist leadership the democratic institutions not only provide no solution for the workers, they enable the one remaining “solution” to triumph—reaction, which among other things destroys democracy. 
Like the nineteenth century anarchists who fought against Marx’s insistence on the proletarian dictatorship, James took the logical step of replacing the vanguard party by the only possible alternative to lead the way to “socialism”:
 the Bonapartist ruler who interprets “the will of the people” for their own good by appearing to stand above the class struggle. Thus James at various times accepted the (Step 1) leadership of “great men” like Fidel Castro, Eric Williams of Trinidad-Tobago, Kwame Nkrumah, Julius Nyerere et al. With C. L.R. James as their proposed advisor, their platonic dictatorships (”guided democracy”) would gradually prepare the proletariat to rule. Giving up on the vanguard party led James to give up on the proletariat and to return to a classic petty-bourgeois scheme for manipulating the masses. 
Also, without the vanguard party to overcome capitalist economic laws, Johnson-Forest saw the all-pervasive law of value bringing about a new epoch of state capitalism. Lenin’s analysis of this century as the epoch of capitalist decay was thereby shattered—for James, but not in reality. 
The theory of “bureaucratic state capitalism” promulgated by Tony Cliff and adopted by the British International Socialists was somewhat different. It denied the internal operation of the law of value in Russia and was therefore akin to bureaucratic collectivism. The logic of Cliff’s position is that Russian capitalism without the law of value has no proletarian class struggle and therefore no tendency towards crisis and decay. Such a society, although Cliff does not say so, must be progressive in comparison to Western capitalism. Nevertheless, Cliff learned from the horrors of Stalinism’s triumph that the vanguard party is too dangerous a tool to play with, and he turned to notions of the “independent rank and file.” When he subsequently returned to the advocacy of a vanguard party, it became (as with Shachtman and James) an instrument for manipulating rank and file struggles which the “vanguard” kept from becoming political by reserving political wisdom to itself. The IS’s support for General Carvalho’s “apolitical” Bonapartist dreams in Portugal was a perfectly consistent application of Cliff’s method. Cliff’s anti-Stalinism reduces to “anti-leadership” rhetoric that is designed to leave power over the masses in the hands of skilled manipulators with, of course, the masses’ best interests at heart. 
The conception of a dynamic new system—bureaucratic collectivism, the epoch of state capitalism, or bureaucratic state capitalism—which displaces the proletariat as the successor to state monopoly capitalism must at bottom see the working class as impotent or as a tool useful for its militant weight but not for its Marxist consciousness. All these versions followed the path Trotsky foresaw and dropped the vanguard party in favor of a variety of stagism. Like Pabloism, the other “Trotskyist” successor theory, they placed their faith in bourgeois or petty-bourgeois elements within or above the working class (Bonapartists, Stalinists, or Social-Democrats) as the only reliable forces that could hold out against the decay of capitalism. Each of these tendencies, born out of defeatism and cynicism towards the working class, moved into a position of supporting the very misleaderships responsible for the defeats and cynicism in the first place. 
The Workers’ State
The various “successor” theories to Trotsky developed out of the decline of the Fourth International. The victory of the Stalinist counterrevolution against the great October revolution, the destruction of the proletariat’s massive achievement, had its impact even upon those who fought against it. The cynicism which spewed forth into the workers’ movement as a result of Stalinism engulfed even the Trotskyists. The RSL had begun the process of rejecting these theories born out of defeat, but its early and incomplete efforts were cut short and are now being rolled back. 
It is absolutely necessary for any tendency which asserts revolutionary Marxism and believes Russia to be a degenerated workers’ state to critically examine its own theory and the theory’s history, in order to account for its inability to predict the expansion of Stalinism or to come to terms with the modern imperialist world. Such a tendency must also explain and change those elements of the theory (since they wrongly hold that it is not the theory itself) which have enabled so many to capitulate openly to the bourgeoisie, both the Stalinists and their own rulers. They must account as well for the causes of this degeneration in material and class terms. 
Any proponent of a “state capitalist” theory has a similar obligation. How is it that the early practitioners from James to Cliff (as well as Urbahns and those of the ‘30’s) have made such obvious capitulations? Does not Trotsky’s prediction prove that any notion of Russian state capitalism leads to disaster? It is insufficient to castigate the other theories and claim that now the lessons have learned. The IS “knew” that it was made of sterner stuff than Shachtman yet it fell into the same traps. Since Shachtman, James et al fell by the wayside by overestimating Stalinism’s capacities, it is necessary for us to begin by weighing Stalinism’s achievements against those of the Soviet workers’ state. 
It is fundamental for Marxists to realize that “state capitalism” could never have come into existence without the proletarian revolution. It did not just happen that way historically; it was the only possible channel. No Russian bourgeoisie, indeed no bourgeoisie at all, could have nationalized, concentrated and centralized the means of production to enable Russia to expand as it did. Russia is now the second most powerful nation in the world and maintains a far greater imperial sway than the Czars ever envisioned. Even though the degree of state consolidation of industry was already high under the Czars, the bourgeoisie could not forge the separate capitals into one in the face of capitalism’s anarchic economic laws and, most important, out of fear of the revolutionary potential of the organized proletariat. 
When the Soviet Union was still a workers’ state, Trotsky summarized the workers’ conquests in this way:
 
“Gigantic achievements in industry, enormously promising beginnings in agriculture, an extraordinary growth of the old industrial cities and a building of new ones, a rapid increase in the number of workers, a rise in cultural level and cultural demands - such are the indubitable results of the October revolution, in which the prophets of the old world tried to see the grave of human civilization. With the bourgeois economists we have no longer anything to quarrel over. Socialism has demonstrated its right to victory, not on the pages of Das Kapital, but in an industrial arena comprising a sixth part of the earth’s surface—not in the language of dialectics, but in the language of steel, cement, and electricity. Even if the Soviet Union, as a result of internal difficulties, external blows and the mistakes of its leadership, were to collapse—which we firmly hope will not happen—there would remain as an earnest of the future this indestructible fact, that thanks solely to a proletarian revolution a backward country has achieved in less than ten years successes unexampled in history.” (The Revolution Betrayed, p.9)
Russian growth took off in the 1930’s but was due to the accomplishments of 1917. The enforced series of economic quotas and allocations known under Stalinism as planning, the state monopoly of foreign trade, the state-controlled credit and banking system, etc., rested upon the breakthroughs of the workers’ revolution. The self-sacrifice under brutal conditions of the working class that thought it was creating socialism depended on the fact that the USSR was still a workers’ state, although degenerating rapidly. Russia made substantial gains during the Depression, when the capitalist powers were foundering, not because of its Stalinist bureaucracy but because of its original proletarian consolidation and its remaining proletarian character. 
No other Stalinist-ruled country has been able to accomplish what the workers achieved in Russia. What gains the others have made in industry and centralization are due in large part to the existence of the Russian model and to the strength afforded to the new bureaucracies by Russian power. But none of these nations have been able to consolidate in any way approaching the earlier strides taken by the USSR. The Chinese Maoists, for example, have never been able to integrate and effectively centralize China’s economy; China still lies open to imperial domination from Russia and the West. The North Korean economy for all its self-trumpeting and forced development is in shambles, heavily in debt and in default to Western banks. Those Eastern European states which are economically advanced got their start under the rising bourgeoisie of the last century, not under state capitalism, and in fact they are now severely restrained by Russian imperialism. “State capitalism” is far from being a new dynamic system able to overcome capitalist decay and outdistance state monopoly capitalism. The fact is that Russia and all the Stalinist countries are utterly dependent upon shareholding capitalism in the West. The fact that they do not generate new levels of technology without which no industrial state can accumulate or even maintain itself is one proof of this. 
“State capitalism” is part of the world system of state monopoly capitalism. Capitalism turns to partial statification in its epoch of decay in order to maintain its individuated private property character. But partial statification is frequently insufficient. State capitalism is another aspect of the system, one whose special function is to bolster the decaying world capitalist system as a whole. Where capitalism in its traditional anarchic form can no longer defeat or contain the proletarian struggle, where it can no longer maintain sick and profitless but vital industries, here state capitalism steps into the breach. After World War II, state capitalism on the Russian model triumphed in economically imperiled countries whose old bourgeoisies could no longer rule in the old way and whose working classes had been eliminated as contenders for power. In the face of the proletariat, all forms of capitalism strive to hold together despite their basic rivalries and different forms of property ownership. The destruction of the sanctity of property held private from the working class by a socialist revolution anywhere is a deadly threat to all. 
Even though state capitalism represents the limit of capitalist tendencies toward statification and centralization, it is not the historical outcome of capitalist development. In those state capitalist countries like Russia and parts of Eastern Europe where the economy has approached an advanced level, the laws of capitalist anarchy are reappearing as open and decisive factors, with a vengeance. Internal competition has to be reintroduced for the sake of efficiency, and the working class has to be kept divided through unequal rewards. On the other hand, in the traditional advanced capitalist countries hit by severe crises, state capitalist nationalization is regarded with hostility by the ruling classes because of the danger from the powerful proletariat. The bourgeoisie in crisis turns to renewed imperialism and intensified repression at home. The future, if the proletarian revolution is long delayed, will see a world of decaying state monopoly capitalism—with their attendant militarism, Bonapartism, fascism and war. 
Far from being a new stage in history supplanting the epoch of state monopoly capitalism described by Lenin, state capitalism is a facet of degenerating state monopoly capitalism, a temporary and dangerous expedient. All sections of the bourgeoisie find that a statified national capital is impossible to administer for long on a bourgeois basis. Statified, concentrated and centralized capital is the final, logical limit of capitalist developmentwhich can only be maintained and then transcended by the proletarian state. The only conceivable circumstance under which a “state capitalist epoch” or a “bureaucratic collectivism” could exist would be another, more cataclysmic defeat of the world working classes. As Trotsky demonstrated, Marxists cannot remain Marxists while basing their actions on such a cynical, defeatist and fatalist perspective. 
The RSL and State Capitalism
The RSL had taken important steps towards a Marxist understanding of state capitalism but it never felt obliged to make its own analysis systematic nor to engage in the dialectically related task of making a systematic analysis of rival theories. It failed to take on a task that Marx, Lenin and Trotsky would never have let slip by. For example, the faction fight inside the IS that produced the RSL avoided the Russian question, despite the IS’s historical link with Shachtman. The degenerated “degenerated workers’ state” theory of the Pabloites was occasionally swiped at but never given a serious treatment. And other state capitalist theories were never dealt with publicly. In its uncompleted internal documents the RSL had begun to accept the fact that workers’ gains were still embodied, even in negation, in state capitalism. However, little importance was attached to it. This understanding rarely saw the light of day in its public press, that which attempts to convince advanced workers. 
Now with the recent turn such a world view has to be abandoned altogether. In Taber’s recent series of articles in the Torch(March 15 through May 15) the RSL’s new version receives its authoritative treatment. Nowhere in three extensive articles is there the conception that Russia’s dynamism was not due to Stalinism but to the proletarian revolution, whose impact on state capitalism is totally ignored. What Taber writes of the period of rapid industrialization is the following:
 
“Meanwhile, having destroyed the kulak threat, Stalin and the apparatus turned on the workers. The bureaucracy was now able to feel its independent strength, based on its control of the state and state production, more than ever before. It had routed the immediate threat to its power. Now, with millions of peasants pouring into the cities to escape starvation in the devastated countryside, Stalin had a reserve labor force with which to batter the workers and force down their wages and working conditions. Between 1928 and 1933 the workday was lengthened to 10 or more hours per day while wages were cut in half. Wage differentials were increased far beyond what existed in the western capitalist states. Piecework, which Marx had termed the method of production ‘most suitable to capitalism,’ was reintroduced. ‘Socialist emulation’ was transformed into the code-name for almost unbearably vicious speed-up. What protection had been offered by the trade unions was eliminated. All in all, Stalin’s apparatus was establishing the preconditions for capitalist rule through the state power.”
Taber is obviously correct in pointing to the monstrously anti-working class character of the Stalinist industrialization policies. But his treatment is dangerously one-sided:
 while Trotsky left no opportunity unused to catalogue Stalin’s crimes, he also cited the enormous strides made by the still-proletarian Soviet Union, as we have already shown. In the RSL’s version the achievements of the Russian economy are purely the products of Stalinism’s brutal oppression. The idea is not new with Taber. 
“The modern Stalinist bureaucracy has to its credit the development of an industrial basis for the socialist reorganization of Russian society which Russian capitalism was never able to achieve and which the Russian socialist working class, left in the lurch by the proletariat of the West, could not hope to carry out by itself.”
So wrote Max Shachtman. The thought was a stock-in-trade for bureaucratic collectivist theory. Just substitute bourgeoisie for bureaucracy and there stands Taber’s theory in what is only a more explicit form. 
The same parallel is repeated in a slightly different way. According to Taber:
 
“But rather than openly proclaiming itself as capitalist and its victory the triumph of state capitalism, the state-capitalist bourgeoisie continued to drape itself in the flag of Marx, Engels and Lenin—in the banner of the proletarian revolution. This ideological cover has served exceptionally well as an aid to the police and military apparatus as a means of propping up the system and warding off the danger of proletarian overthrow.”
To see the Stalinists’ ideological proletarianism as a mere “aid” and disguise rather than an indispensable feature is to grant state capitalism credit for an internal strength that no capitalist society retains in this epoch. This is another leaf from Shachtman’s book. Stalinist “Marxism” is not a mere “masquerade,” as Shachtman claimed, which could be removed or replaced by an alternative disguise. All too easily, the drape or masquerade theory lends itself to a view of Stalinism as a diabolical conspiracy rather than an aspect of the bourgeois social system. The proletarian cover is an absolute necessity for a ruling class that rests on the negation of a working class revolution. Even in countries like China where the Maoist revolution was in no sense made by or even with the proletariat, the regime is forced to establish its relation to the working class. The state capitalist attempt to create a modern ordered nation-state where older forms of capitalism are unable to do so requires a drive to advance production and accumulate. This is impossible without winning over at least a section of the only creative class in society, the proletariat; hence their attempts to create a labor aristocracy and garner a measure of support while dividing the working class. The fact that these attempts fail over time does not contradict the absolutely necessary relation between the Stalinist ruling class and its new labor lieutenants. Without the Marxist proletarian cover, state capitalism would not only be ideologically weaker but would stand exposed as a usurper and be unable to play its role as a world prop for decaying capitalism. 
Imputing the enormous leap in production of the USSR to a dynamic Stalinism has disastrous consequences for a Trotskyist. The theory of permanent revolution is based on the understanding that the fundamental tasks of the bourgeois revolution cannot be carried out by the bourgeoisie in the epoch of its decay; only the workers’ revolution can do so. If Stalinism is adequate for the job then permanent revolution, the strategy for the socialist revolution in this epoch, can be given lip service but fundamentally must be cast aside in favor of a stage theory:
 bourgeois (minimal) demands can be achieved without the socialist revolution. That is just what the RSL has done. 
In its campaign to pick Shachtman’s pocket the RSL is coming to see Stalinism as a new society too. After years of experiencing the IS’s “third camp” notions and the Jamesian and Cliffite notions of a new epoch, the RSL strove to return to Lenin’s understanding that no new epoch was on the agenda - that the struggle was between proletariat and bourgeoisie. But the RSL never reached the point of proving that a “new bourgeois class” was incompatible with its world view, so the road was left open for Taber’s steps backward. 
The Taber essays are replete with references to capitalism’s tendencies towards monopolization, concentration, centralization and statification. He notes that the “logical” conclusion of these tendencies is state capitalism, and duly observes that the traditional capitalists “violently oppose this end result.” Like every observer (Trotsky, Shachtman, Cliff, etc.), Taber points out that Stalinism acts as a prop for world capitalism. 
But Taber never once sees fit to mention that state capitalism is a system in crisis! He overlooks state capitalism’s subjection to the cyclical crises that affect all capitalist societies. He ignores the effects of the epoch of decay on the state capitalist countries (and even suggests that they are able to withstand these effects:
 “Although this growth is limited, partial and occurs at the expense of the stability of capitalism as a whole, it is a significant attraction to many of the world’s masses.”) And he fails entirely to see that capitalist decay means that state capitalism decays in the direction of anarchic state monopoly capitalism. The picture emerges of a society that solves the masses’ most fundamental problems—certainly with brutality and waste, but solves them nevertheless. Such a society must be a new phenomenon (even if the RSL’s formal theory stops short of this conclusion), a new stage that revives the old “third camp” world view. The IS stopped short, verbally, of Shachtman’s conclusions, but their theory led them down the same path. So too for the RSL. 
Inevitably, any concession towards a supposedly crisis-free capitalism leads to downplaying the proletarian struggle. Thus it is no accident that Taber leaves out the workers’ revolts against Stalinism. There is repression galore, the ruling class is able to “blunt” the class struggle, the Russian army invades Eastern Europe—but never do the masses act, in Taber’s account. Not that Taber is unaware that the proletariat continues to struggle against oppression; any schoolchild knows of the conflict within the Stalinist countries. The Torchwrites about it often enough. The problem for Taber is that he can’t account for it theoretically, because his theory is designed to distinguish between, not identify, Eastern and Western capitalism. How explain Liberman, Sik, Dubcek, Tito and their reintroduction of market forms and controlled competitive prices if state capitalism is the last resort of capitalism? To avoid this problem Taber avoids the obvious decay of the Stalinist system and thereby allows only a journalistic account of the masses’ role in the history of the Stalinist countries. 
The avoidance of any attempt to understand the tendencies for the unitary forms of state capitalism to break down into approximations of the competitive forms of state monopoly capitalism is not simply an oversight. It stems from the view of state capitalism as a successor state to state monopoly capitalism and as the logical outcome of capitalist development under the bourgeoisie. Its consequences are in line with the capitulations the RSL makes in its stagist view of Western capitalism (the initial struggle for democratic and reform demands). This is exactly the program of the majority of the bourgeois liberal dissidents in the USSR, the elements who most dearly reflect the reassertion of openly anarchic capitalism. While Marxists defend the rights of the liberals against the Stalinists, to confuse our banner with theirs is a capitulation and a disaster. The RSL at this point has no intention of confusing banners but theoretically the question is left open. Once again, the experience of the IS in not really breaking from Shachtman’s theory is directly relevant. 
The reversion of the RSL back toward the earlier non-workers’ state theories of the USSR is now under way. Its advances in understanding the Russian question had not sufficiently transcended the problems of defeatism and cynicism lodged in the previous anti-Marxist theories. The RSL’s failure to examine the capitulations made by the earlier state capitalists meant that the RSL still suffered from the same defeatism. Today, we can see that its once revolutionary but incomplete analysis of the USSR was one important source of the cynical theory and practice that it has adopted in its degeneration. Reciprocally the RSL’s decay causes its theory of Stalinism to display even more cynicism towards the proletariat. It is not accidental that the various earlier theories of state capitalism and bureaucratic collectivism were developed during periods of working class defeats. The RSL’s theory was accelerated by the workers’ upsurge of the 1960’s and its theoretical capitulation stems from tailing the present consciousness of backward and cynical petty-bourgeois layers in the working class. 
Whatever the RSL might now say against the evils of bureaucratism becomes increasingly difficult to believe in the light of its glorification of its own internal bureaucracy and its adoption of the petty-bourgeois cynic’s view of the proletariat. To downplay the workers’ fight against Stalinism means, necessarily, to understand the world from the bureaucratic vantage point, to see it from the top down. From this point of view, the strength of state capitalist production comes from the Stalinist bureaucrats, their actions and maneuvers. George Meany and a Stalinist bureaucrat disagree yet share the same understanding of who controls events. They are now joined by a minor league compatriot, Taber. If the Stalinists could “maneuver” the working class into overthrowing one form of capitalism in favor of a more advantageous form, then he too can maneuver the working class towards his own version of Step 1. The RSL leadership has unwittingly made the connection between its theory and practice all too clear. 
Thus the RSL leadership has capitulated, and the organization as a whole is rapidly degenerating into centrism. Centrism is an inherently vacillating the phenomenon which serves the interests of capitalism by waylaying the most advanced workers and keeping them away from revolutionary action. Centrism’s revolutionary rhetoric promises revolution as a far-off Step 2 in exchange for a “realistic” or reformist practice in the present stage. Its vacillating quality arises from the pressure of the advanced workers, in or outside of its ranks, who conflict with the practice imposed by the leadership. To call a group centrist is not to use a swear word but a precise label for this unstable, imprecise phenomenon. 
For the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia and its allies in the labor aristocracy, centrism is a lasting condition. The “centrism” of the masses, on the other hand, is the process the workers go through while searching for, weighing and finally selecting its revolutionary leadership; it is a passing phenomenon on the road to power. 
The RSL has already made all of the theoretical concessions to bourgeois thought typical of centrism, and now its practice is moving into line. Its trade union propaganda typically calls for the ranks to “organize independently” of the bureaucracy, as if organization without revolutionary politics is the solution revolutionaries have to offer. It counterposes “rank and file organization” to revolutionary leadership. With the exception of overseas events (safely distant from the RSL’s purview!) the necessity of revolutionary leadership for workers’ struggles is ignored in the RSL’s public press. 
The “rank and file,” however, contains within it many different levels of consciousness, political tendencies and leaderships. “Rank and file leadership” in the trade unions can only mean the least common denominator of all out-of-office tendencies and therefore amounts to the program of the left bureaucrats whose road to power is through “rank and file” caucuses. It is therefore a stagist conception, a surrender to reformist practice. 
The RSL is moving to the right in the wake of the various centrist groups. The material basis for stagism and reformism which existed on the surface in the post-war decades has eroded. In the 1970’s, the trend in the U.S. has been towards struggles of a conservative and bewildered working class which had known a degree of prosperity and now faced a frightening and unexpected economic collapse. Although there was hostility to the bureaucratic leadership of the unions this consciousness did not coalesce politically and did not make its weight felt. Even this militancy receded, however, as the U.S. bourgeoisie reasserted a shadow of its past international and internal economic power. The temporary and slight economic upturn—which may now even be ended—signified to workers the possibility of a return to the days when reforms and benefits could grow in a linear fashion. This mini-upturn, this puff of wind, is the material “reality” that has sent the centrists sailing to the right with the RSL scurrying after them. The RSL has proven itself unable to withstand this feeble a test. 
The RSL is on the road to centrism. In declining to affirm that it has already reached that goal we stand with Trotsky:
 do not give up on the gains of the working class until they have been lost without a doubt. As the RSL is a propaganda group with little direct impact on events, the signs of its outright betrayal of the workers in practice need not come right away. Just as the RSL was created out of the mass struggles of the late 1960’s, the next upsurge of the proletariat will provide the decisive test for the RSL in its decay. That same upsurge, whose signs can already be detected on an international scale, will produce not only centrists but Bolshevik cadres, the leadership whose steadfastness will have been tested as well in times of adversity, by its fight “against the stream.” Acceptance of cynicism is the common coin of all tendencies save Bolshevism in the world today. To the forging of a leadership which is the product of a renewed and fighting working class we dedicate the League for the Revolutionary Party.

The Black Panther Party has openly split into two warring factions. A precise statement of the political differences between them is impossible, such is the atmosphere of vituperation and counter-accusation. The group round Eldridge Cleaver and the New York Chapter (branch) charge the Oakland, California leadership of Huey Newton with ‘revisionism’, while the Newton group characterise the opposition as ‘adventurists’.
The fratricidal struggle is so intense that recent murders of two party members has been attributed by the Panther leaders to factional warfare rather than to the police. Such tragic circumstances make it doubtful if any section of the Panthers can survive as a significant force. Furthermore, the split is bound to have severe effects on the whole Black Liberation Movement.
The Black Panther Party heroically withstood a massive police campaign of terror and assassination. The reasons for the present disintegration are to be found in the unresolved contradictions of the party’s political outlook and in objective changes in the American scene.
The contradictions of the Party, as well as its contribution to the developing movement in the us can only be understood when placed in historical context.
 
Origins of the Panthers
In the late 1950s the Civil Rights Movement developed in America, under the leadership of elements within the professional and student strata of the black community. It was the response of black, educated youth who aspired to upward social mobility and participation in the affluence of American society, but who found the number of professional and business jobs open to them absurdly small. However, one of its big accomplishments was to build up the expectations of virtually every other layer of black society. The initial breakthroughs on segregation, the changes in the civil rights laws and the victories in obtaining electoral rights held out the prospect of even deeper changes.
But the movement was unable to make further headway: in fact some of its victories proved illusory. The over-riding problems of the mass of the black community remained: huge unemployment, disproportionate wages, no access to skilled trades, lack of job security. And the daily life of the blacks was still slum housing, poor education, police brutality and social ostracism. The stripping away of archaic legal barriers to racial equality revealed the depth of racism and its linkage to the economic basis of capitalism.
When the dust cleared and the movement began to ebb, a new pattern of American racial life became clear. In the South an unequal coalition – undeclared but still operative – of urban white bourgeois elements and the black leadership maintained a token integration. In the North, black politicians received greater weight within the Democratic Party; there were more openings for blacks in the business world, the universities and the professions; a little anti-poverty money was channelled through the upper sections of the black community (with some trickling downward).
Alongside the Civil Rights Movement had also existed the Black Nationalist Movement, led by the Black Muslims. Although putting forward a far different programme from the Civil Rights movement, the Nation of Islam was motivated by the same demand for upward mobility. The Muslims, eschewing political and social action, proclaimed the need for a separate Black Nation, built upon black business run co-operatively by their group.
However, by the mid-sixties it was clear that both roads to improvement were doomed. The white power structure was slightly more dappled with black spots than before, but in a bourgeois context no real road forward was possible for blacks through either an integrationist or a separatist strategy. Sections of both wings of the black movement began to look in other directions.
The term ‘black power’ was coined to indicate the new aim. It maintained the social and political combativeness of the civil rights movement and continued the black consciousness of the nationalist tendency. It rejected the social quietism of the latter and the integrationist aim of the former. In juxtaposition to both, it openly proclaimed itself as revolutionary and dedicated to the abolition of capitalism. However, it provided no class analysis or means of organisation.
One such black power current was Stokeley Carmichael and SNCC. For this group capitalism was basically the ‘white system’, and they steadfastly refused to work with any section of the white community, unable to distinguish between potential allies and enemies. This view was mirrored by their refusal to acknowledge the class divisions within the black community.
In the mid-sixties insurrections broke out in the black ghettos of virtually every large urban community in the United States. They could properly be viewed as the first mass involvement of black people under their own initiative. The uprisings were a mixture of frustration and anger, sparked by the contradiction between awakened ambitions and the failure of the Civil Rights Movement to produce. The fuel for the flames was the growing consciousness of ‘Black Power’, the growing cohesiveness of black identity and assertion of self-respect. However, spontaneous uprisings, isolated from other sectors of society and without any ability to capture the levers of social control, were bound to have only very limited accomplishments. Underneath the surface it also became clear that an intact American power structure could ‘outgun’ the black community in any decisive test of armed might, although it could not maintain total ‘pacification’ of the ghettoes.
During the insurrections the Black Power organisations and leaders were able to vocalise the anguish of blacks but were unable to provide leadership, programme or organisation. The black community consisted of various class elements but SNCC and other black power groups were unable to give direction to the aspirations of any of them.
In this vacuum of leadership the Black Panther Party emerged. The Party became the organisational expression for embryonic ideas of Black Power. The Panthers pointed out that the spontaneous uprisings must give way to organisation with a programme of concrete goals and a strategy for achieving these goals. Only organisation in the black community could exercise anything but momentary power. The advocacy of armed self-defence must be understood as part of a comprehensive programme for black control of black communities and the protection of those communities from the occupying armies of the state.
 
Achievements of the Panthers
The Panthers also placed the question of ‘class’ on the agenda, thus differentiating themselves from both the Civil Rights leadership and the earlier ‘Black Power’ advocates. They put forward the view that the bourgeois blacks could never lead the struggle to win freedom for the black community. They held in common with SNCC that capitalism was the enemy but differed with SNCC as to what capitalism was. For the Panthers capitalism was not in essence a ‘white system’ to be combatted by blacks, but a class system to be fought by the majority of oppressed blacks and by oppressed whites.
Because the Black Panther Party held that the black community could only achieve liberation through an anti-capitalist strategy, it launched a bitter attack against the ‘cultural nationalist’ organisations. The Panthers distinguished within the Black Power Movement between themselves and those who saw the problem solely in race terms and thus accepted the capitalist class structure. Wearing a dashiki, an Afro hairdo and screaming against ‘whitey’ did not necessarily mean a break with capitalist society. Rather, the emphasis by the ‘cultural nationalists’ on cultural questions as opposed to political and social revolution meant accommodation to the status quo. Further, the Panthers trenchantly pointed out that the problem for black people was in coping with modern technology rather than in identification with tribal antecedents.
Finally, the Panthers counterposed themselves to the civil rights organisations and attacked the failure to see that for racism to be destroyed, capitalism must be destroyed. The civil rights organisations had over-emphasised a legalistic approach and become dependent on the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, even to the point of subordination of the Civil Rights Movement. The Panthers correctly characterised the Democratic Party as a bourgeois and racist institution, and refused to give support to any politician, black or white, who ran as a Democratic Party candidate.
The Black Panther Party rapidly developed into a national organisation with chapters in almost every urban centre with large concentrations of black people. Its base was largely the ‘brothers off the block’, young males who were unemployed or worked sporadically – the same group who had led the uprisings shortly before. They constitute a significant section of the black community. The Panthers, in their initial stages, also had at least the covert support and respect of broad layers of the stable, older working class sectors. (At the same time, it is important to note the extreme mixture of consciousness. Pictures of Martin Luther King and John Kennedy were still the ones to adorn the mantlepieces of black homes.)
 
And Their Failings
The Panthers were able to fashion a programme which, unlike the earlier movements, could speak to the needs and awakened aspirations in the black community. However there were certain contradictions in their approach. These can put into perspective their subsequent disintegration – a process which has been going on for some time and which the open faction fight only highlights.
Although the first significant organisation to see the struggle for liberation in terms of class cleavage in capitalist society, the Panthers did not have a socialist conception of the central role of the working class: an understanding of its capacity for self-organisation and its potential vanguard role. Instead, the conception of class conflict tended to stress the division between ‘rich’ and ‘poor’. This led the Panthers to concentrate upon the ‘lumpen proletariat’ within the community as the basic driving force.
The Panthers never made any systematic attempt to build black caucuses within the factories or unions but rather concentrated their thrust on ‘community-based’ programmes. The one Black Panther caucus which did exist – at the General Motors auto factory in Fremont, California – grew up independently of any real direction from the national leadership and was never accorded any priority. In Panther Chairman Bobby Seale’s book Seize the Time, the short discussion on the need for black workers to organise into caucuses is not accorded any more importance than the ‘Breakfast for Children’ programme. Black workers are seen at best, as another group it would be desirable to organise. The failure to recognise the critical role of the working class led to a number of concrete problems for the Panthers.
First, the Party’s orientation towards ‘street youth’ resulted in a very unstable base and as a result Panther membership was frequently like a revolving door. Furthermore, the Panther’s orientation towards this sector of the black community resulted in a rank and file which was difficult to control and would not act in a disciplined fashion. The leadership did not intend the emphasis on armed self-defence and the exaggerated significance of guns to mean immediate armed conflict with the police. But the membership did not always accept such an interpretation, and there was continual tension between the leadership and the rank and file over questions of adventurism. This conflict produced pressures pushing the organisation in an increasingly authoritarian direction. Although the leadership had initially. passed a whole series of rules relating to guns, drugs and liquor, it was unable to effectively discipline the rank and file. Instead it had to purge whole sections of the membership (and purges for purely political questions were also increasingly common). What resulted was centralism which was increasingly authoritarian, but which did not produce real cohesion in the organisation.
Marx pointed out many years ago (in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte) that the ‘lumpen proletariat’ cannot be organised democratically except as adjuncts of a larger proletarian movement. The leader who organises a lumpen proletariat base may succeed if he allows it to act in as volatile fashion as it wishes to; but should he try to check its actions, then his base will vanish. This was the dilemma continually confronting the Black Panther Party.
Reliance upon such elements was coupled with the ‘community control’ strategy of the Panthers, which looked to black people taking control of the geographical areas they live in. Institutions of control at present in the hands of the national bourgeois power – police, education, stores – were to be taken over by the inhabitants of the ghetto themselves.
This programme expressed the aspiration of blacks for a sense of power, for self-respect, for control over their own lives. It expressed the desire to alter the abysmal conditions of ghetto life and counterposed a grass roots control approach. It was in complete contrast to the programmes of ‘community control’ sometimes advanced by the government and by more conservative blacks, who were merely trying to place more black faces on local power bodies, to create a more substantive bourgeois structure within the ghetto and to provide a local black colouration for the national state power.
Unfortunately, however, the problems stemming from the Panthers’ own approach were overwhelming. The reality of the black ghettoes in the United States is that they are extremely atomised. Capitalism is forced to design its factories so as to bind workers together, establish cooperation among them, provide a clear enemy and situate them in a relationship to the productive core of social power. Contrarily, the ghetto is designed to fragment. Different classes with different social aims inhabit a geographical locale. No natural co-operation exists and enemies are everywhere. Ghettos are not ‘communities’ in the sense the term originally meant. Most importantly, the forces that actually control the ghetto are exterior. The means of production and the state organs are based outside the ghetto and unseizable by community based action alone.
A strategy based on the disorganised community could only lead to frustration and manoeuvring between the various class elements. Consequently, the Panthers gyrated between the two poles of reformist and adventurist action. Their emphasis vacillated between providing social services for the community such as ‘Breakfast for Children’ and ‘People’s Hospitals’, and a military solution for the problem of liberation in which the gun became the central point of politics.
The Panthers, of course, were given little leeway to work out their strategy in peace. Tragically, given their political approach, they could not protect their own cadres from the vicious onslaught of the attack by the state through the police and the courts. Virtually the entire Panther leadership has either been assassinated by the police (Fred Hampton and Bobby Hutton), put on trial or in jail for blatantly ludicrous charges (David Hillard, Panther Chief of Staff, was arrested for allegedly threatening Nixon’s life in a speech), or forced into exile.
Not only are Panthers subjected to such violence but the entire black community is itself constantly under attack. The Panthers have been unable to carry out their mammoth programme for arming the entire community to protect itself from the overwhelming military strength of the surrounding social structure. Furthermore, the Panthers, no more than any other group can wage sustained urban guerilla warfare in the context of American society. Even though sniping attacks (unrelated to the Panthers) against police have dramatically increased in the last few years, they do not constitute a threat to police domination and provide no way out of the impasse.
The failure of the original community control approach and the subsequent gyrations have enormously weakened the Panthers’ support in the black community. At the same time inability to defend themselves from massive police repression and from legal action has opened them up to influences from white sources of influence and money. By providing these, the Communist party and circles around it have increased their political influence on the Panthers.
 
The Panthers and White Leftists
From its inception the Black Panther Party, in contrast to other black nationalist groups, had been clear of the need to relate to elements in the white community. But there had never been any clear conception of which section of the white community to ally with. Initial contact was with the Peace and Freedom Party – an organisation of left liberals and white radicals opposing the Vietnam war and favouring black liberation from a variety of views. Within the Peace and Freedom Party the Panthers ultimately aligned themselves with the fringe ‘Yippy’ elements around Jerry Rubin, whom they saw as the counterpart to the lumpens of the black community. Later the Panthers worked with certain sections of the white student movement, SDS. Here they vacillated between support for various Maoists, who saw reliance on the Third World revolutions as the key to social change, and the ‘Weatherman’ group, who additionally advocated the organisation of direct, here-and-now, terror as the solution to capitalism’s ills. Both tendencies shared a common hostility to the white working class because of its racism.
The sharpness of the state attack forced the Panthers to do a 180 degree turn in the summer of 1969 in a desperate search for support. They initiated a ‘National Conference for a United Front Against Fascism’ and called upon all anti-fascist forces to coalesce – Republicans, Democrats and radicals. The demand for independent politics in opposition to the established parties, once an important part of the Panthers’ programme, fell by the wayside. Willy Brown, a black Democratic Party politician, was a featured speaker at the conference, while Herbert Apetheker, a CP theoretician, gave the keynote address.
Since the 1969 conference relations between the CP and the Black Panther Party have blown hot and cold and have been recently inflamed by different political positions on the Angela Davis Case. The present open factional schism in the Black Panthers reveals the extent to which the CP influence is a subject of intense internal conflict. Cleaver’s faction has charged that the ‘revolutionist’ politics of the Communist Party have come to dominate the Black Panther approach.
 
Conclusions
Black Power was an assertion by black people of their need for self-identification, self-power and self-respect. One of the most appalling consequences of the black subjugation was partial acceptance by blacks themselves of the general mythology that black people are inferior and incapable of self-leadership. When black workers thought of their alleged incapacity to control their environment, they often attributed this condition to their race, rather than to their position as workers. The struggle for black liberation has stripped away many of these illusions. Accompanying this has been the growing awareness that the upper layers of the black population do not represent the interests of the black working class.
The Panthers played an important role in this whole process. They developed into the major force inside the black liberation movement because they were able to offer a partial solution to problems previous currents had been unable to deal with. In a context in which the upper layers of the black community had moved away from real struggle, the Panthers opted for a society controlled by ‘the people’. However, their programme, by retaining the geographical notions of the old nationalist current, rather than espousing a working class alternative, came to an impasse. The present disintegration is a reflection of this.
Yet black consciousness at a certain point now meshes with working class consciousness. Black workers have begun to move towards the centre of the struggle by forming caucuses and organising committees in industry.
Lower rates of pay for black labour, the higher incidence of unemployment and the barriers to getting skilled jobs, all ensure the need for such caucuses. Moreover, such discrimination is practised not only by the employers, but also through the connivance of trade union bureaucrats, and racism is still pervasive in the white working class. However, while the caucuses concentrate on the special needs of black workers, they have increasingly participated in, and in some cases led, general working class struggles. White workers are forced to recognise the new self-confidence and collective power of the blacks. If white workers want to fignt tne bosses successfully, they have to come to terms with the newly organised and no longer docile black section of the class – and support the struggle for their particular demands.
Even where separate caucuses do not need to exist – where blacks are a clear majority of the work force and whites already accept their leadership – the notions of black power still have an impact in terms of heightened militancy. Such was the meaning of the experience of the 1970 New York postal strike.
The Black Panther Party was an important step forward, and it is perhaps understandable that it did not have a working class orientation at the outset; the American workers were not in rapid social motion. In the last period, however, the situation has begun to change. Not that the working class is on the brink of social power. It does not yet even recognise the need for political independence from the bourgeois parties. But its economic struggles have intensified dramatically. The permanent landscape of America now is one of escalating inflation, which threatens wage levels, and growing unemployment. Wild-cats, official strikes and demonstrations are now a daily part of the dramatically accelerating rhythm of class struggle. As the working class begins to move, organisations and programmes that do not recognise the centrality of proletarian struggle are increasingly rendered impotent or retrogressive.
 

n No Answer to Racism










The following article was first published in  Proletarian Revolution No. 50 (Fall 1995).

Farrakhan No Answer to Racism
The “Million Man March” led by Minister Louis Farrakhan, head of the Nation of Islam (NOI), was one of the most massive events ever held in Washington. The mainstream bourgeois media as well as the Black press described the October 16 rally as “historic” and “inspiring.” And there is no doubt that the sense of Black pride, solidarity and raised hopes among the participants was a profoundly moving experience. Revolutionaries, however, are careful to distinguish the aspirations of the masses from the aims of the leaders. 
It was no accident that the racist white capitalist politicians “liked the message” of the march and endorsed its goals, even though they decried the messenger. The ruling class liked the march because it was a diversion of the struggle for Black liberation and a safety valve for the justified and explosive anger of the ghetto masses.

Revolutionaries, on the other hand, opposed the message and goals of the march. Despite the feelings of solidarity, this march was built as a barrier to Black pride and Black struggle against the system.

The NOI proclaimed October 16 as a “Holy Day,” a “Day of Atonement.” Black men were to come together to apologize for purported past sins, including sloth, crime and drugs, “abuse of our women” and the failure to assume responsibility “as heads of our households.” Removing these ills from the Black community, it was claimed, would be a major blow against white supremacy. The march also stressed voter registration and Black “self-help” to build up independent businesses. Although the Gingriches were condemned and white racism attacked, the march and speakers stressed that it was “an internal thing,” an attempt by Black America to straighten up and fly right.

There were many good reasons for masses of Black people to march on Washington. Blacks are desperately looking for a way to fight deepening racist attacks, increasing economic devastation and the social horrors wreaked on their communities across the country. Before the march, the reaction to the O.J. Simpson verdict showed that only a minority of whites understand what Blacks overwhelmingly know: that the cops and courts are dedicated to injustice against them. 

Undoubtedly many came to Washington hoping to find a way to get united action against the orchestrated scapegoating of Blacks by the capitalist state and media. The most militant among them were disappointed, and rightly so. Far more, however, were genuinely inspired by the message of Farrakhan and the other speakers; united, they wanted to go back home committed to uplifting Black America.

If any Black leader but Farrakhan had put down “white bashing,” called for reconciliation with the “great” American government and stressed self-help the way he did in Washington, he would have been dismissed as a Clarence Thomas. But Farrakhan could get away with it because of his history of anti-white separatist rhetoric. But even he could only deliver his message of accommodation by associating it with Black pride, which accompanies Black anger over racism.

Surveys at the march show that participants came mostly from the middle strata and the upper reaches of the working class. Farrakhan’s mixed message had a particular appeal to this audience, but calls for self-organization and self-pride resonate among many poorer Black workers as well.

The tragedy is that once again hopes for self-uplifting are doomed. Not because the struggle for liberation is hopeless, and not because Blacks are powerless. In reality, Blacks have tremendous power, but the only way to obtain liberation is to use that power against the racist system. Black men are victimized by capitalist society and then vilified as an underclass of criminals and drug addicts. “Atonement” is no answer to the stark facts of raging unemployment, low-wage jobs and racist discrimination which keep Black men down.

The message of the march is even worse: it pumped up the reactionary ideology that today is fueling the right-wing attacks. The endorsement of traditional male/female roles is an acceptance of the sexist “family values” rhetoric of the racist religious right as well as the mainstream bourgeoisie. As the capitalist economic crisis destroys the family and society, the ruling class blames single Black mothers and Black “attitude,” criminality and culture. While workers and oppressed people yearn for stability, safety and a decent living standard, these sentiments are manipulated by the rulers to take the heat off the system and cast the blame on the victims. The march agenda fell right into line.

Despite rhetoric about fighting racist politics, the march avoided any concrete demands. It stressed voting registration, the prime diversion pushed by the bourgeoisie on all workers and oppressed. History proves that what was won on the streets in ghetto rebellions is being lost in the voting booths. A march whose goals were backed by enemies of the Black struggle like Clinton, Dole, Colin Powell, Chicago’s Mayor Daley, Philadelphia’s Mayor Rendell  and the Anti-Defamation League was itself part of the problem. 

Farrakhan succeeded in getting virtually all the key Black political figures to acknowledge his growing power among Blacks. The march signed on Rev. Benjamin Chavis, recently ousted head of the NAACP, social-democratic professor Cornel West, Washington mayor Marion Barry, civil rights heroine Rosa Parks and other notables. The Revs. Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton and Joseph Lowery (head of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference), fought off endorsing the affair for as long as they could but finally enlisted.

Why Farrakhan Flourishes
Much of Farrakhan’s current success derives from the gaping vacuum left in the Black leadership after the abject failures of integrationism and its advocates. Integrationist leaders for whom the NOI was previously anathema had to endorse a march whose men-only format had Farrakhan’s ideological stamp all over it—in order not to appear to stand against Black unity. 

There are several reasons why Farrakhan in particular has been able to capitalize on the current situation.

1. Farrakhan’s denunciation of racist American society, “this modern-day Babylon,” rings true, especially in comparison to the mealy-mouthed utterances of other Black leaders and politicians. He appears as a militant and angry outsider, a proud Black man who doesn’t play the game. 

2. The rising chorus of attacks on him by powerful white forces seems to confirm that he is an authentic champion of the victimized Black people. The attacks on him and the NOI mount along with the attacks against the whole race. Many Blacks, even those who fundamentally disagree with the NOI, solidarize with him as a target of white racists. 

3. U.S. capitalism sharply defines itself by race, in order to hide its fundamental class division. Farrakhan’s “nationalist” separatism not only seems to throw down the gauntlet in the face of white-dominated society, it also calls for unity of all Blacks against the surrounding enemy. Even among those who know that Blacks are not a nation, Farrakhan’s group-identity message strikes responsive and fervent chords in seeming to answer the serious need for Black self-defense.

4. Black shopkeepers, always far more marginal than their white counterparts, feel even more devastated and isolated in an economy that is especially crisis-ridden for Blacks. Their angry separatist yearnings cover a desperate hope for an accommodation with their white counterparts that will allow them their own space within the system. And like petty-bourgeois whites, they too have veered in increasing numbers toward the radical-sounding right—a right of a different color. They too have been prone to see the barriers to their aspirations not in bourgeois society but in other groups—Jews, Koreans, Latinos or immigrants in general. This builds Farrakhan’s petty-bourgeois base.

5. Farrakhan’s stress on self-help emphasizes business achievement and a puritan ethic; it can benefit only a small petty-bourgeois layer and has little practical meaning for the working-class masses. However, the message that Blacks will have to rise by their own efforts in a hostile world rings true. Blacks increasingly see that all the mainstream white-dominated institutions are hostile to Black advancement. Farrakhan appeals to those who have given up hope in society’s approved channels but not their aspirations to rise.

6. The capitalist attack on the government and foundation-backed “safety net” programs that were created in response to the ghetto revolts has already had an enormously destructive impact on the lives of impoverished Blacks. It has also undermined a whole strata of “povertycrats,” and the living standards and jobs of many other middle-class professionals are also threatened. Since the threat to affirmative action programs appears to come from other groups, many Blacks have come to understand the world as one of rival ethnicities. Thus integrationism has eroded among the educated middle strata, and the separatist outlook has grown. Farrakhan’s traditional petty-bourgeois base has expanded to include such middle-class elements. 

7. While the vast majority of U.S. Blacks are working-class, class identification between Black and white workers is low. The chief reason is that the unions rarely fight for the needs of their members, Black, Latino or white—certainly not for the numerous Black workers and unemployed outside their organizations. The blocking of class identity facilitates the rise of petty-bourgeois leaders among the oppressed.

8. So far only a tiny minority of Black workers and students have been exposed to authentic revolutionary Marxism, the real alternative to both integrationism and separatism. The middle-class left has tailed either pro-capitalist integrationism or pro-capitalist nationalism and avoided fighting for an openly revolutionary solution.

What Is Black Nationalism?

We sometimes put “Black nationalism” in quotes precisely because nationalism without a territorial base isn’t really nationalism. As well, Blacks are subjugated in the U.S. but not as a separate nation.

Elijah Muhammad, founder of the NOI, generally cast his expectations for the future of the “Lost-Found Black Nation” in vague theological terms. The NOI continues to call for a separate national state, as it must if it is to maintain its uncompromising stance of rejecting white society. However, Louis Farrakhan also speaks in “practical” terms. In his book Back Where We Belong, published in 1989, he states:

If you say we must return to Africa, what nation in Africa is willing to receive 40 million of us? ... . Let us be reasonable ... . America is not willing to give us eight or ten states, or even one state. Let’s be reasonable.

In the years before and after the American Revolutionary War, there existed movements among the African slaves for a return to Africa. In later years the call for an American Black homeland in Africa, Haiti, Central America, the Southern Black Belt or elsewhere struck responsive feelings among many Blacks—but not because they actually expected or wanted a territorial haven. Such ideologies flourished after serious setbacks in the struggles for equality in the U.S. At those times, as now, for the masses of plebeian Blacks “Black Nationalism” meant militant rejection of white alliances and lying promises, plus a call for Black unity to repel the siege.

In effect, the Black nationalist leaders’ underlying aim is not to forge a separate Black nation but an internal colony, a subordinated nation (which does not now exist). Consciously or not, the separatist wing of the petty bourgeoisie aims to become a junior partner comprador class exploiting Black labor for the dominant American imperialist ruling class.

Blacks in the U.S. are caught in a contradiction which, barring genocide, will last as long as capitalism exists. They are constantly driven to try to realize the system’s promise of full participation, while they are always rejected in the end. This torturous contradiction created Farrakhan; he cannot resolve it and is doomed to reflect it.

Because Farrakhan wants to function as a broker between the ruling class and the masses of angry Blacks, he must champion mass sentiment to a degree. At present he has been able to get away with an openly conservative program because of the vacuum of leadership and struggle; masses are momentarily responsive to his strong call for unity and self-assertion and do not yet demand a radical content. 

Even under these circumstances, Farrakhan and his followers could come under violent attack or repression by the capitalist state. It would then be necessary for revolutionary workers to defend him—for the real intended target would be the Black masses. In the future, Farrakhan may be forced to raise militant demands and call meaningful actions, in order to hold leadership when mass struggles break out. In that case revolutionaries would join in common action, always warning against Farrakhan’s treacherous pro-capitalist leadership. This is the method of the united front.

Dreams and Nightmares

The alternative strategy among Black leaders has been integrationism, previously called assimilationism. This must not be confused with Marxist internationalism and interracialism. Marxists seek working-class unity across race and national lines. Our strategy always champions the rights of oppressed nations, peoples and races—to prove that capitalism is the enemy and that the revolutionary struggle of the whole working class is the solution. In sharp contrast, integrationist leaders delude the Black masses that America can become a colorblind society without the overthrow of capitalism. 

Worthwhile achievements like the removal of legal segregation were accomplished through determined struggles, but U.S. capitalism requires that society still depends on racial oppression. The real gains made by the Black struggle in the 1960’s and the early 1970’s came from the ghetto rebellions that swept urban America and caused the capitalists to act out of genuine fear. The revolts were sparked largely by unorganized poor workers who paid no attention to the efforts of the integrationist Martin Luther King or the NAACP to restrain them. The only nationally prominent leaders with real authority were Malcolm X and a few Black Power figures whose politics had a revolutionary cast. 

The ghetto rioters wanted jobs, an end to police brutality and other concrete changes. They did not share the illusions about whites and Blacks walking hand in hand into the future. Integrationism was a vague but useful false consciousness under which the ruling class and the new Black middle-class layer, created in response to the mass struggle, could cement their hold. The inherently racist ruling class accepted dappling their governmental facade with some Black faces. 

A big campaign effort for Black voting registration took place under the aegis of Jesse Jackson, starting in the late 1980’s. Throughout the 1970’s Black progress had been undermined by the deepening capitalist crisis. The Reagan years saw a turn to a more frontal assault. Despite the election of more Black politicians, things got worse for Black people. And Black voting declined.

Jackson’s presidential crusades in 1984 and 1988 were designed to reinvigorate the Black vote, prop up the declining Democratic Party—and promote Jackson as the hegemonic leader of Blacks. Even though he was a protege of King, Jackson’s campaigns were notable for their barely hidden subordination of integrationism in favor of interest-group “Rainbow” politics in which Blacks would have substantial influence and peacefully coexist with all others. 

Jackson succeeded in gaining Black leadership for a time. Hoping against hope, more Blacks voted again. But the reality of U.S. capitalism intruded. Jackson had to humble himself before the powerful in the Democratic Party. His Rainbow Coalition served as a cover for the Black and white liberal politicians who themselves served as front men for the capitalist attack on the oppressed and exploited in America. Farrakhan, who in the past had collaborated with Jackson and PUSH and had endorsed his campaign in 1984, began to inherit sizable chunks of Jackson’s base.  

Anger ... and Inaction

Booker T. Washington, the acknowledged forerunner of Marcus Garvey and the NOI separatists, could plead with the ruling class by falsely claiming that Black slaves had dutifully assisted their masters in the Civil War and therefore should be treated well. But Farrakhan, to carry out his program for a separate Black economy, must express the rage and rejection of white domination felt by the masses in order to win their support and use it to compel concessions.

Farrakhan both expresses his followers’ rage and demands their social obedience. Hence his militant rhetoric and demonstrations of power, on the one hand—and his avoidance of any anti-government or even anti-white acts, on the other. Farrakhan’s anti-Semitism is also in part a shopworn maneuver to make him seem hostile to the white ruling class; in reality scapegoating Jews lets the ruling class as a whole off the hook. (For background on the Black/Jewish confrontation, see articles in PR 22 and 40.)

Unlike Washington, Farrakhan cannot now cajole the white bourgeoisie. Not only is today’s monopoly economy far more interpenetrated with Black business, but Blacks are now predominantly working-class and live in the heart of the urban centers; while driven back, their threat of social “disobedience” has by no means been smashed. There is no defeat of historic proportions as with the betrayal of Blacks by the populists in the 1890’s. Farrakhan’s major card for winning capitalist support is this threat of rebellion and revolution. Without it the ruling class would ignore him. 

In Back Where We Belong, arguing that the capitalists should back his aims, Farrakhan stated:


I say to you, it is in America’s best interest to permit us to do this. For right now blacks are becoming increasingly disenchanted, and we are a social tinderbox. And if black people rise up in an evil manner, we could foment revolution inside this country ... .

The danger for Farrakhan too is that the Black masses might carry out the threat; then his program would be smashed. True to his outlook, Farrakhan joined with Black politicians in calling for law and order in Los Angeles in the wake of the 1992 riots. The threat of rebellion is a two-edged sword for him, and Farrakhan knows it. 

For all its blistering anti-white rhetoric and the menace implied by its Fruit of Islam guards, the NOI remains inert in response to brutal physical attacks on Black communities. The NOI is no different in this respect today than in the days of the martyred Malcolm X, who said:

It could be heard increasingly in the Negro communities: “Those Muslims talk tough but they never do anything unless somebody bothers Muslims.”

Black “nationalism” never fundamentally challenged capitalist society. It sought to achieve a parallel (if far smaller) Black economy internally. Leaders like Garvey and Elijah Muhammad never sunk roots in Africa, but they did create and nurture Black-owned businesses in the U.S.

The Nation’s Business

The NOI today follows in their footsteps. While most of its capital comes from members and friends, some comes from investment by Black businessmen. The NOI also has contracts with several big-city governments to police housing projects. Business Week touted Farrakhan’s entrepreneurship, adding that, “If necessary, the Nation says, it will turn to banks for funding.” (March 13, 1995.) Even if the banks in question are Black-owned, they are financially interpenetrated with the top financial and industrial corporations and the U.S. government, all dominated by white capitalists. 

The firms started by Garvey and Elijah Muhammad inevitably meshed with the economic fabric of monopoly capitalism, if they lasted at all. That will be the fate of most of NOI’s projected businesses: a surface separateness for a marginal and actually dependent economy. Under continuing economic discrimination, Black business takes in approximately 1 percent of the national income. It exploits a tiny fraction of the Black working class; white capitalists directly carry out super-exploitation without a significant Black intermediary. To the extent that Black-owned businesses and franchises become big, they tend not only to merge into the larger economy but also to broaden their hiring policies. 

The claim that the nationalist petty-bourgeoisie will hire more Black labor attracts support among Black workers, especially the unemployed. But given the economic decay, only a minuscule number can expect to be hired. And the capitalist drive for cheaper labor means that other subjugated minorities are forced to sell their labor power at super-exploited levels, thereby pressuring down wages in the relatively marginal Black businesses even further.    

Women Stay Back
Black nationalism is a pro-capitalist ideology that mimics in many ways the values of the dominant capitalist culture. The Nation of Islam shares the paternalism that is a vital part of bourgeois culture and its other religions. In some ways it outdoes the reactionary white campaign for the restoration of “traditional family values”; it even advocates that women be veiled, treating them as male property. 

Capitalism promotes the sanctity of the traditional bourgeois patriarchal family as a counter to class consciousness. The “protected” woman is supposedly shielded from the rigors of the workplace, the big questions of the world and the struggles in it; as the isolated and parochialized homebody, she serves to restrain class struggle by her spouse, and to transmit conservative ideology to the children. The man is supposed to feel big because he can control “his” woman, even though he and she are both controlled by the system.

A march that goes to Washington with the same message as the white right wing is no threat to the racists. It says to the forces it claims to oppose that it is really with them. It asks in effect, “Why attack us? We are really your allies.” Of course, rather than mollifying the reactionaries, this only tells them they have nothing to fear in continuing their attacks.

In emerging as the premier “race leader” at the march, Farrakhan tempered his separatism, his anti-Semitism and his doctrines on women. But his anti-woman message remained clear. Women were virtually excluded, and “atonement” to the noble, dependent females remained the theme. Women were still told to step aside and let the men take their “rightful place”: up front and in control. To cover for having to ally with Farrakhan in the face of his progressive friends, Jesse Jackson did his best to provide a liberal rationale for the obviously sexist format. Jessica Moore reports in the Daily Challenge (Oct. 2) that in a Harlem speech he spoke of “marching with a moral code centered around ‘no racism, no anti-Semitism, no anti-Arabism, no Asian bashing, no homophobia, no sexism ...’ ”  And no women.

Gay-bashing is a natural companion to sexism. At a preparatory rally in Washington in August, Rev. George Stalling gave the authentic message behind the march in an address broadcast by National Public Radio. He said: 

You know, some folks say if Minister Farrakhan hadn’t called [the march] ... we’d gladly join in. What do you want? Some Milquetoast, some sissy faggot, to lead you to the promised land?

He got thunderous applause. Farrakhan’s stalwarts give one message to the cadres of NOI and their periphery—and another line that carefully avoids inflammatory statements to the broader public. The rhetoric on women, gays, Jews and whites varies, depending on audience and circumstance. Since speaking truth to the Black masses is not a high priority for these elitists, consistency is no virtue for them either.

In reality, it is the contradictions of crisis-ridden capitalism itself—not gays, not Black women, not Black men, not godlessness—that are tearing apart the bourgeois family structure. Black men get less pay for more work, if they can get jobs at all. Black women have always been forced into the workplace to survive—at lower wages for comparable work than men. Black men and women are both underpaid compared to the white male standard, which itself is falling. Black unemployment, poverty and the high death rate of young Black men due to crime, drugs and disease is what has made it so hard to maintain Black marriages. 

Thus, for all its obvious male chauvinism, Farrakhan’s message also disparages Black men. In saying that it is not primarily the capitalist system but Black men who are responsible for the crisis between Black men and women, Farrakhan’s ideology exacerbates the crisis.

That Farrakhan puts down Black women and men should be no surprise. Beneath all the rhetoric about self-help is his belief that the Black masses’ condition is basically their own fault. If the voter registration campaign does not gain the numbers the NOI has proclaimed, it will blame the supposed indolence of the Black masses rather than their awareness that the vote means little in their lives.

Disdaining uncontrolled mass action, Farrakhan is obliged to register his demand for a piece of the pie through elections, the same road to nowhere pursued by the integrationists and the Rainbow chasers before him. All these misleaders accept the idea that Blacks must seek minimal redress and reforms within the limits of capitalism. And whatever the initial radical rhetoric, given their fundamental loyalty to the capitalist system, relying on politicians inevitably means detouring the masses into electoral passivity. 

The Electoral Deathtrap

It is no accident that Farrakhan made yet another voter registration drive a centerpiece of the march. Donald Muhammad of The Final Call, the NOI’s newspaper, quotes him as saying:

We believe that one million Black men sober, disciplined and organized, each one registered to vote with many more millions back in the various cities of America in support of us, we believe we can become a powerful voting bloc for the upcoming presidential elections, and, therefore, it is our desire to formulate a Black agenda which every presidential hopeful will have to speak to before he can get our vote. (Your Black Books Guide, Aug. 1995.)

But the capitalist candidates all have their own Black agenda: racism, joblessness, austerity. Playing the system soberly, by its rules, will not work, especially not now.


At the outset of his mobilization for the march, Farrakhan stressed the need for Blacks to pull out of the Democratic Party because it takes them for granted, and register as independents to maximize their bargaining power. Having brought major political leaders like Jackson into line, he has toned down the idea of withdrawing from the Democrats.

Farrakhan always emphasizes his loyalty to the doctrines of Elijah Muhammad. He keeps the faith in that he too denounces confrontational actions by Blacks. That applies above all to his own march (an action Muhammad could never have taken): he has emphasized how controlled and respectable it would be. When he called on Black non-marchers not to work on October 16, he urged them to stay home and pray.

His electoral line and political coalition-building amount to a clear departure from his mentor’s abstentionist views. Given the material conditions in which his organization and the Black community now find themselves, he has no choice but to orient to the state and therefore to electoralism. The state has funded the “safety net.” The state enforces affirmative action. Only the state could mobilize the capital which Farrakhan needs to carry out his Black capitalist program. The state today gives him a few contract morsels to whet his appetite for more. 

Marx pointed out that the working class can only fit itself for power through class struggle. Many of  the concerns of the march—“Black on Black” crime, drugs, etc.—can be overcome only through mass action against the racist capitalist state, not by passively voting for it.
 
Race and Revolution

Under the surface the American masses are boiling angry and desperately frustrated. Isolated riots and strike actions flare up—but they do not become widespread because the participants and their counterparts elsewhere do not see in them a viable strategy against the one-sided class and race war waged against them. Yet a titanic explosion is inevitable. 

In this context, the right wing is radicalizing, in an attempt to reach the masses with their fraudulent message. Attuned to the deep rumblings under the surface, they are arming themselves politically and militarily for the coming struggles. In contrast, the remains of the middle-class left and the present leadership of the oppressed can only put forward, once again, the powderpuff strategy of electoralism: independent political action, Rainbow blocs, reformist labor parties. 
Instead, what is vitally needed is a communist revolutionary party whose program reflects the actual needs and interests of the proletariat—especially of Black workers, the potentially most volatile and a very powerful section of the proletariat. Such a party, composed primarily of advanced workers, would mobilize for mass action instead of the electoral crapshoot. A revolutionary party would run in elections only to better expose the capitalist system, not to support it.

The world capitalist crisis has already caused the collapse of Stalinism and the pulverization of the middle classes. With these barriers shattered, the objective possibilities for the re-creation of authentic proletarian communist parties are vastly improved. In the U.S., given their history and strategic emplacement in today’s urban industrial economy, Blacks will play a leading role in the return of class struggle and therefore in the building of a revolutionary party, way out of proportion to their numbers in the general population. The absence of such an alternative at this moment allows Farrakhan to emerge as the champion of Black unity and self-assertion, although his political program is a deadly trap. 
Past and present conditions have led Blacks to a profound distrust of whites. Much of the Black experience with so-called Marxists, Black as well as white, has also led to suspicion of manipulation and hidden agendas. Such distrust can only be overcome by proven and sustained practice, not simply promises. 

Revolutionary policy must include support for organized mass self-defense at all times. Winning white workers to the fight against racism is both possible and necessary if capitalism in this country is to be overthrown. But when Blacks face police violence and other thug attacks, they have every reason to organize their own self-defense. As well, authentic Trotskyists in the U.S. have always advanced the right of Black self-organization. At a time when the Black struggle is advancing, revolutionaries advocate a mass Black organization within which they can campaign openly for revolutionary proletarian leadership. These are important tactics, both for defending the genuine need for Black unity and for demonstrating the necessity of a revolutionary class strategy.

The revolutionary party always fights for effective struggle against racism and capitalism, to demonstrate that white workers share Black workers’ basic interests. That is why the LRP from our inception has advocated a general strike in this country. That is the way the working class can achieve a genuine class identity and the racist-inspired barriers of the past can begin to be broken down.

For example, when we fight for the general strike, a class-wide action, we aim to politically arm such actions with demands like jobs for all, an escalating scale of wages and a sliding scale of hours—to divide up the necessary work among all. We demand the building of public works to provide vital services and employment. We demand an end to racist attacks and attacks on immigrants.

Such a program meets the immediate interests of Black workers. Capitalism has already proved that only full employment, not affirmative action programs and quotas which accept the present (and declining) level of employment, can guarantee Blacks jobs. Such demands are in fact in the interest of all workers, because all are now under the threat of peon wages and massive unemployment. The socialist program both promotes class unity and fights against racism at the same time.

Today the fighters for such a program are few but are beginning once again to increase. In the U.S., small but significant new layers of young workers are coming to revolutionary consciousness. Mostly, but not entirely, Black and Latino, they are no fans of Farrakhan. However, many are confused by his appeal. Believing in an interracial world, they are confused by the evident need for Blacks to organize their own defense in a racist society; how can these tenets both be true? Only authentic Marxism can answer such questions and point the way forward to what we most need, a revolutionary, internationalist and interracialist vanguard party.

etto Fighters









“Warsaw Ghetto Fighters” was originally published in Socialist Voice No. 19 (Summer 1983). It was re-published in Proletarian Revolution No. 68 (Summer/Fall 2003) with an introduction titled “On the Sixtieth Anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.” (Socialist Voice was the predecessor of Proletarian Revolution.)

On the Sixtieth Anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising

Summer/Fall 2003
Lenin described the history of each culture as having two component parts, the democratic culture of the toiling masses and the elitist culture of the ruling classes. In graphic strokes, a well-documented record of monumental events—often bloody—testifies to the presence of these two entwined opposites embedded within the history of the Jewish people.
For centuries under feudalism, Jews were a pariah caste in Europe. The craftsmen and other usually impoverished laborers served their exploiters, the upper class—the Rothschilds and their ilk. In turn, these “court Jews” served their masters, the Christian lords, as their merchants and usurers. When scapegoats were necessary, it was the Jewish masses who were persecuted and did the suffering, far more often than the treacherous traders and bankers. 
Of course, the wealthy merchants had their Jewish pawns, including the clerics. The rabbis served as the ideological prison guards for the craftsmen, chaining them to their exploiters by preaching hatred of the “enemy,” the gentiles—meaning in reality their fellow urban toilers and serfs who were Christian, not the Christian lords. When mind-rotting religious superstition failed to quash rebellions against the upper classes, the armed lackeys of the lords and their deluded anti-Semitic followers invaded the ghettoes to kill, rape and repress—inspired by their own priests and their own godly drivel. In Eastern Europe, these deadly rampages were known as “pogroms” and their gentile perpetrators were often known as “the cossacks.”
In Western Europe, the advent of capitalism, the bourgeois democratic revolution and the “age of reason” broke down much of the old caste barriers, along with their prejudices and religious furies. At the end of the 19th century, however,with the development of imperialist and counterrevolutionary capitalism, the old anti-Jewish crap began to return with a vengeance, in far more devastating forms.
Soon Nazism, decadent capitalism’s last resort, spawned the genocidal massacre of millions of working-class and middle-class Jews across Europe, in addition to untold numbers of other human beings.
Communist revolutionaries insist upon the absolutely critical need for leadership, proletarian leadership. This is not because leadership is inherently good; it is merely inherently necessary. The working class must have its own vanguard party if it is to successfully make the socialist revolution. But the ruling class also depends upon having its leadership accepted. The highly organized Jewish communities were dominated by leaderships which served the upper classes and sought to collaborate with the Nazi masters. Their Jewish police minions, right-wing pro-Nazi Zionist thugs, served as the fist within the ghettoes by repressing potential anti-Nazi mass revolts. Once again, they fulfilled their contemptible duty of serving their Jewish and gentile rulers by trying to ensure the subordination of the oppressed and exploited workers and craftsmen.
Our 1983 Article
To their everlasting glory, the socialist workers of the Warsaw Ghetto rose up to fight the Nazis in spite of the Jewish bourgeoisie and its pro-fascist thugs, and in spite of the absence of aid by the imperialist “democratic” West or the Stalinists in Moscow. We recount the story of this doomed but profoundly heroic revolt in an all-too compressed summary below. This account originally appeared in this magazine twenty years ago, commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the event. We add only a few comments now to place the account in context. 
Overwhelmingly, the traumatized survivors of the Holocaust were not Zionists. Unable to stay in countries still swimming in the blood of their families, they found the doors to the victorious “democratic” imperialist nations shut in their faces. With the connivance of the British imperialists, they were shoveled into Palestine. These Jews were thrown into a conflict designed to repress the rebellious
anti-colonial Arab population.
In 1948, Israel was founded on stolen Arab land—with the support of Washington, London and Moscow—in a war of ethnic cleansing. Once again, the interests of the Jewish masses were diverted into the service of the Jewish upper classes. Once again, the Jewish upper classes and their thugs serve not only their own interests but 
the interests of their dominant allies and masters, the lords of Western imperialism, especially those in Washington.
There are certainly vast differences between the class relationships of the past and those of today with respect to Jews and with the creation of Israel. One important role that has been transformed is that the armed fist of murderous repression is no longer solely that of the gentiles. The Israeli colonial-settlers now conduct their own pogroms against other Semites, the Palestinian Arabs, and are now cossacks in the service of the imperialist lords and masters: “Guardians of Western Civilization.”
Ronald Reagan’s invasion of Lebanon in 1983 in defense of both U.S. imperialist interests and those of its Israeli junior partner, referred to in the reprinted article, has now been trumped by his successor’s bloody invasion of Iraq, designed to achieve the same purpose more successfully. The murderous anti-Palestinian role played by the Zionist leader Menachem Begin, the descendent of the pro-Nazi Jewish police force in Europe, is now played by the even more bloody-handed monster, Ariel Sharon. 
Ghetto Revolt and Intifada
The role of the heroic Jewish workers who led the Warsaw Ghetto Revolt is now largely played by the Palestinian workers, artisans and small farmers who are the backbone of the intifada, the daily battle of the Arab masses against the imperialist colonial-settler pogromists.
The Arab masses have their own traitors and false leaders, secular in the form of Arafat and Abbas, religious obscurantist in the form of Hamas and its kind. Arabs, like Jews and all other peoples, have a mass democratic class component and an elitist and treacherous upper class component. We note with elation the reports that a rising number of Palestinians are now searching for Marxist and revolutionary answers. 
Indeed, Marxist internationalism is the only hope for their survival; it is the same consciousness that motivated so many of the Warsaw ghetto workers, whose memory is so befouled by Israel today. 
We are also moved by the re-emergence in occupied Palestine—Israel—of a very small but growing number of young Jewish workers who reflect the spirit of the Warsaw Jewish working-class revolt. We are now engaged in discussion with these comrades, who are so seriously trying to find their way to engage in the Arab struggle for liberation. They are firm in the knowledge that it can only succeed if it becomes
a working class-led struggle for a Palestinian workers’ state, part of a federation of Middle Eastern socialist states. Jewish workers can attain freedom, economic well-being and all their independent cultural aspirations in such a workers’ state.  They can never be free living on stolen land in a sea of hostility.
They know that the bourgeois Zionists have led the Jewish masses into a disaster in Palestine, an eternal war that means not only the continual murder of fellow Arab workers, but in the long run, a death trap for the Jewish workers. Sooner or later, if the Palestinian socialist revolution does not triumph, once again the Jewish masses will be faced with an ultimate betrayal by their own treacherous secular leaders and rabbis. We certainly may add their Western imperialist lords and masters, as well as their new “allies,” the Christian fundamentalists, who have always been such good friends to the Jewish pariahs they treated so well throughout history.

Warsaw Ghetto Fighters 
Summer 1983
This is the fortieth anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising which began on April 19, 1943. The courageous Jewish fighters, armed with only Molotov cocktails and a puny assortment of guns, took on the armored might of Nazi legions and held on for months before being overwhelmed. The “anti-fascist” imperialist powers, Great Britain, the Soviet Union and, above all, the United States, did nothing. Now they do too much. 
Today, hired word-merchants dust off the requisite phrases lauding the Warsaw Ghetto martyrs. And the world’s statesmen mouth them. When those oppressed Jews fought tanks and artillery with their hands to stay alive and keep their families out of the ovens, they were a damned nuisance. Now they are damned by great praise. 
Did you notice how many official Expressions of Sympathy the Palestinians in Lebanon received from the capitals of the world after they were crushed by the Israeli blitzkrieg? Take heart that we live in a world where even the mightiest of imperialists are still capable of shedding a tear for the unfortunate and oppressed—so long as 
they are, safely, the victims and in no danger of becoming the victors. 
Praise today from the Reagans and the Begins seeks to replace the real heroism of the ghetto masses with cardboard images to suit contemporary national chauvinist(Zionist) needs. The true heroism of the stalwart Jewish fighters of Warsaw came not from the fact that Jews as a whole people were “chosen” or especially ennobled by their centuries of oppression. In the ghetto there were Jews who were
capitalists and made profits by trafficking with their Nazi overlords, just as their fellow capitalists from other occupied sections of Europe did. The Jewish capitalists ran the ghetto council (Judenrat), which carried on administrative tasks for the Germans while ghetto dwellers were being shipped out to the camps. There were the Jewish police who guarded the ghetto for their Nazi masters. Not by accident many
of these police were Revisionists, the Jewish fascist progenitors of the Begin crew of today. Jews like every other people are divided into classes, classes which in crisis behave very differently from each other. That is why the bourgeoisie collaborated and that is why it was the working class which fought. But given their particular oppression as Jews, these workers fought with particular strength. 
It was the Jewish workers who formed out of their own ranks the Jewish Fighting  Organization (JFO) which conducted the bitter, doomed war against the Nazis. It was house to house combat—and when the houses were burned down and blasted apart, rubble to rubble combat. And when the few who remained alive were forced from the rubble, they continued the war from the sewers and newly dug tunnels, until in July
they were finally annihilated. With them perished the hopes of the last of the 70,000 Jews who had been penned up in the ghetto. 
The JFO was overwhelmingly manned and led by workers, class-conscious and imbued with socialist ideals and principles. They fought fascism not on national grounds alone but out of the deep commitment to the struggle for a socialist world so long nurtured in the hearts of beleaguered Jewish workers in East Europe. These were the Jews who began their struggle by shooting Jewish capitalists and Jewish police
as they sought to unify themselves in the combat against Nazism. These were the warriors who could have escaped through the sewers to the safety offered them by their allies in the underground Polish workers’ movement. Instead, they chose to stay to fight and die with their families, their people and their class. 
However, it would be a lie to leave it at that. Present in the leadership of the Jewish workers were other ideas in addition to socialist consciousness. And these ideas reflected, in part, the mixed consciousness of the Jewish masses. There were illusions in the Western imperialist allies, in the Stalinist Soviet Union, in Zionism and other forms of Jewish nationalism. Each of these viewpoints provided a barrier in the struggle; they helped delay it, they helped give a false sense of the possibility of rescue until it was too late, and more.
The Polish and Jewish workers’ movements had a rich history of political dialogue and polemic. They regarded political debate as a vital part of the class struggle.  This was not lost in the ghetto even under the Nazi heel prior to the “final solution.” Dozens of left political tendencies and publications flourished, and political life was intense—as questions of how to fight Nazism and how to 
win socialism were debated. Exchange, criticisms and polemics from abroad had always been encouraged as part of the vitality of a self-confident movement which, no matter its current state, acknowledged its internationalist heritage. 
We too make no apologies for seeking to iron out in debate questions of principle, strategy and tactics based upon past gains and past experience. In fact we learned this, the Marxist form of politics, from precisely such progenitors as the ghetto fighters for socialism. We would do them less than honor if we were to join the ranks of hypocrites and bury their political and military accomplishments in false flattery. 
In not giving political support to the dominant political leaderships which carried out the ghetto struggle, we certainly do not wish to forget the small force present at the time to whom we do give our allegiance, the Trotskyists. We have at best incomplete knowledge of their work, but we do know that they fought and died beside
their working-class brothers and sisters with honor. We like they give military support and fight alongside our class even when we cannot agree with its current political leadership. 
It is not only in Poland that the new round of proletarian struggles are brewing. The whole world is on the eve. As our Trotskyist ancestors did in the Warsaw Ghetto we shall do now. The movement will have all its hesitancies and mistakes which will cost it in blood, but Bolsheviks shall fight alongside their class, always trying to point the way, confident that the mass struggle itself will teach the class its path to a communist world. This time the struggle of the Warsaw Ghetto—writ large—will not be defeated. Our class can and does learn from its history. 

Remember the Warsaw Ghetto! 
Forward to the Re-creation of the Fourth International!

Black Upsurge Meets Electoral Trap

Socialist Voice No. 19 (Summer 1983)
 Transcribed, Edited and Formatted by Damon Maxwell in 2009 for the Encyclopedia of Trotskyism On-Line.
Harold Washington’s election as mayor of Chicago in April, following his upset Democratic Party primary victory in February, is being hailed by both black and white activists as a magnificent step forward in the struggle for progress in the United States. The black congressman’s triumph in such a heavily segregated city did reflect a leap in black consciousness; at the same time it is significant testimony to the way that consciousness is being perverted and turned against the black masses.
The contradictory upsurge is occurring in the context of the simmering crisis of capitalism, which has had a profound impact on the way the bourgeoisie rules the country as a whole and specifically its second largest city. The collapse and fragmentation of the infamous Chicago political machine reflects not only schisms within the bourgeoisie but, alongside the black resurgence, an increasing polarization within the white working class.
Statistics measure part of the significance of the political shift. Black voting figures in Chicago as well as elsewhere have until recently been traditionally low and (as with Hispanic and working-class whiles) decreasing. In the 1980 Reagan-Carter presidential election, with 950,000 Chicago blacks eligible to vote, only 400,000 were registered and only about 30 percent of these actually voted. However, two and a half years later, 77 percent of blacks as well as whites who were registered voted in the primary, and Washington got over 80 percent of the black vote. In the interim, black leaders and leftist politicians had succeeded in getting over 150,000 additional blacks to register. Since Washington won the superheated primary with a bare 36.7 percent of the vote while the rest was split between two white machine candidates, incumbent mayor Jane Byrne and Richard Daley, son of Chicago’s long-time machine ruler, the black shift was decisive. Washington then got well over 90 percent in the election against Republican Bernard Epton.
Washington referred to his primary campaign as a “crusade,” and it certainly was much more than simply a winning electoral effort. The avalanche of blacks into the voting booths was touched off by Mayor Byrne. Blacks had backed Byrne when she split the once-monolithic machine in 1979. In office she stabbed them in the back: she ignored a popular black educator in favor of one of his subordinates as her candidate for the city’s school superintendency; she replaced blacks with whites on the board of education and the Chicago Housing Authority board; her police chief was the notoriously racist Richard Brzeczek. All this led to a campaign to boycott last summer’s ChicagoFest, part of Byrne’s program to stimulate commercial activity; then to the successful voter registration drive; and finally the elections. While the spark that lit the fire was Byrne’s conduct in office, the fuel came from far more profound causes reflecting the foundering of the U.S. social structure.
Washington’s Moderate Program
Washington himself jumped at the opportunity to underscore the significance of the massive black primary vote. It was, he said, blacks’ “coming into political maturity”:
We were slow to move from the protest movement into politics. We were lulled to sleep thinking that passing a few laws was enough. But we’ve got to be involved in the mainstream political activity. That’s what’s happening here in Chicago. And that’s the lesson that’s going out across the country.
Here Washington seizes on the fact that the gains blacks made in the 1960’s have been rapidly eroding (a fact, by the way, that liberals and reformists never warned of but was predicted repeatedly by Marxists) ; that is why he criticizes the ideas that protest or “passing a few laws” were enough. But no one should imagine that new and greater achievements are now possible. Actually Washington means the exact opposite. Politicians like Washington believe that the Democratic Party is the place for compromise. “Maturity” in his book means surrendering adolescent fantasies, such as eliminating racism and winning full employment, education for all, etc. It means getting smart – that is, becoming cynical. It means accepting the fact that the earlier ambitions were unreal and unachievable in the real world.
One of Washington’s aides said of the “crusade” that “It was like Harold was Martin Luther King all over again.” But whatever his actual accomplishments, Martin Luther King had a dream; Harold Washington says wake up and look at the world around you – only small changes are possible.
According to representative Gus Savage, Washington’s close friend, “White people may see him as some sort of Black Panther, but he’s actually a moderate.” He is indeed. Take his interview in the February Chicago magazine, when he was asked about Chicago’s notorious “invisible government – the business community, suburban executives.” He answered,
I’m meeting with them daily, in singles, pairs and groups. And they find out I don’t have horns. ... I wouldn’t say the business community to a man is anti-black. They want the status quo and, to a certain extent, so do I. I’m not talking about changing the whole make-up of the city of Chicago. ... I’m talking about trying to create a city in which business will be, shall we say, more relaxed about coming in. ...
Obviously a candidate who loved the banks and big corporations of Chicago – where their conservatism has never been veiled, they have always sided with the machine and always supported the white status quo – would not have much appeal among black workers. Nevertheless, Washington knows how capitalism works. The city could not survive without credit from the big banks and the trust of the giant companies. An ardent pro-Washington reformist, David Moberg, writing in the Chicago-based social-democratic paper In These Times, quoted Washington as saying, “We have to conduct ourselves in such a way that in the process of winning we do not make it impossible to govern.” Moberg points to the difficulty Washington would face as a result of “white flight or a capital strike against the city by banks and businesses.”
In fact Washington openly campaigned for a state income tax increase to bail Chicago out of its financial crisis. That is one reason why the little white primary support he got came mostly from the upper and middle-class Lakefront districts. Washington had said aloud what Daley and Byrne wouldn’t admit – that all three candidates stood for the financial program of the banks and the Republicans. If he could not get higher taxes from the state he urged that “we go on an austerity budget ...”. Austerity for the workers is now very popular among capitalists, and Washington’s little get-togethers had their effect. The president of the Greater State Street Council noted that Washington had “said many of the things the business community wanted to hear.”
Harold Washington’s dilemma is the same as that of any liberal or reformer who takes office at the head of a popular movement these days. And not just in the decaying cities of the U.S. For very similar reasons, the Nicaraguan Sandinistas try to keep capitalists in their government, plead their moderation internationally and work overtime to keep the masses in check and private property as inviolate as possible. Likewise Robert Mugabe seeks to placate the imperialist U.S., apartheid South Africa and white racist ex-ruler Ian Smith, at the expense of the Zimbabwean people. Salvador Allende played the same game in Chile in the early 1970’s, and lost.
The choice is clear. If capitalism is to be maintained, business must be allowed to squeeze out its profits and the banks their interest. When times are tough it is the working people who must be squeezed. Fewer workers will have to do the work once done by more, and they will receive less pay. Social services needed by working people will have to be drastically cut. And capitalists invariably demand harsher terms from reformist politicians than from others: the risks are greater, and therefore the returns must be greater or the sources of investment will dry up and go elsewhere. For capitalists are frightened of mass movements, especially during crisis-ridden times. They fear that the reformers cannot control their base and that the populist rhetoric the politicians use to reassure the masses will instead inflame them. In some cases, the rulers suspect that the reformist leadership is lying and is really responsible for mass upheavals and threats co property.
The trick for the reformer is to placate both his popular base and the bourgeoisie. This is not always an easy task, but it has been done. When Andrew Young, Martin Luther King’s former aide and Jimmy Carter’s former U.N. ambassador, took the mayor’s office in Atlanta the capitalists were not overly scared. There had been no real movement by blacks. But Young had employed a populist tone to keep his ties with black voters in the growing economic crisis. So far business has had no need to worry. The president of the Chamber of Commerce and a leading banker told the New York Times (March 20, 1983) that “His first year has been a good one. The business community has been pleasantly surprised. He has gotten things done that others couldn’t.”
That is exactly the point. The Times underlined just what Young has done for capitalism in Atlanta:
For years City Hall had wanted to meet its financial problems with a sales tax increase. In 1979 voters rejected the tax by a 2-to-l margin. In November, after some diligent campaigning by Mayor Young, a similar referendum for a 1 percentage point sales tax increase, to 5 percent, was passed by a margin of 53 percent to 47 percent, with support from poor blacks who would likely be hurt by the additional tax but voted for it anyway because Mr. Young asked them to. After a year, the tax increase is to be accompanied by a dollar-for-dollar decline in property taxes, a relief for corporations and homeowners.
Harold Washington’s tax proposal in Chicago is similar to Young’s in Atlanta, the one that “poor blacks who would likely be hurt” by it voted for because of Young, the one that provided “a relief for corporations.” But the situation is not exactly the same: in Chicago there is an actual black movement that Washington rode to victory. As well, in Atlanta there is a history of collaboration to a degree unknown in Chicago. The ingrained racism of “the nation’s most segregated city” and its bourgeoisie adds to the depth of the chasm between Washington and business. As in the nation as a whole, the bourgeoisie in Chicago is torn between a desire to deal with black leaders in order to keep social peace and the feeling that the system must turn to grinding workers harder – so much so that both leaders and led have to be subdued now.
But Washington has made the start he promised. His transition team includes senior executives of major Chicago banks. In addition, the absence of a black majority (present in several other big cities led by black mayors) acts as a further pressure on Washington to make peace with Chicago’s “invisible government” at whatever cost. Still, to keep his mass base he will have to deliver a few sops. He would surely fire the already resigning Richard Brzeczek – but, as he already warns, there will be few other changes in the racist police force. In general, the small gains that were possible in the 1960’s are out of the question in the present state of capitalism. Washington’s task, like Andrew Young’s, like Coleman Young’s in depression-ridden Detroit, will be to preside over austerity, not sops. And when you are dealing with a hungry movement, that’s a real dilemma. 
Why Electoralism Today?
The Washington campaign reflects not only the bourgeoisie’s need for reformers with popular support to keep the masses in place. It is primarily the product of a genuine, if limited, mass upsurge. But why has there been a response now? Over the years blacks have often been provoked and scorned by white politicians, brutalized by white police, without a mass electoral counterattack. Liberals and leftists have sallied forth time after time to register blacks en masse or to marshall their voices behind a “progressive” candidate – to little avail. The liberals and their leftist camp followers think they know why, beyond Byrne’s provocations, the result was different in 1983: Ronald Reagan. There is truth in this but only half of the truth.
Reagan’s across-the-board attack on poor and working people has certainly hurt blacks worst. Black unemployment is double that of whites, and it climbed by 25 percent in 1982. Black youth unemployment is at 49.5 percent compared to 21.6 percent for whites. And these official figures conceal millions more, as well as the alcoholism, drug addiction and suicide that accelerate as a result.
But blacks have hated Reaganism before this. What delights the liberals and leftists is that now the anti-Reagan sentiment has been congealed into a “solution”; electoralism behind a progressive Democrat. There were hints of this turnabout in last November’s New York elections, but no real movement yet. Previously all the evidence indicated that the growing contempt by white workers for the Democratic Party and liberalism was echoed among blacks as well. Despite the current liberal-left mythology, most blacks have been well aware that Reagan did not cause the economic crisis. He worsened it for workers and the oppressed, while the Democrats and liberals offered no alternative except further austerity.
In the 1960’s when Martin Luther King’s pacifist civil rights campaigns whetted the ghetto’s appetite for a better life but failed to deliver, the masses erupted in riots and rebellions. These in fact produced most of the gains that King and the other leaders couldn’t get. When the ruling class was prosperous and feared civil strife, it was willing to pay off within limits. Today the balance of forces has shifted. Prosperity is gone; the black masses are on the defense. Riots secure little, as Miami has proven more than once. Labor strikes – and blacks in the large cities of the North provide a large portion of the most powerfully situated layers of the working class – have been divided and corralled by the labor bureaucracy and so have led to little but retreats and concessions. Despite all the cynicism, the only alternative to an even worse future that appears to exist is the wretched
Democratic Party.
The Democratic Party, in fact, contains a negative confirmation of the strength of the black working class. Since the 1960’s a number of black leaders have become mayors, congressmen and other elected officials, mainly as Democrats. Propelled into office in the ebbing years of the once formidable mass black upsurge, they were wheeling and dealing and seemed to have carved out a few niches of power. They carried the authority of being recognized as brokers for the black masses by the white rulers. With the collapse of radical black nationalism and the absence of militant labor struggles, the black Democrats appear to offer the only source of power against the Reagans, Byrnes and Brzeczeks. Thus the blacks’ turn to electoralism in large numbers is a defensive move by people who have given up their past hopes for a society of genuine racial equality, full employment and liberation.
The Democratic leaders did not create the new movement, but on the surface they seem to meet its limited expectations at least for the moment. The shift toward the Democrats and electoralism is only an initial reflection of the movement, not a long-term commitment. Despite the present mixed consciousness of the black masses, their needs and political experience will drive them away from this trap. The very strength that blacks have demonstrated acts to undermine the cynicism that limits their aspirations, ones that the Democrats cannot fulfill. Perhaps Jesse Jackson’s comment was more apt than he realized when he said of the February primary, “What you saw was a political riot, disciplined rage.” Demagogues like Jackson have worked to keep blacks tethered to (and their aspirations disciplined by) electoralism, so his choice of words was probably meant more as a threat to the white establishment than anything else. But the explosiveness could burst its electoral channels and undermine the power brokering business of the Jacksons and Washingtons. 
Washington’s Popular Front
One leftist black spokesman who approves of Washington’s form of “discipline” is Manning Marable, a vice-chairman of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Significantly, Marable has criticisms of Washington, whereas DSA itself makes none, at least in public. Marable is not one of the ordinary social-democratic leaders who has toiled in the Democratic Party vineyards for years, like his comrade DSA Chair Michael Harrington (still defending his support of Lyndon Johnson in 1964 – to keep American boys out of Vietnam, remember?) ; Marable long favored an independent black party and is only a recent convert to the Democrats. In justifying his new stance he wrote in the March 16 Guardian:
If we decide to stay out of the reformist battle to mobilize Black voters, simply because Washington is a liberal democrat’ we will alienate and isolate ourselves from the Black masses and inadvertently aid the forces of police brutality, corporate dominance and racism.
We will deal with the charge that not backing Washington aids the capitalists and racists shortly. As to isolation from the masses, contrary to Marable blacks are hardly wedded to electoralism – yet; all the electoral statistics prove that. They will be if the Marables and Harringtons have their way. Marable’s particular sense of isolation stems from the fact that for years the masses ignored the idea of an independent black party. The programs advocated for such a party were for major reforms under capitalism – much the same as the programs of the black Democrats. Which is why people stuck with the Democrats: whatever elements of that program were felt not to be utopian under decaying capitalism were better fought for with a party that existed, had power and ties to the white rulers. A non-existent party couldn’t compete on the same grounds. Black workers have learned to be suspicious of radical rhetoric aimed at narrowly limited ends.
Marable particularly believes that the decisive question is black unity:
The success of Washington’s campaign was from beginning to end a result of the forging of an independent Black united front – ministers and Muslims, trade unionists and professionals, entrepreneurs and the unemployed.

The problem is that such coalitions are inevitably dominated by the entrepreneurs and professionals, as Washington’s pro-business program demonstrates. True, Washington has also promised to improve public health in Chicago and revitalize black and Latino-neighborhoods. But as Marable himself points out, “Any attempt to carry out any significant part of this program will generate the intense opposition of many white ethnics, the corporations and banks”.
Marable is amalgamating two questions: the banks’ and businesses’ objections to real reforms, and working-class (both white and black) opposition to higher tax burdens. Washington has made little or no appeal to working-class interests, despite labor’s backing for him after the primary (beforehand the local AFL-CIO had endorsed Byrne). If the working people in Washington’s “united front” start pressing for their programs, the coalition will break down very quickly. What will the black politicians and entrepreneurs do then, those who depend upon an orderly, stable government? Very little different from their white counterparts: Detroit’s Coleman Young, formerly far to Washington’s left, is now the model black strikebreaker and austerity liberal. Those who are channeling the black liberation struggle into dependence on middle-class and petty-bourgeois elements are the ones who “inadvertently aid the forces of police brutality, corporate dominance and racism.” It is critical for working class people – blacks especially, given their far greater consciousness of the rottenness of capitalist society – to organize themselves independently of all capitalist interests and such electoral fronts.
Marable, an avowed Marxist, has some inkling of this, however corrupted he is by his fear of isolation from the class-collaborationist popular front he describes. When the corporations and police pull out all the stops to hamstring Washington’s program (Marable suffers from the illusion that a capitalist politico like Washington would really carry his efforts that far) Marable notes: “The key here is for progressives to continue the mobilization of the working class, national minority and poor constituents, in the streets as well as beyond the next election.”
But Washington’s front, his “disciplining” of the masses’ rage, is designed precisely to forestall mass action in the streets and in the factories. How many times have working-class militants been told – in Allende’s Chile, Mitterrand’s France, Coleman Young’s Detroit, etc., etc. – “don’t rock the boat; we’ll wheel and deal in the corridors of power.” Washington in power, like Mitterrand, will tragically hold the allegiance, at least for a time, of the masses who put him there (perhaps a long time, given the sharp racial nature of the elections) – and he will use it to carry out his austerity program while his base is momentarily tranquilized. That is the lesson that Marxists should be fighting to teach, no matter how unpopular it makes them for the moment. But there is more.
The real significance of Washington’s coalition is shown by its relation to the traditional Chicago machine. Formed during the 1930’s in order to head off the threat of mass radical politics and unions, the machine rested chiefly on strong white working-class support. Like similar organizations elsewhere, it operated to break up class-wide solidarity by reinforcing the ethnic identities of the different segments of the class. The majority of workers within each group could get little from capitalism. But by identifying with the gains made by the upper layers of their group they could raise their hopes. Thus petty office seekers and petty shopkeepers (some not so petty) became influential, the more so if they could dispense favors. Ethnicity always tends to increase the influence of the petty bourgeoisie over the workers, since this element acts as power brokers between the ethnic group and the ruling class.
Each group vies with each other in showing loyalty to the machine, in order to win a piece of the pie. The machine’s ethnic dynamic and its usefulness for the bourgeoisie was summed up by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, now Democratic Senator from New York, and his academic buddy Nathan Glazer. In an article in Commentary magazine (October 1974) called “Why Ethnicity?”, they noted that ethnic assertion was on the rise and that this was linked to the growth of the welfare state. In modern society it is not useful, they stated,
... to assert claims on behalf of large but loosely aggregated groups such as workers,’ peasants’ ... . Claims of this order are too broad to elicit a very satisfactory response. ... As a matter of strategic efficacy, it becomes necessary to disaggregate, to assert claims for a group small enough to make significant concessions possible and, especially, small enough to produce some gain from the concessions made.
In plain English, Moynihan and Glazer advocated a strategy of abandoning working-class-wide demands which capitalism cannot meet in favor of smaller demands for a privileged few; later others can hope to imitate their success. “Disaggregation” is academic jargon used here to mean class division. The same concerns are voiced by the big bourgeoisie: thus the oft-quoted Wall Street executive Henry Kaufman, in an address to the Economic Club of Chicago two years ago, said that a “fundamental change has been taking place in our society over the past five decades;” the American majority now favors “democracy oriented to an unaffordable egalitarian sharing of production rather than equal opportunity” (In These Times. January 28, 1981).
Translated, this means that capitalism can’t afford to have everyone live well. Instead of such “egalitarian democracy,” Kaufman prefers “equal opportunity” – a few live well while most of us satisfy ourselves with the unfulfillable “opportunity” to do so.
The task of the urban machines was to arrange this “disaggregation” under the banner of “equal opportunity.” Chicago’s machine had an additional New Deal twist: it fattened itself off the federal deficit spending policies that allowed it to grease its operations and prevent rubbing components from overheating. Today, with reduced government revenues and giant deficits constantly in need of refinancing, the machine is wearing out. Chicago’s heavy load of blue-collar job patronage and huge contracts for favored companies who hire the right workers is being undercut by the economy. The obvious point of friction is the ethnic and racial divisions. In the February primary, Byrne took the North Side ethnic wards, Daley the South Side and Washington the blacks.
For Chicago’s machine has rested upon the black population as well. The blacks had their own machine, subordinated to the white, mostly Irish-led operation. The solidity of the blacks and the ability of black politicians to deliver a solid vote contributed to the strength of the white machine. Reciprocally, the white-run hierarchy enforced unity and loyalty on the blacks.
Parallel to the white, the Chicago black machine had ties to the tiny black bourgeoisie as well as with the old-line ministers and storekeepers. The original version under congressman William Dawson had a deservedly Uncle Tom image; Dawson even endeared himself to various Dixiecrats in Washington. But in return for subservience Dawson got his little quid pro quo in patronage and favors.
The black machine was weakened by the civil rights movement and the black power rebellions, when blacks found the strength to fight oppression and not just coexist with it, but it was not destroyed. But more recently it has begun to fracture, like its white counterpart. Especially since the black city population, unlike the white, has been growing: there are more needs and less cash for favors to be doled out. The depth of the economic depression facing blacks has raised the demand for machine aid tremendously. 
Middle-Class Revolt
In Chicago, the machine stymied the civil rights movement but could not itself meet the needs of the expanding black professional layer. The new elements want – like their white counterparts – “clean” government free of not only hustlers and unsavory types but also of inelegant politicians and  storekeepers. Their  education  reflects modern bureaucratic and corporate needs. Their idealism stresses social welfare solutions for the masses’ needs, the bureaucratic version of the old machine favors and patronage. Their belief in their own altruism is unmarred by the fact that they desperately want professional positions in government commensurate with their status. And the machine has been unable to deliver.
The new professional middle-class elements provided the most solid core of Washington’s support in the primary. Obviously the majority of blacks who voted for Washington were workers, given the small number of even relatively affluent blacks. But as David Moberg pointed out in In These Times (March 2), “Especially strong support in the traditionally more independent and slightly better-off neighborhoods of the black south side also compensated for less impressive results in the typically machine-dominated poor wards of the black west side.” (Social-democrat Moberg tried later to downplay the implications of this with the contradictory claim that “Not surprisingly, Washington did best among low-income people.”) Nevertheless, as Washington’s status as a serious candidate grew he picked up more elements of the old black machine. He had always had the support o! the few small “entrepreneurs” who welcomed his popularity and recognized his ability to handle the pork barrel. The “united front” had an old familiar flavor.
Harold Washington was an old machine product who, with his mentor, former congressman Ralph Metcalfe, had had to oppose machine mayor Daley after some particularly vile racist acts in the early 1970’s. But until then he had loyally served Daley in the Illinois legislature. Now he quite loyally reflects middle class ambitions and has promised to junk the patronage system. But he has also sent signals to both white and black machine leaders that he is still willing to deal: “In a sense, I am a product of the machine. I’ve dealt with it for years. It is proper in its place” (Chicago Sun-Times, February 23).
Immediately after his electoral triumph over Epton, Washington renewed his pledge to eliminate patronage (which the courts had just ordered ended anyway). But at the same time he was careful to publicly embrace his machine enemies of just the day before, including ward boss Roman Pucinski, a leader of the Democratic rush to Epton after the primary. There will be no “business as usual,” Washington promised – but business there will be.
Middle-class “issue-oriented” reform movements have taken power from crumbling machines in many cities. Typically they find it necessary to build alliances with elements of the old machine in order to stabilize their rule. They make their own deals as well: instead of filling the government apparatus through appointments at every level from top to bottom in the old Daley manner, they appoint only the top layers, and that is enough to control the new bureaucracies. Their original verve for democratic “good government” disintegrates, to be replaced by their elitism which makes the reformers even less responsive to working-class pressures than the machine. The road from crusader to Koch has been traveled before.
Under the impact of the capitalist crisis the machine has come apart. As a Daley aide put it, “There’s a lot more fragmentation now. No one has the megabutton any more.” Even without Washington and the courts vowing to end patronage, bourgeois reality has already pulled the rug out from under it. The old forms of bourgeois rule are crumbling, but the new middle-class power brokers are seeking new forms to lock in the restless black workers.
While reform regimes, black and white, have won elsewhere, they have rarely done so riding a volatile mass movement as in Chicago. This gives the new administration a far more fragile character than normal. An embryonic “popular front” – to give it its real name – has arisen in black Chicago to play the role the machine can no longer perform: to detour the potentially radical mass movement and tie the revived socially conscious workers to decaying capitalism. 
The Racist Campaign
The steamroller that put Washington in as the Democratic candidate picked up speed as the main issue became race. Democratic Party chairman Ed Vrdolyak, a Byrne backer, told precinct workers: “It’s a racial thing. Don’t kid yourself. I’m calling on you to save your city, save your precinct and keep your friends in office.” After Washington’s primary victory, Byrne endorsed him but then stabbed him in the back with a brief cry at a write-in campaign of her own, obviously largely motivated by the race of the victor. And the Republican candidate, given an unexpected lease on life because of the color of his skin, raised the blatant campaign slogan “Epcon, Before It’s Too Late.” The Police Department served as the center for virulent race-baiting of Washington. Democratic wardheelers went over to Epcon by the bucketload and drummed up fear of a black menace among their constituents. During the electoral campaign these elements organized several viciously racist incidents. There were, however, no mass race riots like those that confronted M.L. King years ago.
The isolation of the blacks reinforced the tendency to stick together and gave Washington considerable support out of solidarity of the oppressed. For blacks are more than just another “community” of ethnics. Vital to the economy, they nevertheless have always been a pariah caste viciously discriminated against and held at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder by strong racial barriers. There have always been lower wage scales and higher unemployment for black workers amounting to significant super-exploitation. (The small but politically important black upper strata have never been able to avoid identification with the black masses nor to escape the barrier of prejudice; they too earn less than their white counterparts and have far greater difficulty obtaining suitable employment.) The division of whites into strongly encapsulated ethnic groups allowed imperialism to nurse an aristocracy of labor into existence as a barrier to class consciousness. However, whites as a whole, including all the white ethnic groups, were allowed to join in the aristocratic ethos – because they could feel themselves rewarded as long as black labor remained qualitatively more victimized.
The attempt to rebuild white solidarity linking the ethnic subdivisions in Chicago after the Byrne-Daley fiasco can only be carried out by wielding the black “threat” as the binding force. If the impact of the crisis has hit blacks, harder, white workers (especially in the industrial Midwest) are also seeing their world fall apart. Economic distress has combined with other social factors to undermine all aspects of their existence, including “their” machine.
Ethnicity was always reinforced by living in common neighborhoods; in Chicago the ethnic communities lasted longer than elsewhere, with less of a post-war white move to the suburbs. They rely on traditional moral and religious standards and strong family ties. But the Catholic church, the ethnic social cement, has been evolving. As well, there are new migrations that replace old; youth gain wider horizons and rebel; old cultural and family ties break down. The crisis sped up all these conditions, as unemployment shook up the family structure even forcing workers to move in search of jobs, vital city services collapsed and crime became rampant. With the growing black urban population desperately expanding its ghettoes, many of the problems white people face could be conveniently blamed on blacks and channeled into racism.
Moreover, the machine’s grip on its mass is weakening, given the social breakdowns and the politicians’, inability to act as go-betweens with government for dwindling services. On top of this, Washington personifies a real threat: if more blacks and social reformers get city jobs, then there is far less for the machine’s remnants. Under these conditions, if the Byrne-Daley split were to continue with an even deeper struggle among the white ethnic groups, then all would be lost for the machine. It had no other card to play but racism.

There has always been racism in Chicago politics, at least partly in consequence of the machine’s interest in maintaining segregation. However, racism was only one impulse among many in the white working class; it was deliberately whipped up when necessary. Thus it is no accident that the racism expressed by white workers during the campaign still carried a significant troubled undertone: people told reporters they were voting white even though they knew something was wrong about that. The attempt by the media and the national Democrats to present the machine politicians as merely responding to irrational mass racism was a direct inversion of the truth. 
The Pro-Democrat Strategy
Only through the binding forces of racism could the Chicago machine hold itself together. But it is not just the machine: maintaining the Democratic Party in any form requires it. The Democratic Party is the chosen vehicle for the task of absorbing class consciousness, chewing it up and destroying it. Machine structure or no, it wields racism to this purpose: witness the slimy mayor Edward Koch of New York, who relies more on high-level public relations than precinct work for his racial slurs.
The only difference between Chicago and the rest of the nation is that here the necessary weapon was used more openly and threatened to get out of control. That is why multitudes of national Democrats who had backed others in the primary rushed to Chicago to force white precinct leaders, aldermen and even congressmen into line behind the candidate. Presidential hopefuls, Southern politicians and even Koch stuck in their contributions. The Kennedy family used its business connections to strangle Byrne’s write-in campaign.
Why? Because a Washington defeat could have provoked a black voter withdrawal from the Democrats nationally; at minimum it would have produced a black presidential candidate in the Democratic primaries in 1984. It might also have set white racist forces in motion in the Democratic Party across the nation. And that would have meant the end of the Democrats’ power, based as it is on burying political polarization by compromising and avoiding “delicate” questions.
The Democratic Party is an assemblage of various groups – ethnic, sectoral and social. The famed New Deal “coalition” was put together very much like the Chicago machine; the same sectors were represented. But the Democrats barely survived the Depression, when workers rose to the heights of industrial unionism and economic class consciousness but stopped short of independent class political action. World War II and the post-war prosperity kept the Party going. Now the return of the crisis has undermined its already fading “coalition” as well as the surviving machines. Under such circumstances blacks are inevitably singled out to be the fall guys, the group officially designated to get nothing. But they form one of the largest groups; their withdrawal would end the Democrats’ “natural” political majority. It could also lead to the collapse of electoralism as a diversion for the masses, at least the black masses – and thereby to social explosions. Hence the concern of Mondale, Kennedy et al. Their future was at stake.
The Democrats term their molecularization of class politics “coalitionism” – the knitting together of discrete interest groups and ethnic groups with separate consciousnesses. Coalitions arrived at through deals among the leader-brokers are fragile at times of social movement. Each of the allied sectors is bisected by class lines when there is a mass following. The petty-bourgeois class outlook of the leadership is fundamentally at variance with that of the mass base, even if there are points of agreement. When the practical struggle breaks out into open movements, the difference between the brokers and the broke is revealed.
Liberals Betray Alliance
In Chicago there were two coalitions that held. One was between the black middle strata and their white counterparts on the Lakefront. The second was the alliance of the black masses behind the black middle class. But even the first of these working coalition was weak: only 39 percent of the liberals, according to polls, were on Washington’s side in the blatantly racist election campaign – a testimony to the puerile nature of liberalism and the fragility of an alliance built on the good will of the affluent. With the machine crumbling, many liberals turned to it, swallowing their previous contempt; the rich have a great stake in stability and therefore in keeping business, the banks and the politicians reasonably happy. 
Harold Washington’s “new Democratic coalition” with the liberals is aimed also at winning sections of the white working class, over time. And the way to try to do this is through its present leaders, like Pucinski. The trade union leaders, for what they are worth in terms of a base that will follow them, are mostly already collaborating. For the AFL-CIO bureaucracy nationally is now an important voice within the Democratic Party, charged with responsibility for heading off any resistance on the industrial front. It has been successful so far, through its electoralism and coalitionist strategy with liberal interest groups (see our “Labor after Solidarity Day” in Socialist Voice No. 15). Registration has recently been rising nationally among the poorly paid and the jobless, white and black. Some of this is due to incessant AFL-CIO propaganda; all of it is due to the bureaucrats’ success in blocking off more volatile forms of struggle.
To gain white support and achieve social peace now that it is in office, the black middle-class leadership is offering to preserve white neighborhoods. Al Raby, Washington’s campaign manager, said, “We’re very interested in community stability” (In These Times, March. 30). This means not only physical preservation but ethnic stability as well. It means preventing “white flight” to the suburbs, which would ensure capital and job losses. It therefore means collusion with the white liberals who don’t have a mass base and with the machine bosses who do, as part of a national alliance among power brokers. 
Washington’s “Stabilization”
But like all capitalist pacts in this society of each against all, this one is doomed to fail. For stability cannot be restored. The masses, white as well as black, sense this and are justly frightened. The attempt to promote an interracial compromise based on the status quo is epitomized by the black middle class’s totally giving up on the forced busing program for school integration that it had championed in the past (with less enthusiasm from working-class blacks whose children were on the front lines of battle). The ethnic sense of community is dissipating, pulverized under the hammer blows of the crisis. Blacks must seek new housing. All need scarce jobs. The interracialist solution is possible only through a class struggle against capitalism, not through compromise within it.
Stabilizing the white neighborhoods along their present lines is a strategy bound up with “struggle” through electoralism and the revival of the Democratic Party. Action to defend people’s interests, when not confined to voting, becomes at best lobbying, rent strikes, pressure tactics and petitions – anything but the industrial action that brings to bear the power of the working class.
Neighborhoods (hardly “communities”) do not have the inherent organization that factories and industries do for workers. Neighborhood consciousness stresses a multiplicity of enemies: not only muggers and addicts, but landlords, merchants, ethnic intermarriage, the kids hanging out, the blacks moving in, the next precinct getting some favor from city hall, the next district getting a favor from Washington, the next state with lower business taxes, etc. As usual, the pulverization of working-class consciousness must single out the blacks as victims – the easiest group to scapegoat and unite the rest against. This is the real program of those who advocate “progress” through the Democratic Party. 
The Working-Class Alternative
In contrast to neighborhood organization, struggle centered on the industrial front teaches in short order who the real enemy is: the capitalists and their political and ideological agents. The potential for united, national and even international struggle lies in the fact that the primary relationship workers share in society is to the means of production.
That is why revolutionaries counterpose industrial action to “community” struggles as a central strategy. Of course, these days local strikes led by defeatist union bureaucrats frequently lead to losses. The real potential in strike action is to open up a fight for a general strike which can unite workers of all stripes against the oppressive system. A general strike inevitably poses the question of who shall rule in society, the bosses with their crisis-ridden capitalism or the workers with their capacity to control, centralize and revitalize industry. In the whirlpool of powerful strike action, workers will learn their strength as a class rather than their disunity as competitors and passive voters. This is the milieu for the revolutionary party to develop in as a real alternative.
In contrast, “community stability” and electoralist discipline over the masses have the potential for disaster. The reformists, liberals and middle-class “socialists” who advocate returning to the status quo of yesteryear feed the fires of class division. When they claim the banner of the left and of anti-racism, they leave only one radical alternative to white workers who are facing what looks like a free fall into disaster: a racist and, in the future, fascist course. Harold Washington’s program of higher taxes and austerity, a replay of what drove Jimmy Caner out of office, won’t fool black or white workers for very long.
The liberal middle class on the Lakefront can afford to be more “tolerant” (to use Moberg’s expression, which he means as a compliment) because their competition with blacks is not as intense. Their moralistic sneering at white workers, their desire to “educate” them that racism is nasty, overlooks one fact that workers understand far better than they: under this system competition for jobs is real and it will indeed be a question of white versus black as long as capitalism remains. It is no surprise that workers have often followed the petty-bourgeois machine leaders rather than the intelligentsia: in this perverted society the former understand reality better. “We want ours” is an accurate response in the land of “opportunity.”
The revival of social movement among blacks in Chicago is a very positive sign. The present uneasy coalition at the top between the black and white liberals and shifting sections of the machine will be only a temporary brake upon mass consciousness if the movement takes off. In the 1930’s there was a genuine, mass class-wide industrial movement. Then the Democratic Party was only the means for distributing sops to the masses, not the weapon for winning them. If the movement accelerates today, the system will be under pressure to dole out more than its leaders wish, although its resources are more limited than even in the 1930’s. The capacity of the embryonic movement to achieve partial aims and then, its appetite whetted, much larger goals, is aided by its leadership’s fragility – but its greatest barrier is the racist division of the class inherent in the Democratic Party set-up.
The black working class is strategic to the economy of both Chicago and the nation. It has the opportunity, when its proletarian consciousness and leadership develops, to lead the entire working class by providing a concrete alternative in action. Militant strikes undertaken despite the AFL-CIO bureaucracy in the early 1970’s showed that white workers even in the South would follow the lead of blacks in struggle for their mutual benefit. Revolutionary propaganda for general strike action among black workers is crucial in Chicago and the nation today.
Whatever happens, the “stability” fought for by the coalition leaders of today will fail. If ethnic solidarity and therefore racist solidarity wins out among whites, reaction is inevitable. The political polarization among white workers in Chicago is real; at the moment its direction is bad, but it can be reversed. The black masses, whose motion is the most significant fact, will undoubtedly break with their present leadership. This does not mean that they will cease to understand the need for racial solidarity as a defense against attack; it means that they will understand that unity can only be achieved without the misleadership of strata too attached to the system. But as the “left,” black and white, maintains its present reformism, the pressure on black workers will be towards a narrow ethnic type of self-identification at the expense of class consciousness. Their modest hopes dashed once again, they will be forced to turn to the dead-end of separatism and nationalism as an answer to the dead-ends of integrationism and electoralism. The tragedy will be that the bankruptcy of liberalism and reformism will leave the masses nothing but reactionary alternatives if the revolutionary, proletarian pathway has not been laid.



At the October 1987 convention of the Rainbow Coalition, Jesse Jackson made the expected announcement  that he was again  running for the U.S. Presidency. This time around he is emerging as a “serious” contender for the Democratic Party nomination. He retains a solid base of support among blacks, and he is also gaining a small but significant following among other oppressed groups, white workers, liberals and family farmers.
hat he lacks in campaign funds he makes up in charisma, the devoted adherence of blacks and the activism and support of left militants. This cadre makes him a real alternative  among a cast of candidates whose chief claim to fame is their tenacious pursuit of mediocrity.
Now as in 1984, the left sees him as building a popular movement capable of  undermining racism and reaction. But there is  discomfort around the new, improved Jackson. 
Retreat on Black Rights
Probably  the stickiest  issue  has been  his reaction to growing racist violence. Given the hopes that black people have vested in him Jackson’s increasing attempts to throw cold water on protest actions have startled those who see him as the herald of a movement.
Last year, for example, in response to the lynch-mob murder of a black youth in Howard Beach New York and the Klan attack on civil rights protesters in Forsyth County, Georgia, mass demonstrations  were held in both communities to assert the right of blacks to exist there. But Jackson insisted: “Let’s not confront each other at Howard Beach or in Forsyth County.”
On Howard Beach he went even further, lauding the role of New York Mayor Ed Koch, who is rightfully hated by every defender of black rights. Jitu Weusi, vice chairperson of the National Black United Front (NBUF) and a leading Jackson supporter in New York, observed bitingly that Jackson, who “has never needed to be approached to come anywhere, was extremely equivocal about coming to New York to play a role in response to the Howard Beach murder. Jackson not only vacillated  in supporting  the militant protest marches  but even kept his distance from the impotent boycott efforts called by black radicals.
While the recent spate of murderous attacks in New York has met with justified outrage by blacks, Jackson turned a cold shoulder to the protestors. He stated he would “challenge those who say racial violence is the dominant  issue in New York City” (New York Times, January 26). The Times added that his “call for conciliation” has dominated his recent activities in New York. This line is a precise echo of Koch’s claims that black militants are exaggerating the problem in order to stir up trouble.
Regarding Jackson’s retreat on black rights, NBUF Chairman Conrad Worrill commented, “We work inside the Rainbow, as an independent formation to make sure the issues of concern to African Americans stay alive. ... I see some tactical changes ’ I mean, he’s going to talk ‘President!’ But, it’s also the reason why we have to stay in this Rainbow room: We are the ones who have to make sure that that’s the only change there.” (Guardian, January 13, 1988)
Obviously Worrill is worried. He has reason to be. Jackson’s real function is above all to hold back black struggle. That is why he’s working within the Democratic Party. It isn’t some flaw in an otherwise progressive  agenda, which is the way  leftists waiting for  him to go “independent” see it. Rather Democratic  Party politics is the essence of Jackson, and Jackson’s conciliation on black rights is not just an isolated presidential maneuver.
The Democratic Party Trap
We have demonstrated  the historical role of the Democratic Party as a deathtrap for popular movements and causes. (see  Proletarian Revolution Nos. 20 and 21.) It acts to divert potential rebellion and self-activity  of the masses into passive support to bourgeois politicians. Nowhere is this more true than regarding the radical black struggles of the 1960s which were destroyed by the Democrats.
Thus by 1984 Jackson could run as a radical but as a radical power broker. He hardly hid his role: trading the growing black voter registration for a piece of the action. This role did not alienate him from his black base. His supporters had already begun to reverse past patterns of rejecting the vote as meaningless. They had begun registering in large numbers prior to Jackson’s efforts, precisely because more militant struggle seemed to have come to a dead-end, given the limits of crisis-wracked  capitalism. Blacks supporting Jackson understood that the Democratic Party was a world of quid pro quo (although each class had different expectations as to the quid they expected to receive.)
But at the 1984 Democratic Convention Jackson did not even get crumbs, despite the impressive numbers of blacks who supported him in the primaries and the big percentage of the total Democratic vote that blacks  represent. He was publicly humiliated, forced to eat crow rather than a piece of the pie. Afterward his dutiful  support for the party   nominee helped secure  the pivotal black vote, thus enabling Mondale to move even further to the right ’ and lose the election anyway.
The Democrats gave the black masses nothing because they had their votes in their hip pocket anyway. While the Democrats want black support, they want to avoid at all costs the idea that they back radical demands or confrontations (which they claim will alienate  whites.) Clearly Jackson learned a big lesson from his 1984 campaign and its humiliating   consequences: cut back on his already modest demands for blacks  and adopt “a more traditional mode.” (New York Times, September 8.)
The ’88 Model Jackson
In 1984 Jackson loudly decried the fact that blacks were systematically   denied the representation at the convention warranted by the votes they cast in the primaries. He emphasized party rules as a way to underemphasize   the issues really disturbing the mass of exploited and oppressed blacks; but he did raise them in an effort to show black power and rock the Democratic boat a bit. Today he keeps the boat on even keel. This has provoked complaints from southern Rainbow activists, who hoped to use the Jackson campaign to make further inroads against the white power structure that rules the Democratic Party.
Maintaining black support while   aborting black struggle is the common policy of all sectors of the Democratic Party except the most overt racists. Jesse Jackson, like Harold Washington in Chicago, came to prominence because of an upsurge reflecting the power of the black masses. At the same time, it was already being derailed into an electoral dead-end. The threat of confrontational upheaval had enabled black politicians to expand their numbers in government and the Democratic Party, but at the same time it was exactly this confrontational  upheaval that the bourgeois   power structure told the black politicians they must end. If the black leaders wanted their party to win they had to become statesmen.
The pro-Mondale black Democrats agreed. While they would upon occasion use the threat of “the black underclass” to warn white colleagues not to go too far, their own ability to exist in the world of bourgeois politics ’ to play the angles in order to get the sops to pass on to their voting bases ’ depended on their ties to the white-dominated  power structure. They all needed the Democratic Party to win. They all viewed  the demands of outraged blacks  as a threat to racial stability, their stability as operators within the system.
In 1984 the moderates did not want to hook up with Jackson, despite his popularity, because it harmed their ties with other sections of the party. In the present campaign, without a dominant frontrunner, they have more leeway. They also know that the question   is no   longer whether to be a Jackson delegate to the convention, but who controls the Jackson delegations. There is room for them to maneuver and broker their own deals at the convention  when Jackson inevitably loses. Having embraced so many differing political power centers among black politicians, Jackson can’t keep as tight a grip on his delegates as last time. 
Under the Rainbow
Accompanying the downplaying of black demands has been a concerted effort to expand Jackson’s constituency beyond his black base. This reflects a second big lesson he learned from 1984: how to get the Democratic Party to take him more seriously. In 1984 the Rainbow was a real myth: Jackson represented blacks ’ a problem to a party that wants black votes but doesn’t want to be identified as pro-black. Now he still must broker for blacks but must also try to the put “the rainbow” in effect, that is attempt to increase his clout with other sectors as well. This is often called his appeal  to whites, but it is necessarily more complex because here again the class question invades.
First, Jackson is under no illusion that he can win the more racist and reactionary   elements among these groups. But he can offset  their hostility and establish himself in the eyes of their leaders as a suitable broker they can deal with. The main effort in this direction is shown by Jackson’s  increased   promotion of ethnic coalitions and all that implies.
Ethnic Coalitions Aid Conservatism
In the 1970s and ’80s the ruling class has attempted to shift popular consciousness  to the right. They beat the drums for God, family, country and every conservative institution. By trumpeting the wonders of ethnic identification and roots, they attempt to play upon deep-seated needs for community,  solidarity and support in a society based on human alienation. Ethnic manipulation serves to destroy working-class consciousness and promote identification with  parochial petty-bourgeois misleaders. Inevitably, given the inherent racism of American capitalism, in times of economic crisis the ethnic honchos play upon mass prejudices to the detriment of the oppressed. (“Our” ancestors came here without  speaking English  and “we” didn’t complain; “our” people made it without welfare so why can’t “they?” etc., etc.) As long as capitalism exists, the idea that it’s a war for sops, jobs and income between  whites, blacks and other minorities seems more and more real.
This mechanism at the heart of the Democratic Party works to make the oppressed black (and Latino) masses view themselves as simply one of many ethnic groups and to tie themselves  to leaders who will produce for them if they play by the rules of the game. This destroys the real strength of black workers, whose unique history of militant struggle against oppression and whose concentration in the major bastions  of   capitalist industry has put them into a potentially powerful leadership position within the working class as a whole.
Congressman William Lipinski, a Democrat from Chicago’s Southwest Side and Co-chairman of the Ethnic American Council of  the Democratic National Committee, is a clear spokesman for the view to which Jackson has tried to adapt. According to the September 16 New York Times, Lipinski said that the party
must make more room for conservative and moderate views, especially on social issues. The ethnic voters are most unhappy ...with the prevailing  views in the Democratic Party about abortion, school prayer, defense spending and affirmative action  programs for minorities. To retain the working-class voter ... the party must stress its pro-labor stand on the pocketbook issues.

We’re trying to remind these people ’ the plumbers, the carpenters, the bricklayers ’ that they wouldn’t have unions and good wages if it weren’t for the Democratic Party.
If he can deal with General Motors and Burger King for black franchises, Jackson can deal with ethnic politicians. They all have a vested interest, he (falsely)  believes, in stabilizing tense relations between ethnics and blacks. He hopes that the more moderate elements  among the ethnic politicians can be brought into a new coalition  that will accept black  leaders   as senior participants based upon voting clout.
It is not that Jackson can really support Lipinski’s conservative social program. he can’t do that and retain his base among radical activists; after all, his successful attempt to bury the abortion issue at the first Rainbow convention noticeably chilled the militants. But he can try to emerge as a conciliator between the conservative ethnic leaders and popular forces, blacks and others, who threaten  their positions and their world views. Still, he must go further  than the Lipinskis in taking a “pro-labor stand on the pocketbook issues.”
This strategy leads to fudging on social questions, particularly  on womens’ rights, because that is an area where traditionalist ethnic leaders have their strongest base of support. It leads to emphasis on questions of the family, God and pulling oneself up by one’s own bootstraps. And Jackson can go further than Lipinski in stressing  a “pro-labor stand on pocketbook issues.”
Jackson’s Labor Appeal
It has become popular to say that Jackson is joining the “mainstream,” but that is only a surface explanation. Jackson is in essence an opportunist, and a brilliant one at that. Before pundits, pollsters and even revolutionaries can, Jackson is able to sense the direction of the masses he seeks to win. After all, his very political existence depends upon his ability to tail popular consciousness and adapt to it. Therefore he was way out in front in recognizing that “mainstream” attitudes in America today weren’t the epitome of moderation  and economic conservatism that other political observers claimed. For years he sensed the growing anger and frustration of workers and petty-bourgeois elements in American society. Seeing the anger beneath the surface, Jackson began to appeal to the growing class antagonism earlier than others.
His basic speech in the Iowa campaign reflects his radical approach to workers  and small farmers. It is dotted with phrases  like “We’re caught between cheap labor at home and slave  labor abroad”;  “If we can bail out Chrysler...we can bail out the family farm”; and “Workers united will never be defeated.” (New York Times, January 18). Heady stuff.
However, the labor bureaucracy has withheld its support. One obvious  reason is racism: many a white bureaucrat will simply not support a black candidate. Related to this is the racist-tinged pragmatism of which the bureaucracy has such a bountiful supply; as the argument goes, Jackson can’t win so let’s find a more realistic candidate, meaning a white. And many bureaucrats find Jackson too radical. His increasing  moderation   on foreign  policy is hardly enough to satisfy an AFL-CIO leadership which embraces  the CIA and the contras and loves Israel, oppression and all.
Even more appalling to the bureaucrats, Jackson voiced support for militant actions like the Hormel strike at a time when the AFL-CIO leadership was actively trying to destroy that struggle. It’s a sad commentary that a bourgeois politician can come across as a better champion of struggling workers than the alleged leadership of the working class. 
Bureaucrats Soft on Jackson?
Nonetheless, the bureaucracy  is giving Jackson more leeway than in the last election. He is a welcome guest at labor gatherings. His picture is in union newspapers alongside the appropriate bureaucrats. He even received  a warm ovation at the ultra-conservative   Teamsters’ convention.
The top leadership of the AFL-CIO still hasn’t recovered from the humiliating defeat of “their man,” Fritz Mondale. As a result of the 1984 fiasco, the lesson they learned was that labor can’t be too quick or too prominent in supporting a nominee lest he be castigated as a prisoner of “special interests.” Besides, who in the current field of candidates can command their support like Mondale?
One factor in the receptivity to Jackson is the strong support he enjoys among many  black workers, who comprise almost a third of the AFL-CIO membership; the bureaucrats are being careful not to appear to discriminate against Jackson. Polls among the Communications Workers (CWA) and the Federal, State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) found Jackson to be their favorite candidate. Jackson has the overwhelming support of blacks in other unions as well. Added to that is the active sympathy he has among hard-hit white workers in the Midwest and elsewhere.
This doesn’t make Jackson a champion of the ranks against the bureaucracy. It does make him an ally of the more left bureaucrats. The only national official who so far has openly bucked the AFL-CIO decision to delay all endorsements is Henry Nicholas, head of the National Union of Hospital and Healthcare Workers. Others, like Kenneth Blaylock of the Government Employees (AFGE), William Winpisinger of the Machinists and leaders of the CWA are known Jackson allies who have shied away from pushing for open endorsement  of their unions ’ in much the way they operated during the Hormel strike.
Then there are locally prominent black labor leaders like Stanley Hill, head of the large AFSCME section in New York, DC 37, who publicly supports Jackson. Together they constitute a significant  portion of the leftish labor bureaucrats, many of whom are members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).
Jackson’s support of the Hormel strikers was of course accompanied by his offer to mediate the strike and an open attempt to pacify it. Even the local sheriff who led the assaults on P-9 praised Jackson’s role. While the strike was anathema to the dominant AFL-CIO leadership, it was supported sub rosa by much of the left bureaucracy as part of the shadow war they are waging with Kirkland and Co.
Of course, like Jackson they avoid any open break with the AFL-CIO-CIA leaders. They are simply fearful of the growing trend towards union-busting. They welcome limited rank and file actions as a pressure on Kirkland to do something, but always within the context of not forcing an open fight in which the ranks might get out of hand. Some ’ not all ’ talk about an eventual mass movement to pressure  the Democrats. Because they, like Jackson, anticipate the coming upsurge, they want to be sure it is under their control. The last thing they want is an independent movement of workers.
The left bureaucrats, like their more right-wing colleagues, have for many years tried to channel workers’ anger and frustration into electoral support of the Democrats. They differ with the Kirklands in that while they will inevitably  back any Democrat, they want to push for a more populist nominee. Jan Pierce, National Vice-President of the CWA, writing in the DSA press in defense of the union’s “Jobs with Justice” campaign, expressed  his hopes that the campaign would
convey an important message to labor and its supporters as more and more organizational resources are devoted to electing a Democrat ’ any Democrat ’ to the presidency next year. I believe that the changes organized labor needs to survive ’ much less revive ’ are not likely to occur solely as a result of ending Republican rule in 1988. And if we look to the Democratic Party (as currently constituted) to be our automatic saviour, we are in for some serious disappointments akin to those experienced by trade unionists during the Carter era. (Democratic Left, September-October 1987.)
If you remember that the Vice President during the “Carter era” was the AFL-CIO’s candidate in 1984, you see the hidden barb aimed at Kirkland. Pierce and his friends   want  a candidate who will go further to defend the unions and workers’ aspirations. Jackson is a fitting Democrat in that respect. His electoral program is as ephemeral as the program of “Jobs with Justice.”
Naturally, Jackson’s stance on labor contains vague talk about supporting workers “in all kinds of struggles” but no mention of encouraging self-action or unifying the isolated strikes that break out in this period ’ and certainly no advocacy of the mass strikes, sit-downs and social rebellions, actions labor undertook when it was indeed a movement in the 1930s. It was the mass movement from below threatening to destroy capitalism   that forced Franklin Roosevelt to grant reforms. Jackson’s reform promises today serve only to preempt and prevent such a social  movement.
The only sort of “movement” planned for the rank and file is the movement to the polling places. Contrary to the illusions of the Rainbow activists,  Jackson is not using the vote to encourage mass action but to detour it into passive electoralism. As he proclaimed to Iowa workers and farmers, “Now the time has come. I’ve stood with you, day in and day out. Stand with me, just one night: February 8.”
Sectoralism and the Left
Jackson’s overture to white workers is based on stressing the pocketbook while pushing socially conservative issues and downplaying black responses to racial attacks. It is simply the flip side of his approach to black workers. His message to whites tells them to adhere to their petty-bourgeois ethnic power brokers and the labor bureaucrats. After all, his immediate base has always been in the black small business community, adroit at riding the movement tide to secure new positions in corporate society.
As Jackson has moved toward playing by the rules of the Democratic power brokers, some nationalist black radicals have objected. Weusi is a good example of those Rainbow activists whose criticism of Jackson’s line on Howard Beach was dictated by opposition to his overtures to white workers. Weusi stated (in the previously cited article):
Many of us would like the opportunity to discuss problems we had with his sermons, in particular some of the analogies he made comparing Harlem and Howard Beach as ‘different sides of the same coin.’ ... I disagree with the analysis of Jesse Jackson when he tries to place Howard Beach in some kind of class context that downplays the traditional  white racist character of this community.
Weusi, as a radical petty-bourgeois black nationalist, sees black defense  and working-class defense as counterposed  interests,  with Jackson capitulating to the latter. In this Weusi and other sectoral leftists mirror the outlook of Jackson and most Democratic politicians:  they equate white workers with the racist Howard Beach murderers. To appeal to such workers, they imagine, you have to sacrifice militant black protest. The mainstream  Democrats  are willing to do so; Weusi is not, not yet.
Separatists like Weusi once adored Jackson because he seemed to push independent black power. But the ethnic brokerage game always features leaders who initially  build a mass following  by stressing  group power ’ as a means to position themselves better for bargaining. Because it is impossible for any oppressed group in American society to go it alone,   all sectoralists, even nationalists, inevitably end up dealing away the interests of their mass base.
Jackson Defends Imperialism ...
Jackson has submerged his previously radical rhetoric in favor of a more open   imperialist stance. That was the third lesson he learned from 1984: the Democrats demand proofs of loyalty to U.S. imperialism. So for example, when hawkish Senator Al Gore criticized his primary opponents for not being militant enough cold warriors, Jackson responded as a defender of the Democratic Party’s   moderate but entirely imperialist line:
Mr. Jackson suggested that Gore was outside the Democratic ‘mainstream’ on military issues. ‘The antics and the tactics are attention getters,’ Mr. Jackson said of Mr. Gore. ‘But they do not represent good tactics or sound leadership’. (New York Times, October 8.)
A far cry from his anti-imperialist rhetoric of 1984.
In a recent debate over Reagan’s policies in the Persian Gulf, Jackson said that he did not favor an immediate end to the reflagging of Kuwaiti oil tankers (the excuse for the U.S. naval intervention). Thus his position on the Gulf is to the right of other Democratic candidates in the “mainstream.” The militant Jackson of yore who blisteringly attacked the U.S. military now equivocates over Reagan’s “Star Wars” scheme for a massive military build-up.
Even such a Jackson well-wisher as journalist Alexander Cockburn has had to comment on his blatant defense of imperialism. In his December 23 column in In These Times, Cockburn noted that during a nationally televised  debate, Jackson was asked whether the presence of a “Soviet satellite  in Central America” would bother him. Jackson’s response was  revealing: “If we support self-determination and aid economic development ... we can win Nicaragua.” Cockburn was prepared to swallow this crap ’“Excepting the unattractive conceptual connotation of ‘win,’ this is all right” ’ but he went on to quote the rest of what Jackson said:
Yes, we should negotiate bilaterally  with Ortega. No foreign military advisers. No Soviet base. And if they, in their self-determination, choose to relate to the Soviets in that way, they must know the alternative. If they are with us, there are tremendous benefits. If they are not with us, there are tremendous consequences. If we are clear ... the response will be clear.
This overt defense of U.S. imperialism was too much. Cockburn commented: “In other words, if you are not with us, you are against us ’ and in case you are wondering what this means, read up on the history of Guatemala.” As Cockburn understands, Jackson not only defends U.S. imperialism and the cold war with the USSR but is prepared to invade   Nicaragua to do it. Cockburn is more honest than the rest of his playmates on the left but he too has no alternative to the “progressive” thrust of Jesse Jackson.
... And Loves Capitalism
Cockburn and Weusi are hardly alone in trying to understand what Jackson is up to. At the same time that the bulk of the left has been issuing clarion calls for “economic   justice,” jobs, and an end to plant closings and corporation bailouts, Jackson is reassuring the ruling class that his aim is to save the capitalist system, not destroy it. In response to the Wall Street crash Jackson preached:
We are all in the economic trenches now, even if, on Wall Street, the trenches  are mahogany-lined. Layoffs, farm foreclosures, bank failures, rising debt and falling wealth are our common ground. Wall Street and LaSalle Street [Chicago’s financial center] cannot escape Main Street and Rural Route 3. We are one. (New York Times, November 1.)
Jackson called  for an “economic Camp David” ’ bringing together business, labor, Wall Street and politicians ’ to find a way to cut budget deficits and restore economic health. This has nothing in common with defending the masses; instead it lays the basis for a capitalist austerity program: “Let’s all share the burden just as we’ve all shared the wealth.” This garbage is meant to convince working people to accept cutbacks, under the illusion that the rich will suffer too. We’ve all heard this “equality of sacrifice” line before.
Jackson’s  remarks can’t be dismissed as “acting Presidential.” When he reassures business of his loyalty to capitalism, it is no act. In a letter to Business Week (June  1), Jackson proclaimed:
I wish to make clear the positive aspects of my position on economic policy: a realistic concern about the practices of  American businesses that tend to place  short-term profits ahead of the well-being of their employees, their communities, the nation, and their own future financial health.

To point out these problems and to call for  their correction is not ‘business bashing.’ A strong, healthy private economy is essential to our national well-being and our hopes for social progress. The future of the business Establishment and of  the nation itself are dependent upon attention to the long-range effects of current American business policies.

The long-term interests of American business and the American people are mutual and inseparable.
Whereas Jackson laments that present  policies weaken “our ability to compete in international markets,” the reality of American capitalism is that in times of trouble big business always has always said to blacks and working people, what are “we” going to do? But contrary to Jackson it isn’t “our” country nor “our” system ’ not until the socialist   revolution sweeps away racist capitalism.
Jackson’s working-class appeal is a dangerous trap, but it reflects a correct perception that the working masses are on the road to a new upsurge of class power. The rest of the motley crew of Democratic  aspirants also see this; following Jackson, their rhetoric has shifted noticeably to the left to capture workers’ dissatisfaction. In his letter to Business Week, Jackson concurred with the magazine’s earlier comment which “correctly  suggests  that my attack on economic violence is setting a tone being echoed by other Democratic   Presidential candidates.”
What Jackson sensed is now confirmed; the rest of the crew has finally smelled the same scent. “The Rev. Jesse Jackson’s attack on ‘big corporations’ has been picked up by Mr. Gephardt especially.” And Gephardt is not alone. Even former Arizona governor Bruce Babbitt, who set the troops on striking copper workers at Phelps Dodge, now calls for   “workplace democracy.” (New York Times, January 17.) Babbitt has even attacked on Iowa’s large meatpacking company, IBP  Inc., for its union-busting activities.
The impact of class anger has surfaced even in the Republican Party. Senator Bob Dole, of all people, has been doling out attacks  on “Preppie” George Bush and his “country club followers” from the vantage point of one who “started at the bottom.”
A new movement is nearing, but the left overlooks that the electoral “leaders” ’ even the Democrats, even Jesse Jackson ’ aren’t trying to build it. They are desperately working to detour it so that it doesn’t  endanger the capitalist system they all worship. 
The Black Struggle
The pro-Jackson leftists  who are   nervous about his ethnic-sectoralist coalition-building inside the Democratic  Party want to do the same thing outside. The result would be disastrous either way. Both strategies rely on divisions within the working class necessary for capitalism’s divide-and-conquer methods. Bargaining for crumbs at the top   inevitably masks the growing reality of crisis-ridden capitalism  below, where one group is turned against the other in pursuit of survival.
For blacks to weaken their struggle  against racist violence means feeding fuel to the fire. Blacks are not simply another ethnic group that can follow the mythical path to integration and prosperity. They are a huge minority to which decadent capitalism cannot  grant equality, economic or social. They are the scapegoat U.S. capitalism needs to save its skin, cast to the bottom of the economic ’ ladder and consequently painted as a permanent threat to other workers. Waving a flag of retreat now would be the signal for an assault on all gains blacks have made and the system can no longer afford.
Black workers are critical for the coming upsurge in class struggle. They cannot win jobs without leading a fight for employment for all; they won’t achieve a decent standard of living unless all workers do; they can’t defeat racism except by demonstrating  that class struggle is infinitely preferable to racist idiocy for white workers as well as blacks. In their own interest they need to lead the working class to smash racism and poverty by overthrowing capitalism. And they have the power to take the lead.
Workers will create their own movement, not condescending  bourgeois saviors or even well intentioned left organizers.  In doing so they will recreate their own revolutionary party, a party which will not say that what is good for General Motors is good for workers. Our class is learning in practice that salvation lies not in chasing rainbows but in proletarian socialist revolution.



The primaries are finally over. The seemingly endless electioneering and windbag speeches have given way to the festivals of more political rhetoric and backstabbing known as the party conventions. Meant to be showcases for the Democrats and Republicans, the conventions serve to reveal the crisis of leadership facing the U.S. capitalist rulers.
In order not to further alienate the masses of working people hostile to the system that offers them so meager a choice, both parties strive to say as little as possible. The Democrats have written a platform of only 3500 words, around one-tenth the size of their 1984 document. The best candidates appear to be those who stand for nothing and pledge to do nothing. In the words of Theodore Sorenson, the chief architect of this year’s Democratic platform, “brevity is the soul of victory.”
Besides the ever-present fear that a candidate might open his mouth and blow the election, there are good reasons for such political evasiveness. The truth is that the capitalist system faces a serious economic and political crisis – as evidenced by the Iran-contragate affair, the October 1987 stock market crash and Reagan’s attempt to win a place in history by negotiating with the “evil empire.” On the world scene U.S. imperialism is still king of the hill, but its grip has loosened considerably. None of the candidates for bourgeois leadership have any answers to the crisis, and the ruling class fears that open discussion of the real situation would arouse the frustrated U.S. working class.
For the Republicans, the only question is how much can George Bush grovel before the Reaganite conservatives at the convention. For Michael Dukakis and the Democrats, it’s time to get down to the “Let’s Make a Deal.” The big problem is how to deal with Jesse Jackson. Does Dukakis come to an accommodation with Jackson and antagonize those whites who have been voting more against Jackson than for Dukakis? Or does he give Jackson nothing and antagonize Blacks and left activists into sitting out the election? 
It’s Jackson’s Dilemna Too
Jackson’s success in the primaries presents a problem to him and his backers as well. He has a large bloc of delegates, and the expectations of his primary base among Black voters are much higher than in 1984; a sellout like last time will be much more difficult to carry off. Jackson is afraid to use his clout to lead a fight that would split open the convention. He has worked too hard at being a good Democrat, even to the point of turning the other cheek when attacked by the racist Mayor Koch, to throw his newfound respectability away.
However, if Jackson plays the role of the loyal party man and doesn’t make a fuss at the convention, he may well come away empty-handed again. And at this point there is little to indicate that Dukakis will yield much. Unlike Mondale, who had the support of the Black political establishment and who contested Jackson for the Black vote in 1984, Dukakis is winning with virtually no Black support and little effort to appeal to Black voters. The Democratic strategists take the Black vote for granted; their concern is to win over or neutralize the more conservative and racist white voters, particularly in the South.
Faced with this situation, Jackson has played with efforts to put his name forward for vice-president. He knows his chances are slim to none, and most observers doubt he even wants the position. Nevertheless, he is using it as a bargaining chip to try to force Dukakis into making a deal that will allow him to save face with his supporters.
Dukakis is more than just a liar when he says he makes no deals. Such statements represent an appeal to racist whites who don’t want to see deals involving 
Blacks and other minorities who they claim “are getting everything handed to them.” Concessions to Jackson, who ran a strong campaign as a loyal Democrat, are called deals, while the deals proposed to the conservatives to nominate a Southern politician like Albert Gore or Sam Nunn as vice-president are labeled good politics. Does anyone not believe that if Jackson were white he would be offered a deal with no questions asked? The more boosters point to Jackson’s success as proof that the country and the Democratic Party are not racist, the more the exact opposite is revealed.
At best Jackson will get only the crummiest of crumbs. He has already indicated that there will be no fight over the platform that commits the party to nothing. Except for some changes in party rules and a proposal to place South Africa on the “terrorist” list (which normally includes only Nicaragua, Libya and other countries that challenge U.S. imperial domination), Jackson has little to show for his efforts. His allies downplayed their defeat on issues like Palestinian self-determination, which “were not considered matters of principle by most Jackson delegates.” (New York Times, June 27.) The reason is that dereliction on genuine matters of principle will never chase away the leftist Jackson activists, who are committed to the Democrats no matter what.

Dukakis wants to move in an even more conservative direction and aims to show the ruling class that he is not giving in to the demands of Blacks and the oppressed. Like all the Democratic candidates – and this includes Jackson – Dukakis’s real program is austerity. Echoing what used to be considered traditional Republicanism, the Democrats expound fiscal conservatism. Jackson even boasts that he and not Dukakis has a plan to balance the federal budget. (Not surprisingly, the cutback in military spending ballyhooed by Jackson’s left tails became a mere “freeze” when they got down to business.)

Where Jackson and Dukakis differ is that Jackson attempts to give austerity a more populist appeal. He emphasizes that the stockbroker and the worker are both on the same footing, so “we” all must sacrifice. Jackson throws dust in the eyes of the working people in order to blind them to the reality that capitalism itself is based on exploitation.
Jackson’s Real Role
Jackson will of course tell Blacks and other oppressed groups to vote for Dukakis because the main task is to defeat the Republicans. He will show the Democratic establishment that he places the interests of the party above the interests of his supporters – that he will stab his own followers in the back to preserve party unity.
Jackson’s leftist supporters will inevitably follow their messiah into the Dukakis camp. Much of the left has loyally backed him as he sinks deeper into the role of a regular Democratic politician. As their hope that Jackson will lead a break with the Democrats becomes more and more absurd, the leftists will have little alternative but to follow the leader.
Indeed, support to the Jackson campaign by labor and left spokesmen only helps them deliver workers and oppressed people to the Dukakis fold. A Times article pointed to the role of one Black union official, Al Murchison, first vice president of Local 731 of the United Automobile Workers in New Jersey. “Mr. Murchison said his support for Mr. Jackson in the primary would make it easier for him to bring Jackson supporters to Mr. Dukakis’s side.” (June 5.)
Already elements like the Guardian newspaper have adapted their politics to justify capitulation:
Because Jackson is running as a Democrat, some on the left have argued against supporting his campaign, saying it reinforces the 2-party system that has impeded the development of working-class politics in the U.S. But the Jackson campaign has already shown its potential for rocking the foundations of the Democratic Party that takes working-class and minority support for granted while representing bourgeois interests. Some have also stressed the possibility that Jackson will ‘sell out’ at the convention and support a conservative Democrat. But for most of the left this concern is clearly overshadowed by the campaign’s profound progressive potential.


With its working-class perspective and constituency, the Jesse Jackson campaign is certain to sharpen the class contradiction within the Democratic Party as the candidate continues to rack up primary votes and delegates. This process will help lay the basis for the left’s longer-term goal: the development of an independent, anticapitalist political movement. In the meantime, Blacks and other oppressed groups, workers and their allies are gaining important experience struggling for empowerment in the electoral arena.
What a combination of cynicism and muddleheadness! These “leftists” are not the least bothered that Jackson supports the bourgeois Democrats or that he will sell out at the convention. However, to make reality a bit more palatable, they argue that there is a class contradiction within the Democratic Party. This really signifies that the party is multi-class and not bourgeois in essence, and that it can do better than betray its mass following. Of course, the leftists’ long-term goal is an independent “anticapitalist” party. But in the meantime, the workers and oppressed can gain “experience” inside a pro-capitalist party. Presumably this holds true for the Guardian types as well.
On the one hand the left tells the masses to work inside the Democratic Party until an independent party is built. On the other, it justifies its own subservience to the Democrats by arguing that that’s where the masses are to be found. Yet as the mockery of the Rainbow Coalition demonstrates, what these leftists mean by an independent party is only a more left, populist version of the Democrats.
Ultimately, the left is confronted by the logic that if it is going to confine the struggle to reformism, why build a third bourgeois party if the Democratic Party is open to reform? Only by fighting for a revolutionary communist alternative can the stranglehold of the Democrats over the workers and oppressed be broken.
Unfortunately, the masses have had more than their share of “experience” with the Democrats. There is no class contradiction in the party’s role. But there is a class division within the Black movement between the oppressed workers and the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois leadership, including Jackson. A necessary task in the struggle to build a revolutionary party will be to free the most critical section of the working class – the Black workers – from their pro-bourgeois leaders.
When that occurs the working class will gain a new experience: political power pointing to the end of exploitation and oppression. It will be a gigantic step toward what society really needs: not a new capitalist paint job but a total socialist reconstruction.




The following dialogue did and did not take place. Yet the questions posed here are fought out between radical-liberal-populist “socialists” and authentic Leninists every day. The left leaders in the “Anybody but Bush” camp are selling out the growing number of activists and workers who want a real end to the deepening attack on the masses, here and abroad.
Bush the Imperialist Reactionary
Q. George W. Bush’s is a qualitatively worse administration than any other in memory; he is a near-fascist. Look at the Patriot Act and the chauvinist attacks on Muslims and dissenters that rip up the Constitution. How can you not support a Democrat to get rid of this reactionary?
A. Bush is a particularly rotten, reactionary and racist capitalist, but the Democrats are no alternative. The current bunch supported Bush’s repressive legislation and even initiated its predecessors under Clinton. Bush’s Patriot Act is criminal and chauvinist—but still not quite as bad as the crime of Franklin Roosevelt, the liberal Democratic demigod, in throwing thousands of Japanese-Americans into concentration camps. Liberal presidents as well as reactionaries engage in criminal acts against oppressed and exploited people. It is part of the job description.
When you demagogically claim that violating democratic norms makes Bush a near-fascist you are deluding people: real American fascism would mean far worse subjugation of Blacks, Latinos, Jews, Muslims and immigrants—plus the crushing of the unions and the termination of all rights to free speech. You are trying to panic people into voting for the Democrats. And you are covering for the run-of-the-mill capitalist politicians, war criminals and autocrats all. 
Q. So you admit that Bush is a rotten reactionary! I still ask you, how can you not support a Democrat against Bush?
A. Where do you get that “admit” garbage? We have said all along that the President of the United States is a filthy imperialist, the greatest terrorist on the planet today! Osama bin Laden is a piker compared to this mass killer. But we also remember when you (or your mommy and daddy) told us that we had to support the Democrat Lyndon Johnson to stop Barry Goldwater, the Republican reactionary (and “fascist”) who would plunge the U.S. deeper into the Vietnam War. Who plunged imperialism deeper, the liberal or the reactionary?
Q. That was yesterday. What about the war on Iraq today, in violation of international law? What about Bush giving the Israelis free rein to imprison and murder Palestinians?
A. What about all the Democrats who supported the war? How many, even now, even pretend that they would end the imperialist occupation of Iraq? Not one. As for international “law,” it is whatever the White House says it is. Clinton set the precedent for Bush in his war on Serbia a few years ago. And on Israel, the Democrats’ “peace process” and Bush’s “road map” differ on only secondary questions. Both cover for the misery and massacres inflicted on the Palestinians.
Capitalist politicians have differences over particular wars. The ultra-reactionary chauvinist Patrick Buchanan was a far more adamant opponent of both Iraq wars than any liberal Democrat. Whatever their disagreements on this or that war, they all defend American imperialism, which must spread its tentacles throughout the world if it is to survive. They have no choice.
Yes, Bush has overseen a dangerous turn in American politics. But the LRP has hammered away at the fact that the turn represents a widespread bourgeois understanding about U.S. imperialism’s need to maintain its grip over an unstable world. Some sectors of the ruling class still don’t get it, but look again at the bipartisan support for his war. Disagreement was mostly over cosmetic questions, not the blood-soaked invasion and occupation. The Democrats are a lesser evil only rhetorically. No Democratic president is going to stop the profit-gouging drive against working people abroad or at home.
Democrats: Capitalism’s Softer Cops
Q. Bush’s “war on terrorism” is killing innocent people in Afghanistan and Iraq today! We have to end this now. After that, we can move on to deal with underlying issues.
A. That’s what you types said during Vietnam and every other war. But the Democrats are part of the problem and not even a temporary solution. As our lead article shows, Kerry, the likely Democratic nominee, is demanding a bigger and longer-term U.S. military presence in Iraq. By backing a “lesser evil” rather than fighting for a real alternative, all you are doing is enabling the next imperialist war, and all the wars after that. And ensuring that someone like you will then say, OK, but let’s vote for the Democrat now to end this war, and then tomorrow ... .
By the way, look at how many innocent Yugoslavs and Somalis Clinton murdered—not to speak of the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis killed by starvation and disease in the eight years of Clinton’s sanctions. And which party’s imperialist president was it that actually used nuclear “weapons of mass destruction”? And against civilians! 
Q. You can’t seriously mean that the Democrats are the same as the Republicans. Look at Bush’s reactionary judges, his tax cuts for the rich, his handouts to the corporations. 
A. I don’t say they’re the same; just that the Democrats are no answer to the Republicans. Both parties are inextricably tied to the capitalist system and must defend it at home and abroad. (And both have long records of handouts to the corporations.) Normally, they defend the system in different ways. At home, the Republicans are the “hard cops,” the Democrats softer. The liberals’ job is to pretend they are on the side of beleaguered workers, racially oppressed people, unemployed and the overburdened middle class. When the masses rise up, the Democrats make some concessions. These are meant to contain and detour workers, not at all to meet their increasingly desperate needs.
Today, when capitalism is caught in a fundamental crisis throughout the world, the system cannot easily give sops. Given the evidence of Clinton, any Democratic administration is going to roll back past gains just like the Republicans, with only verbal sops. They are just as big liars as the Republicans ... 
Q. Oh, don’t start with the Clinton-Lewinsky “no-sex” bit. 
A. That’s not my point. Clinton’s attacks on the working class were disguised; remember his milk-the-poor workfare, styled as “welfare reform”? It not only attacked working-class people directly; it also paved the way for Bush’s “tax reform” designed to enrich the rich. And “tort reform” to protect the insurance profiteers and the medical establishment from malpractice suits. Clinton launched a whole series of lightly disguised assaults on gains won by workers and Black people. They paved the way for the capitalist looting orgy now going on.
Q. OK, but there are sincere liberal spokesmen too.
A. They’re worse in a way, because they can better sell the take-away programs which have soaked the workers and the unemployed over the last three decades and opened the way for Bush. Given the acts of their “friends,” workers became more and more frustrated, disarmed and cynical—seeing no way to fight back. Our point is that the Democrats softened up the masses for the even more devastating attack which is now coming. Supporting Democrats to stop Republicans isn’t using fire to stop a fire; it is fueling a growing conflagration.
Democrats: The Masses’ Party?
Q. Look, whatever you say, the Democrats are preferable to  the Republicans—it’s just obvious. That is why workers, Blacks, Latinos, pro-environment and anti-war people support the Democrats. We who want to mobilize the people and get them to fight back against the current attacks must relate to the Democratic Party.
We progressives are not blind followers of the Democratic politicians. We want to use the elections to stimulate a populist upheaval; that is the way to stop Bush’s attacks. We know it takes mass mobilizations to stop the corporate assault. The old-line Democratic apparatus hated Dean for example, because he put together an opposition full of non-elite types in order to take over and toss them aside. The Democratic Party is the party of the social movements. You can’t deny it!
A. No? I just want to make one little change in your claim. Rather than calling it the “party” of the social movements, substitute the word “graveyard.”
Look at Kerry and the drop-out also-rans, the populist-come-latelies after Dean’s campaign caught fire. Do you take Edwards’ law court-trained “sincerity” seriously? Do you believe that they will honestly carry out their populist pap if they win? You know it’s a pack of lies. And saddling the next mass struggle with populist ideology means trying to strangle it in advance. For all their rhetoric, even the “left” candidates, Kucinich and Sharpton, and the “movement” man, Dean, never once used their platforms to mobilize the mass actions or movements you claim to want. What they want is good citizens passively voting to achieve “progressive” goals. Their function is to demobilize potential mass upsurges, not encourage them. And your function is to cover for them.
The gains made by workers and oppressed people under capitalism come from mass, class-based struggles that threaten to transcend the system. That forces the capitalist politicians to try to buy them off. The trade union bureaucrats, like the Black, Latino and immigrant leaders, are tied to the Democrats. When the movements are explosive, the leaders and the “left” Democrats sound fierce. Their populist rhetoric blames evil corporations but not the capitalist class system, and sets up an appeal for the Democrats. Remember how Jesse Jackson led an angry Black struggle back into the Democratic Party in the 1980’s? 
As soon as the movement is demobilized, the leaders play the “special interest” game. Each sector competes within the Democratic Party for a larger share of whatever scraps of patronage and sops are still left: Blacks vs. Latinos, whites against both, U.S.-born workers against immigrants, and on and on. Instead of uniting in the struggle for solid gains for all, the leaders fight each other for tidbits and whip up rivalries among the followers. The once promising struggles are then dead; all that remains is populist rhetoric on the tombstones.
Backing Democrats Means Calming Struggle
Q. OK, I agree that social gains are won by mass struggles. I’m an activist myself. But how does that conflict with also voting for the Democrats to get rid of Bush? I can favor both.
A. If you’re at all serious about the need to elect Democrats, it certainly does conflict. If you really mean “Anybody but Bush,” you have to push for the most moderate, “electable,” Democrat. And before you know it you’ll be calculating how to win over swing voters; then you’ll worry that mass protests and strikes had better wait until after the election. That’s how the Black leaders and union bureaucrats figure—stay calm, make sure “our” side wins in November. If you want the Democrats to win at all costs, then you had damned well do all you can to keep mass struggle out of the picture.
The Democratic Party is a death-trap for the struggles of the exploited and oppressed. You reformists are judas goats, helping to lead the working class to the slaughterhouse. You have nearly obliterated the fundamental principle of socialism, that the independent working class must re-create its own revolutionary party and put an end to class collaboration.
A genuine working-class party, a revolutionary party, would tell the truth about the system and fight for mass struggles. It would seek to take leadership of these struggles from the middle-class populists who inevitably sell out workers and oppressed people. Anyone who rightly hates Bush for stomping on working people should be equally sick of the Democrats. Join us in the struggle to demand that the unions lead a general strike to stop the capitalist attacks on jobs, wages, health care and the masses at home and abroad.



The League for the Revolutionary Party has an absolutely unique position on military conscription in the imperialist countries. We share it with Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky, but with no other group we know of on the American left scene. So it is little wonder that when  we restated our communist position in the Winter 2003 issue of Proletarian Revolution (No. 66), we came under attack for allegedly calling for a revived draft.
The attackers include not only the fake-Trotskyist Spartacist League, for whom lying is habitual, but also the Detroit-based Communist Voice group, which descends from the Stalinist tradition that has its own notorious devotion to fabrication. Last May, Tim Hall wrote on its website that the Conyers-Rangel bill introduced in Congress in January calling for re-instating the draft had “received acceptance from a direction that will surprise many people—from the left, from a Trotskyist organization, the League for a Revolutionary Party.”
Misstating our name is one thing; butchering the truth is another. In fact, the very first sentence Hall quotes from PR says exactly the opposite of what he charges: “As revolutionary Marxists, we oppose all bourgeois armies, conscripted or mercenary.” To be specific, we are flat-out opposed to any support whatever to the capitalist military machine, drafted or volunteer, Conyers-Rangel or not. However, for anyone seriously interested in destroying that machine, opposition is only the beginning of the discussion over how to reach that goal. 
“No Draft” Is No Answer
We are for a workers’ militia, an army totally independent of and opposed to the capitalist state. Our policy towards the bourgeois military is to seek to split it, to turn its base against the top, to turn imperialist wars into civil class wars, and out of that conflict forge the workers’ red army. We learned that from Lenin and Trotsky.
But it is ABC for Marxists that as long as the working class does not overthrow the bourgeoisie, state power will remain capitalist—and no state can exist without armed power. There is no way, except in pacifist fantasy, to eliminate the bourgeois military as a whole without overthrowing the bourgeois state itself through revolutionary class struggle. Within that context, any campaign against the draft represents a demand on the capitalist state to maintain a professional, mercenary army, since that is its only alternative. That is why we say ” ‘No Draft’ Is No Answer.” 
A mercenary, “voluntary,” army provides long-term military training to those who choose to be professional soldiers. They are trained as an elite corps of thugs, in many respects effectively a police department that can be used against masses abroad as well as at home. On the other hand, a drafted army is more susceptible to the moods and attitudes of the masses and is more accessible to revolutionary propaganda and agitation. Over time, the class distinctions between the “grunts” and the officer corps in conscripted armies become sharper, and the discontent of the working class ranks accelerates. Further, a drafted army allows all workers to receive essential military training, which is absolutely crucial for the success of socialist revolution. 
For these reasons, as long as some kind of bourgeois military is unavoidable, revolutionaries prefer a drafted army to a mercenary army. So while we in no way support the bourgeois draft and would never vote for one or call for its resumption, we argue against campaigns that oppose resumption of the draft. We also argue against those who advocate refusing to enter the draft, should it be resumed. As genuine communists have always done, we go with our fellow workers when they are conscripted. We call on all would-be revolutionaries to join us in the military if they are drafted and work within it to win other recruits to the revolutionary cause.
Hall’s accusation that we support the Conyers/Rangel proposal is thoroughly dishonest. In the PR 66 article that Hall attacks, we clearly described the real motivation for the Conyers/Rangel proposal: “In reality, like other ‘anti-war’ Democratic politicians, Rangel wants to carry out imperialist policies with a better cover.” We pointed out that Congressman Rangel tried to out-tough Bush on the need for a strong military; we quoted him as saying, “The administration has yet to address the question of whether our military is of sufficient strength and size to meet present and future commitments.”
We can add that Rangel claimed that those who rule will be more careful about launching wars if their children are to be drafted. That is sheer demagogy. Bourgeois drafts do not mean universal conscription: they allow millions of exemptions, officer posts and alternate service channels for ruling-class and often middle-class youth. These escapes are not available to young workers, especially those of color. Our propaganda has always exposed this fact. So much for our “acceptance” of Rangel’s call for a draft!
Lenin on Militarism: “Full Speed Ahead!”
Hall has to make a hash of Lenin’s position in order to attack ours. (He thankfully ignores Trotsky, because he does “not consider Trotskyism a revolutionary theory.") Ignorantly labeling Lenin “a most determinedly anti-militarist revolutionary,” Hall tries to obscure the fact that Lenin time and again warmly welcomed the inevitable militarization of the masses because it advances the capacity of the workers to overthrow capitalism! 
In our pamphlet ’No Draft’ Is No Answer!, and in the article Marxism and the Draft in  Socialist Voice No. 9, we published extended citations from the major Marxist thinkers on militarism and the draft. For example, Engels wrote:
The more workers who are trained in the use of weapons, the better. Universal conscription is the necessary and natural extension of universal suffrage; it enables the electorate to carry out its resolutions arms in hand... .
The ever more complete introduction of military service is the only aspect of the Prussian army reorganization which interests the German working class. (The Prussian Military Question and the German Workers’ Party, 1865.)
Lenin spelled it out in his article, The Military Program of the Proletarian Revolution:
The bourgeoisie makes it its business to promote trusts, drive women and children into the factories, subject them to corruption and suffering, condemn them to extreme poverty. We do not “demand” such development, we do not “support” it. We fight it. But how do we fight? We explain that trusts and the employment of women in industry are progressive. We do not want a return to the handicraft system, domestic drudgery for women. Forward through the trusts, etc., and beyond them to socialism!
With the necessary changes that argument is applicable also to the present militarization of the population. Today the imperialist bourgeoisie militarizes the youth as well as the adults; tomorrow, it may begin militarizing the women. Our attitude should be: All the better! Full speed ahead! For the faster we move, the nearer shall we be to the armed uprising against capitalism.
Further on Lenin says:
The women of an oppressed and really revolutionary class ... will say to their sons: “You will soon be grown up. You will be given a gun. Take it and learn the military art properly. The proletarians need this knowledge not to shoot your brothers, the workers of other countries, as it is being done in the present war, and as the traitors to socialism are telling you to do. They need it to fight the bourgeoisie of their own country, to put an end to exploitation, poverty and war, and not by pious wishes, but by defeating and disarming the bourgeoisie.”
And those quotations are just a sample.
In contrast to all this evidence, Hall tries to show that Lenin was in favor of campaigning against the draft by dredging up one isolated quote from a lecture that Lenin gave in May 1917: “It is difficult to conceive them [the American people] standing for compulsory military service, for the setting up of an army pursuing any aims of conquest.” But Lenin was just commenting here that the American bourgeoisie was aiming to change this mood by entering World War I: “The American capitalists have stepped into this war in order to have an excuse, behind a smokescreen of lofty ideals, for building up a strong standing army.” (War and Revolution in Collected Works, v. 24, p. 417.)
Lenin’s 1917 lecture was not about tactics and strategy for revolutionaries in relation to the military in general. It was about the character of the imperialist war and the broad nature of the revolutionary situations that would result from the war. It was also a product of a highly specific context. Marx had speculated that the United States in the 19th century, like very few other countries, might not need a violent revolution, in part due to its lack of a standing military machine. That was Lenin’s context. Can anyone seriously claiming to be a revolutionary contend that such a reference applies to the U.S. today?
Hall sucks out of his thumb the notion that this one sentence proves that Lenin was “a staunch opponent of conscription for the reactionary bourgeois military machine.” It doesn’t prove that at all, if Hall means that Lenin ever called for a protest against conscription. What it shows is Lenin’s general opposition to the imperialist military machine, conscripted or otherwise, in the American context. His fundamental outlook was expressed by his “Full speed ahead!” in relation to the bourgeoisie’s wartime militarization of the population; that is incompatible with campaigning against the draft.
In another 1917 speech, in June, Lenin saluted the fraternization that was taking place between “enemy” Russian and German soldiers at the front: 
We must make fraternization conscious, we must see that it is transferred into an exchange of ideas, that it is carried over to the other fronts, that it kindles a revolution on the other side of the trenches. (Collected Works, v. 41, p. 437.)
A newspaper reported that he was asked whether workers should refuse to be drafted and sent to the front. (The Russian bourgeois government was drafting Bolshevik workers for that purpose.) Referring to Karl Liebknecht, the German communist leader who had himself been drafted, Lenin said:
Under the Tsarist power we had to go into the army and work there. Liebknecht put on a uniform to conduct agitation against the war. It is naive to think that the war can be abolished by separate anarchic action.
Hall just can’t get it that Lenin opposed the draft only in the sense that he opposed the entire bourgeois military. Yet later in his contradictory article, Hall observes that “Lenin said the workers should not recoil in horror at compulsory military service but should utilize it to acquire military training that will help them overthrow the bourgeoisie.” If Hall really understands that Lenin held this view, then why denounce the LRP for saying the same thing? It looks like CV’s leftover Stalinism has blinded them to the fact that Trotskyists are not only the authentic revolutionaries but are also dedicated to telling the truth about Lenin.
The Anti-Vietnam War Movement
The rest of Hall’s argument consists of painting the anti-war movement of the 1960’s and early 1970’s as if the anti-draft actions were the height of the movement’s militancy and most conscious anti-imperialism. He falls into calling the anti-war movement the “anti-draft movement” and glorifies the tendency to focus on middle-class anti-authority issues. And he totally ignores the fact that because of its class leadership it was incapable of mobilizing the industrial working class, the only force in the U.S. that can end all imperialist wars.
Citing the trend towards greater militancy among youthful demonstrators, Hall claims that opposition to the draft was the key. It is true that the movement often focused on the draft as a symbol of the war and that many advocated and practiced draft resistance. But the defining character of the anti-war movement remained its opposition to the war itself, not just to the draft. And the increased militancy Hall associates with the anti-draft momentum did not have the revolutionary content Hall imagines. Let us put the anti-war movement in its context. The force that really compelled the U.S. to pull out of the war was the massive struggle of the Vietnamese people against imperialism. At home, the ruling class faced powerful ghetto revolts and, by the 1970’s, a plunging economy and massive industrial wildcat strike wave. In relative isolation from these upheavals, the middle-class-led anti-war movement played a role, but not the decisive one. 
Further, by politically limiting its goals to those acceptable to the liberal bourgeois Democratic Party officials, the anti-war demonstrators allowed the ruling class to get out of a losing and damaging war with the imperialist system left limping but essentially intact. We are paying the price for that today, Hall’s retrospective celebration aside. 
Tragically, the leading role in policing the anti-war movement was played by various pseudo-revolutionary socialist organizations. These outfits detoured the militants whom they attracted into acting to ensure the liberal flavor of the movement. Hall is a latter day reflection of that disastrous “socialist” course. 
Pacifism and Class Divisions
The pacifist viewpoint stresses the horror of universal military training (which Lenin urged workers not to recoil from, as Hall acknowledges). But for Hall, as for much of the student left in the 1960’s, breaking with pacifism simply means adopting macho tactics in the street. Confrontationism doesn’t break with the fundamental assumptions of the pacifists, expressed in the demands to end the draft so that “we” won’t be tainted with militarism. The militant tactics were merely stronger gestures disguising a fundamentally moralistic outlook not much different from that of the pacifists who insist on civil disobedience. That is why Lenin condemned even the militant social pacifists with as much anger as he condemned the overtly pro-war social patriots.
When the anti-war movement focused on the draft as the main issue, it was weakened politically. Aiming at the draft re-enforced the barrier between the middle-class anti-war activists and the workers, who as the war dragged on shed their illusions in the imperialist cause.
Most working-class youth who were drafted saw no other option. In the beginning of the war, patriotism spurred their acceptance. That soon wore off as reality set in, but young workers saw no alternative. The draft protesters were often seen by working-class draftees and their families as incomprehensibly naive or spoiled and cowardly rich brats. Those who concentrated on draft dodging deepened the gap. The anti-draft program pointed to no way out, had no content relevant to workers and was therefore not revolutionary.
As the war went on, working-class opposition to the war became more and more massive. It was greater among Black workers but also grew rapidly among white workers. But it did not translate into significantly greater identification with the anti-war protests for the reasons given.
The growing confrontationism in the anti-war movement did indeed reflect increased radical sentiments. Unfortunately, since there was no decisive class schism within the struggle, the greater militancy and confrontations on the street, which Hall regards as pro-revolutionary, were motivated by increasing frustration and desperation. The war went on and on, while the big protest demonstrations, featuring endless empty speeches by liberal politicians, led nowhere. But the street clashes were no threat to imperialism either, even though they were more satisfying than passive parades. Contradictory though it may sound, the anti-draft activists who furiously confronted cops in the streets were fundamentally enraged pacifists caught in another dead end.
Industrial Workers Were Key
What could have shaken the imperialist state would have been massive industrial strikes against the war and a conscious struggle against the war within the army. The latter did occur, as we described in our article, Vietnam: the ‘Working-Class War’, in  PR 45. As for industrial action, that too occurred and had an important impact, but it did not match the anti-imperialist potential inherent in the working-class explosion that was being generated at the time.
In addition to their pro-liberal work in the anti-war protests, the phony socialist organizations attracted many students, including some who were sent into the factories to join the working class. These would-be revolutionaries constituted an important force, given the restive climate among workers. They mainly pretended to be mere rank and filists and pushed militant economic demands; thus, under the cover of radical rhetoric, they tailed the efforts of the labor bureaucracy to localize rather than generalize the explosive strikes that broke out at the time. 
Many of the strikes were led by Black workers who did see broad social issues as integral to their struggles. But in general the “socialists” did not fight for mass working-class action consciously aimed at stopping imperialism and its war. And, very “practically,” they failed to propagandize for socialist revolution as the only real answer to the crimes of capitalism against workers everywhere.
If the “reds” had acted as authentic proletarian reds, they could have fought to convince militant sectors of the working class that the capitalists they were rebelling against were the same rulers who were conducting the war. They could have fought for a general strike against the attack on the workers at home and the imperialist war abroad. Had such a strike broken out, it would not only have accelerated revolutionary consciousness among workers; it would have forced many in the middle-class movements to recognize the power of the working class and the need for it to lead the struggle. It would have given a class definition to the rising anger of the ranks of soldiers. And it would have at least posed the question of revolution—which class should rule.
In counterposition to this strategy, Hall argues that the anti-draft middle-class students should have led the workers in uniform. Hall claims that the growth of the anti-draft movement increasingly affected the troops and that opposition to the draft raised the appeal of anti-war agitation among drafted soldiers. There was some serious work of this type, but Hall poses the class relation backwards. To the extent that workers in uniform looked to the anti-draft proponents, if Hall was really a Leninist and not a middle-class social pacifist himself he would argue that the class relationship should have been turned upside-down.
As for opposition to the war in the military, the resentment expressed by “fragging”—soldiers turning their weapons on their own officers—was of far greater importance. The problem was that while this resentment was working-class based, the soldiers were not conscious of that fact.
Even if Hall’s picture were true, what was the aim of the agitation he touts? For the most part the central message was that soldiers should desert. This could not have been seen by working-class soldiers as a realistic option. Only a small minority chose desertion, often with disastrous results individually. It would have been far better for revolutionaries to submit to the draft and carry out work within the military, not to induce individual soldiers to desert but to build a movement in the army to oppose the war and to turn the soldiers’ military training against the rulers who drafted them! As the war dragged on, the field became more and more fertile.
Black Soldiers and the Draft
Hall also tries to pose the militant draft resisters as a pole of attraction to Black revolutionaries. Referring to the militant confrontations in Oakland during the “Stop the Draft Week” in October 1967, Hall writes, “Actions like these encouraged Black revolutionaries like Malcolm X to see revolutionary forces in white America, undermining the narrow nationalism which justifies itself by claiming the isolation of the Black liberation struggle.” More thumb sucking rather than a serious investigation of the actual relationship: Malcolm X had been assassinated in February 1965. 
In fact, some politically militant Black youth were attracted by the anti-draft activists. But far more working-class Black draftees looked with disdain on the white middle-class draft evaders. Of course, the most famous draft resister of all was Muhammad Ali, but he was exceptional in more ways than one.
What about the masses of Black soldiers drafted to Vietnam? Hall refers to Black militants at home and the impression on them that anti-draft activists might have made, but he says nothing about Black men drafted to Vietnam, who totaled well over 100,000. For working-class Blacks, as for most white workers, evading the draft was not a conceivable choice. The social horizons of the middle class and the strings that it can pull are different than those allowed the working class.
Warning: Militarization Ahead
As the world crisis develops, sooner or later there will be a growing movement towards war between the advanced imperialist powers. Already the Pentagon is saying it needs more soldiers and longer tours of duty in Iraq. This points to an inevitable intensification in the militarization of the masses.
Today the American bourgeoisie prefers a makeshift voluntary professional-hybrid army incorporating highly trained specialists employing advanced technology. The core of the army is the professional mercenaries, the “lifers.” However, the increased imperialist ventures abroad have already compelled the state to recruit a broader range of volunteers. It has already had to supplement regular army troops with reservists and national guard forces. 
The military recruitment policies were deliberately designed to attract young workers who were looking not to fight abroad but to gain skills and move upward within the civilian work force. Given the recent high unemployment, this has been temporarily successful. But as Iraq demonstrates, the broadening of the army’s base has already resulted in a significant rise in discontent within the ranks. So there is little interest now in a far broader army that would be obtained through a renewed draft. 
But the time will come when the ruling class will be forced to turn to a drafted mass army, because expanded wars, conquest and occupation require massive numbers of troops. This is why these issues are extremely important for workers to consider now, even though there is no draft on the horizon at the moment.
The key to building a working-class anti-war movement is to link opposition to a given war to defense of the working class. Pacifism and draft resistance are strategies that have always been rejected by the working class in practice. Proletarian communists advocate that revolutionary workers go to war with their class brothers and sisters and take the only possible course for defending our class: as Lenin stressed, we must turn the imperialist war into a class war. 
To this end, revolutionaries help their fellow soldiers understand the class nature of the army and the imperialist nature of the war. When tactically possible, we raise, for example, the demand that the officers should be chosen by the soldiers themselves, so that workers are not turned into cannon fodder by racist, incompetent and anti-working-class officers. We fight for full political and union rights for soldiers. We oppose class privileges for bourgeois youth: no student deferments, no special officers’ academies, no ROTC. We show that military training and arms are essential tools for building a workers’ militia at home that can defend strikes and working-class communities against cops, scabs, thugs and fascists—and can be turned into a weapon for proletarian revolution and the end to imperialist wars.

Stalinist Expansion, the Fourth International and the Working Class

Proletarian Revolution No. 64 (Spring 2002)
 Transcribed, Edited and Formatted by Damon Maxwell and David Walters in 2008 for the Encyclopedia of Trotskyism On-Line.

  
 
In the late 1940’s and early 1950’s, the Fourth International (FI) made a great leap backward, a major step in its collapse as the world communist revolutionary vanguard. After years of understanding that the post-World War II expansion of Stalinism into East Europe had developed state capitalist regimes there, the FI suddenly declared these nations to instead be “deformed workers’ states.” The term “deformed” was used instead of “degenerated,” because nobody could pretend that these states had ever been revolutionary workers’ states. Thus, with the stroke of a pen, an organization which claimed the unstained banner of Trotskyism, turned the fundamental principles of the Marxist world view into their opposites. 
In the course of the FI discussion on East Europe, James P. Cannon, the leader of the Socialist Workers Party of the U.S., pointed out in 1949: 
I don’t think you can change the class character of the state by manipulations at the top. It can only be done by a revolution which is followed by a revolution in fundamental property  relations. ... If you once begin to play with the idea that the class nature of the state can be changed by manipulations in top circles, you open the door to all kinds of revisions of basic theory. (SWP Internal Bulletin , October 1949.)
Soon Cannon, like Michel Pablo, Ernest Mandel, Gerry Healy, Nahuel Moreno and the other leaders of the FI not only opened this door, they broke it down. Nevertheless, Cannon had been right in pointing to the extensive revisionist consequences of the new “deformed workers’ state” theory. Among those Marxist fundamentals which had been necessary to revise were: 
1. That only the working class can make the socialist revolution, i.e., establish a proletarian dictatorship, a workers' state.  
2. That socialist revolution can only occur when the proletariat is led by its most conscious advanced sector, organized into a Bolshevik-Leninist vanguard party. Proletarian class consciousness is the key element.
3. That Stalinism constituted an alien and counterrevolutionary invasion force within the working-class movement. By 1940, the Stalinist bureaucracy had become, in Trotsky’s words, an “absolute obstacle in the path of the country’s development” and an imperialist tool. Its murderous struggle against Trotskyism was designed to prevent socialist revolutions, not to lead them.
4. That Popular Fronts are class-collaborationist blocs created to prevent socialist revolution, not aid and abet it.
5. That the bourgeois state apparatus must be destroyed by an actual revolution (a civil war by the working class against the capitalist class) rather than reformed or manipulated at the top—if a workers’ state is to be created.
6. That the purpose of Marxist theory and analysis is to broadly predict developments in the class struggle and thereby guide “the line of march” for our class, the proletariat. Its aim is not to serve as a retrospective rationalization for tailism; especially with an analysis which lacks any predictive capability.
At the close of World War II in 1944-5, the Soviet army marched into Eastern Europe and dominated most of the new governments set up by the Stalinists. In country after country, the masses rose up as the Nazi German occupation forces were weakened and in retreat. In several countries, workers’ councils and soldiers’ councils raised the red flag of revolution. All such workers’ uprisings were crushed by the Soviet armies—except in Poland, where the Russian divisions halted their advance in order to allow the Nazis to destroy the rebellion.
Stalin then moved to organize the new regimes as “Peoples’ Democracies.” These Popular Front governments were rotten blocs: servants of the previous pro-Nazi regimes, outright fascists, pogromists, old counterrevolutionary military figures, liberal bourgeois, social democrats, even a king—in addition to indigenous Stalinist Communist Party members. And the ranks of the CPs themselves had been swelled by the admission of large forces from the fascists like the Romanian Iron Guard.
Years before, Trotsky had predicted that the bourgeoisie would never engage in full nationalization of the means of production, even though he thought it theoretically possible. The capitalists, he wrote, would be too frightened of the opportunity that statified property would present for seizure by the working class. Thus before the People's Democracies could transform their economies according to the Soviet model, the Stalinists had to first behead and smash the proletarian forces.
In 1947 the leading FI theoretician, Ernest Mandel, summed up the events: “The bureaucracy in general began by curbing and breaking the revolutionary upsurge of the masses. A year and a half later, however, the situation in these countries is marked by a more or less widespread introduction of agrarian reforms and nationalization of heavy industry.” [“The Soviet Union After the War,” IIB, March 1947.] Mandel denied that nationalization signified anything more than private capital's inability to run these economies. He labeled as "absurd" any idea that workers' states, degenerated or not, could arise without proletarian revolutions. 
Extensive sectors of these economies had already been nationalized during the Nazi occupations. The process was continued over the next years until nationalization was nearly complete by 1948 and the Stalinists had ejected most of their coalition partners. The decapitated and demoralized working class played no role in these events, except in Czechoslovakia where there were police-dominated and staged events which gave formal agreement to the changes made at the top.
The new regimes in Yugoslavia and Albania had been created by indigenous Stalinist guerrillaist forces. However, they were just as intent as the Soviet dominated governments on preventing any proletarian upsurge. In 1948, when Tito broke with Moscow, the first reaction of the FI was to support Yugoslavia, which it still regarded as state capitalist, against the Soviet Union, which it still considered a “degenerated workers’ state.” This absurdity was soon resolved by a further one; a retrospective declaration that four years before, there had been a “socialist revolution” in Yugoslavia. Of course, when Tito’s “workers’ state” supported Western imperialism in the Korean War, this proved even more embarrassing than when he ignored the Pabloite FI’s embarrassing and indeed criminal offer for Tito to join the FI.
By 1951, the FI declared all of the Peoples' Democracies to be “deformed workers’ states,” even though neither the workers nor even the Stalinist rulers considered them anything of the kind. The degenerating FI could never resolve the question of precisely when these states had become “workers’ states.” If the date of the social transformation was 1947-48, then the transformation from popular frontist capitalism to workers’ state was made without a revolution and without the smashing of the state apparatus. After all, the Soviet Army and the Stalinists held effective power both before and after the peaceful change.
On the other hand, if the date was set at 1944-5, that meant that the “socialist revolution” had occurred at the very moment that the Soviet armies were crushing the workers’ struggles. Further, if these armies created socialist revolutions by their occupation, how could eastern Austria and Finland revert to capitalism without a violent counterrevolution when Russian control ended in those countries? 
Neither scenario can answer the fundamental question of how the socialist revolution could be accomplished without leadership by the proletariat, spearheaded by its conscious vanguard. The whole structure of the Marxist world view is rooted in the understanding that the working class is the sole agency of the socialist revolution.
“Orthodoxy” is anathema for genuine Marxists. The factional struggles waged by the “orthodox” tendencies led at times by Cannon, Healy, Lambert, Moreno, et al, as opposed to the groups led by Pablo and Mandel, were fought over secondary questions. All sides embraced the “deformed workers’ state” rationalization that counterrevolutionaries could carry out socialist revolution. We designate them all as Pabloites after the inventor of the theory. Some decided that Stalinism was not in fact counterrevolutionary; they were the first to capitulate to the Stalinist parties at home.
One attempt to justify tossing out the proletarian essence of Marxism was to distort Trotsky’s point in the Transitional Program that under exceptional circumstances the petty bourgeoisie, including the Stalinists, might be forced to go further along the revolutionary road than they wished and break with the bourgeoisie. True enough, but nowhere does Trotsky suggest that the petty bourgeoisie could make the socialist revolution. Had Trotsky come to the conclusion that Marx had erred in believing that the working class was the only revolutionary agency, he would have devoted far more than a glancing reference to this new shattering conclusion! 
For the FI, the exceptional circumstances soon proved to be the rule. The revolutions in China, North Korea, North Vietnam and Cuba—all of which were bourgeois-democratic anti-imperialist revolutions that suppressed and decapitated the working class, were again designated as “socialist revolutions” by Trotsky’s false followers. Eventually the Pabloites called the new regimes workers' states; they disagreed among themselves over whether these “workers’ states” were deformed or healthy!
They also disagreed about the nominally anti-imperialist regimes that had taken power in Ethiopia, Angola, Mozambique, Algeria, Cambodia, South Yemen, Nicaragua, Afghanistan and Burma. Were these workers' or bourgeois states?
Another damning fact is that for the duration of all these “workers’ states,” over half a century of history, Pablo, Mandel wrote no analytic works describing the dynamics of these economies and how they worked. The “deformed workers’ state” name proved to be not a theory that helped explain reality but a rationalization.
Once the idea that proletariat was not the necessary agent for the socialist revolution became dominant in the FI, it opened the floodgates to every form of tailism toward peasant-based guerrillaism and social-democratic electoralism, in counterposition to revolutionary Bolshevism. It led some to support the Stalinists when they shot down workers, as with the Berlin Wall and in Jaruzelski’s crackdown in Poland. One of the greatest examples of the practical as well as theoretical collapse of the FI occurred over the Bolivian revolution of 1952. The Bolivian POR led by Lora capitulated to the left nationalists, and the FI as a whole supported its policy. For us this event marked the end of the Fourth International as a revolutionary organization.
Today, the various tendencies who believe that the collapse of Stalinism in the East has led to the creation of bourgeois states cannot explain how counterrevolution occurred without the smashing of the workers' state apparatuses and without civil war. The same state police agencies which once defended nationalized property today defend private property. 
In Proletarian Revolution  magazine and in our book The Life and Death of Stalinism , the LRP/COFI has developed the point of view that the Stalinist counterrevolution had finally succeeded in overthrowing the degenerated workers’ state in the Soviet Union by the end of the 1930'’s. Like Trotsky, we saw the Great Purge as a “civil war.” He thought the slaughter of the old Bolsheviks was a violent and desperate last resort of the Stalinist Bonapartist caste, trying to keep control over the fragile remains of a “hollow workers’ state” which could not outlast the coming world war. In contrast, we see these counterrevolutionary events as the final blow in the restoration of capitalism on a statified basis; the elimination of the last representatives of October in the state and party apparatus and the consolidation of the Stalinists as a ruling class, a regent class for the missing bourgeoisie.
Unable to fully destroy proletarian property forms and other gains of the October revolution, the Stalinist USSR was fragile compared to U.S. imperialism, but far stronger than Trotsky believed. His predicted collapse of the USSR not only did not occur, but the USSR rapidly expanded its area of rule in the wake of the world war.
As opposed to the degenerated “Fourth International,” we have no problem in explaining the Stalinist transformations in a Marxist manner; they were political but not social transformations within capitalism. We believe that our analysis reflects the outlook of authentic Trotskyism, despite our difference with Trotsky as to the rapidity of the collapse of the Soviet workers’ state. We were also able to use our theory to foresee, as early as the mid-1970's, the Stalinists’ inevitable turn to openly bourgeois methods of exploitation by wiping out the surviving gains of the workers’ revolution.
We in the COFI have begun to seriously study the literature of the POR and the LBI. Our obvious disagreements concern the nature of the Stalinist USSR, the deformed workers' states and the class nature of the police under capitalism. But there are also very important points of agreement, such as the trenchant criticisms of the capitulations of the FI made by these comrades. So far, however, we have not seen a class analysis of the collapse of the Fourth International. Trotsky pointed out, in the faction fight against the petty bourgeois Shachtmanites in 1939-40, that every important split in the Marxist movement is not simply the result of bad ideas and wrong leaders; they reflect class differences at concrete turning points in history.
We believe that the Pabloites in the West saw the Stalinist transformations in the East as progressive because their class position at home was changing. The growing post-war prosperity and the huge expansion of the middle-class intelligentsia and labor aristocracy led to a new political world view. The reformist social democratic, labor and Stalinist parties in the West, understood by Trotsky to be counterrevolutionary, were now deemed moderately progressive “blunt instruments” that could be pressured to work in the interest of the proletariat rather than the bourgeoisie. That is, social chauvinist parties were now seen as stepping stones to socialism. Shachtmanites, Cliffites and Pabloites of all sorts entered these parties, not as Trotskyists to break the ranks from the misleaders, but with illusions in the reformists. Others embraced the middle-class-led guerrillaists. The once-revolutionary parties of the FI became prisoners of the rising new “progressive” middle strata; their tailism of Stalinism in the East reflected capitulations at home.
Today, the various petty-bourgeois Pabloite tendencies even acknowledge that they believe that the proletariat itself cannot achieve revolutionary consciousness. This is directly counterposed to Lenin’s view as it evolved after 1903 and to Trotsky’s very explicit statements on this most vital question. Those of us who are fighting to re-create the authentic, revolutionary anti-imperialist Fourth International must recognize that our struggle is not simply against false theories but a crucial front in the proletarian class war, the driving force of Marxism.



Pat Buchanan’s right-wing magazine, The American Conservative, strongly opposed the U.S. war on Iraq. In its April 7 issue, Martin Sieff, the Chief International Analyst for United Press International, wrote an article entitled “That 1914 Feeling.” Sieff pointed out that Germany’s ally, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, suffered a terrorist attack when Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in 1914. The Austro-Hungarian rulers launched a war on Serbia, a “rogue state,” a response which in Sieff’s opinion failed to take into account its consequences. He recounts a conversation in a cafÃ© between Count Berchtold, the foreign minister, and a friend who was appalled that the attack would lead to a far wider war, destruction of the empire and communist revolutions.
Sieff’s article pulls no punches in expressing the fears held by the American far right that a similar disaster awaits the U.S. as a result of the current Iraq war.
He quotes Berchtold as saying to his friend, “And who will lead this terrible revolution of yours? Mr. Bronstein, I suppose, sitting over there, endlessly arguing as usual with his friends!” Sieff then comments, “Mr. Bronstein became better known to the world as Leon Trotsky, right-hand man to Vladimir Ilyich Lenin and the future creator of the Red Army.”
On August 25, 1939, a few days before World War II broke out, Hitler and Coulandre, the French ambassador to Germany, had a frank exchange. In discussing the coming war, Coulandre said “I would also have the fear that as a result of the war, there will be only one real victor—Mr. Trotsky.” Hitler then shouted, “Why do you then give Poland a blank check?”
Trotsky commented that the use of his name—the name most often reviled by the Stalinists in the Kremlin at the time—merely symbolized all their fears of socialist revolution as a result of the coming war.
Trotsky’s Specter Today
The various counterrevolutionaries today, including the Buchananites, have good reason to be frightened of imperialist adventures which can help ignite revolution. Imperialism was only saved after World War I by the treachery of social democracy, which betrayed the socialist revolutions that broke out in the wake of the Russian Bolshevik Revolution. Isolated, the revolution was finally strangled. Likewise, the Stalinist counterrevolution in the USSR succeeded in undermining and helping to crush the workers’ revolutions that exploded at the end of World War II.   
As a result of those betrayals, class consciousness among workers around the world is far less advanced today. Berchtold, Hitler and Coulandre all knew that organized 
revolutionary parties were small when their wars broke out, but they also knew enough to fear their potential leadership of the masses. The forces of authentic revolutionary working-class Trotskyism, embodied today in COFI, are growing but are much smaller and more isolated than at the outbreak of the past wars.
The international working class is objectively far stronger than it was at the outbreak of the two world wars; and for Marxists, the objective potential is key. The massive struggles now being launched in response to the general capitalist attack and the war will inevitably become the seedbed for a rapid growth in revolutionary proletarian consciousness. The continuing collapse of the counterrevolutionary reformist misleaderships within our class, both Stalinist and social-democratic, is a huge advantage compared to the past. 
Further, although the Iraq War is a clear omen of World War III, the next huge inter-imperialist war will break out not tomorrow but the day after. And fascism has not yet become a decisive force on the world scene. The fight for proletarian revolution and the Trotskyist party which champions it still has time to prevent the world disaster that U.S. imperialism is now sparking.

Centrality of the Revolutionary Party
by Sy Landy
Over the last twenty years, working-class struggles in the United States have drastically declined. The industrial battles of the late ‘60’s and early ‘70’s were diverted by the union bureaucracy into electoral support for the bourgeois Democrats. It is no accident that the centrist left, which inveterately hails and tails “militancy,” tailed it backwards and capitulated in reverse gear.
Naturally the centrists blame the workers for the “downturn” or for the class’s failure to “intersect” with middle-class saviors. The same conditions swept down on us. But tides can be overcome: alone on the far left we stood out against the current of the times. Nevertheless, we made mistakes. The LRP leadership must take responsibility for a certain retreat on the centrality of the revolutionary party.
Leon Trotsky once wrote:
[The] masses undergo their own experiences that permit them to choose and to progress along the revolutionary road, but on condition that they find a vanguard that, at every stage of the struggle, explains the situation to them, shows them the objectives to be obtained, the methods to use and the ultimate perspectives. (Writings 1933-34, p. 292.)
From the start of our existence as a political tendency, it has been our most firmly held belief that the success of the class struggle is tied to the re-creation of the revolutionary vanguard party of the proletariat. In our first days we not only reprinted Trotsky’s words above; we elaborated on the idea in article after article as well as in our practice.
We knew through bitter experience that the task of building the party could not be accomplished on a layaway plan. The Leninist party cannot first be put together at the point when revolution becomes possible. The party-building organization is vital at every point in the struggle if communist class consciousness is to develop. Without that consciousness, no proletarian revolution could be successful.
This understanding was so central to our views that we called ourselves the “League for the Revolutionary Party.” Yet we now realize that we have made an error in some of our propaganda on the necessity for the party—an error which, while limited, did hamper our work. Therefore it is important for us to identify the error, understand why it was made, correct the cause as far as possible as well as the problem—and then, so fortified, move on with our work.
At the Start of the League
Our political tendency was originally formed within the Revolutionary Socialist League, when we warned that organization that it was on the road toward betrayal of its Trotskyist program. The RSL refused to listen and instead expelled us. It betrayed. It shattered. It died.
In June of 1975, I wrote a document for the RSL internal bulletin entitled Labor Party, General Strike Proposal which was a stepping-stone to the formation of our tendency. It advocated dropping the fight for a labor party in the United States in favor of a propaganda struggle for a general strike. The RSL had not yet rid itself of the need to make the idea of creating a labor party a centerpiece of its program. This was one indication that the RSL had not abandoned all vestiges of centrism—revolution in rhetoric, reformism in practice—which so totally dominates all other groups claiming a Trotskyist heritage.
In the late 1930’s, as well as at other times in the history of the American class struggle, the slogan of a labor party did not inevitably signify a desire for a reformist party led by union bureaucrats. At points where unionized workers are very militant but have real illusions in their counterrevolutionary reformist and liberal misleaders, the idea of raising class independence and combativity from the industrial level to the political plane can expose these bureaucrats. It can open a major road toward the creation of the mass revolutionary party, if the organized advanced workers openly champion this direction and fight against the reformists’ electoral detour.
The document pointed to the mechanistic error involved in making what once was a correct tactical demand into a permanent strategy, spelling out its anti-revolutionary consequences. By the 1970’s, it was already clear that whatever illusions workers still held in the union bureaucracy, they didn’t include expectations of political or even industrial militancy and class independence from them. Challenges that the union tops form a labor party could expose nothing; they would rather reveal that the leftists had more illusions in the bureaucrats than did the ranks. Given the setbacks suffered by workers, what was necessary was hardly passive electoralism but a convincing and self-convincing demonstration of power, the general strike.
Additionally, the article pointed out that the general strike demand by itself did not totally solve the critical problem of the revolutionary party. It warned:
We have failed to, in the past, adequately stress the revolutionary party content we must place into the Labor Party demand. Frequently, we have seemed to pose the Labor Party as the real solution and the revolutionary organization as simply a desirable ginger group for its attainment. Obviously and crucially we must exercise care not to fall into the same trap with the General Strike demand.
Yet despite our early self-warning, we walked into the same trap. We only caught a toe or two, but given the importance we attach to the issue, it has been bad enough. Too many times for comfort, we in the LRP permitted ourselves to appear as a militant pressure group fighting for the general strike, letting that struggle overshadow our fundamental purpose for existence, party-building.
In our self-conception, in much of our general propaganda and practical activities, we unambiguously maintained the fight for the party as central. In our theoretical work we never retreated on our gains in this crucial area. This helped us overlook the fact that too often, in our trade union work and the propaganda associated with it, stress on the iron necessity to build the party was subordinated to promoting the general strike.
Subordinating the Party Question
Let us cite only one small instance to illustrate an unfortunately more extensive misuse. The Proletarian Revolution Supplement No. 6 of Feb.-March 1986 carried an article “Transit Union Brakes Struggles.” In the next-to-last paragraph it noted: “A revolutionary leadership would make an appeal to all the unions and workers in New York for a general strike against union busting and concessions.” That was the only place in the article where revolutionary leadership was mentioned, and it was cited only as a group fighting for a general strike.
This particular reference to revolutionary leadership was not typical of our articles that downgraded the party. However, it was atypical only in that we more commonly referred to “revolutionary party leadership,” and we often reserved the comment for the last paragraph rather than the preceding one. In other words, we just tacked it on.
So what? Why is this error so important?
For one thing, our looseness led us to overlook for too long the increasingly open and generalized anti-party positions held by the former leader of our Australian affiliate. (See Paul White Betrays Revolutionary Politics in this issue.)
But its real importance lies in the fact that our mistake touched on fundamentals: this is the epoch of capitalism’s decay—the era of revolution and counterrevolution, imperialism, world war and the transition to socialism. In this epoch, the fundamental crisis is the crisis of working-class leadership. Capitalism, with all its characteristic inhuman brutality, has created an economically interdependent world. It has matured and socialized the forces of production so that for the first time in human history the potential already exists to eliminate scarcity and therefore class society. Objectively, the most important productive force, the working class, is certainly big enough, concentrated enough and powerful enough to overthrow capitalism and take state power. And, generally speaking, throughout this century, the workers have risen up in strikes, general strikes, riots, rebellions, revolts and revolutions. We don’t need a new working class, we need a new leadership.
But if the LRP really believes that, what’s the difference whether we say it or not as long as we carry through on it?
Trotsky never tired of telling revolutionaries to “say what is” to the working class. A revolutionary party is the material manifestation of its program. Its program reflects its understanding of the world and how the proletariat should proceed to transform it. This understanding—this consciousness—has its origin in the workings of capitalist development itself. The system creates its own gravedigger, the working class. The key to socialist revolution is the development of consciousness by the workers as to their role and their mission. The truth enables the proletariat to set itself free—above all, the truth that it needs to form its own advanced party, the embodiment of its program, consciousness and mission.
Communist Consciousness and the Left
The working class is not homogeneous, and being composed of human beings, it learns much through experience. Communist class consciousness doesn’t occur all at once; different layers of the class advance at different times and rates. Experience can be interpreted wrongly as well as rightly. The pro-capitalist leadership forces, rewarded by the system, are hardly unwilling to misdirect.
For example, take a situation in which a union leadership is forced into a strike it doesn’t want. Fearful of going too far, it puts forward very limited demands on the company. Many workers, desperately pinching pennies, don’t support the strike because the sacrifice doesn’t seem worth the possible gain. The strike becomes endangered. Some militant workers accept the leadership’s conclusion that the strike was too radical an idea in the first place and must be given up. Some listen to those who say the strike isn’t radical enough.
The same dialogue occurs, writ large, in revolutionary situations. If the most advanced workers—the vanguard leadership—doesn’t go through all these experiences with its fellow workers, giving communist guidance, the less advanced and backward layers will not develop to full class consciousness, and the struggle will be lost.
One or two far left tendencies (for example, the International Socialists) acknowledge the working class as the source of socialist consciousness but assert that this is an automatic or spontaneous development once the class fights. Thus, these leftists believe they do not have to stress the need for revolutionary guidance: militancy will do. In contrast, all the other so-called Trotskyist organizations today assert that the intelligentsia is the deliverer of advanced consciousness—à la Lenin before he corrected himself. Their view also runs counter to Trotsky’s repeated assertions. (See  PR 29, “What Has Been Done to What Is to Be Done?".)
There is nothing wrong with disagreeing with Marx, Lenin, Trotsky or our other great teachers even on subjects where they were emphatic—we have done so ourselves—but then one has the obligation to acknowledge the difference, show why they were wrong and what bad consequences followed from their errors. Shamefully, none of the alleged Trotskyists do that. Hiding their differences follows from their basic view: if the workers are the battering rams but not the bearers of socialist ideas, they don’t have to know the truth. It is enough that their condescending saviors know. Therefore, these groups too put forward “militancy” rather than revolutionary answers.
Militancy Alone No Answer
Militancy alone will never transcend capitalism. The working class, in the form of its ever-increasing advanced layers, must be conscious of its need and ability to overthrow the system and lay the basis for a new one.
Is the answer then to downplay the general strike?
No. The general strike is as vital for the working class today as it was yesterday. We continue to put it forward, but we must correct how we do so where we have made mistakes.
The LRP is a small group. The left is now composed of small groups; we are smaller than some, bigger than others. In the long run this is not critical. Whether or not the group’s program expresses the interests of the proletariat is decisive. Only yesterday, the Communist Parties were massive compared to us.
There is a second decisive factor, reflecting the first. We are tiny compared to the mass of the working class, which doesn’t yet have communist class consciousness. Unlike phony socialists, we do not adapt to the current level of militancy and limit our effective program to demands calculated to take the working class only to the next step—after which there will be more next steps, until in the by-and-by, presto!, comes the revolution. Except that it never comes.
Aside from the manipulation and lies this method demonstrates, the idea is absurd. It is the changing character of the exploitative capitalist system that pressures the proletariat in the direction of revolution, not the goosing tactics of small groups who believe that they can maneuver the class into exploding. Talk about chutzpah!
General Strike and Revolution
The LRP knows that when the general strike breaks out, as it inevitably will, it will not be as a result of the working class listening to us—unless by that time we are far bigger and in a far more commanding position than we are today. Only on very few occasions are we in a position to agitate—to address one or two slogans to broad masses of workers in the actual expectation that they can be carried out. Rather our present task is to propagandize—to relate a complex set of revolutionary slogans and ideas to our fellow advanced workers.
That is, we speak to a relatively small but growing layer of politically interested and radicalized workers about the necessity of building the party, its strategy for revolution and the tactics which flow from it. Capitalism generates and regenerates such layers, bigger and more influential than we are at present. These are layers that we can influence—and, lately to a growing extent, actually are influencing. To them we explain that the crucial importance of the general strike is that it unifies the working class, demonstrates its power, raises consciousness and poses the question that the working class can and should rule in society. The general strike puts the question of revolution before the masses for decision, but it doesn’t answer the question. If there is not a Leninist leadership, not only will there be no revolution but even minimal class aims will be undermined.
We seek to show not only how a revolutionary leadership would act if it were at the helm of a general strike but also how vanguard workers should communicate the need for such a mass strike to layers of their fellow workers who are moving forward. Militant workers now need a general strike because they wish to defend themselves against the capitalist attacks on their jobs, pay and unions. It is a major step toward a defense of Black and Latino workers, an answer to the system’s attempt to whip up race war and divisiveness.
One crucial aspect of united working-class mass actions like the general strike is that they do not demand political agreement by the workers who participate. We can all fight together in defense of our class needs. We tell advanced workers to warn militants, as openly as we do, that if there is not revolutionary leadership created in time, the reformist leaderships will inevitably betray the strike because they do not wish even the idea of state power to be posed. They are committed to capitalism. The struggle itself will prove which is right—the militants’ present belief that their needs can be answered without overthrowing capitalism, or the communist understanding that even the most minimal defense of the working class demands revolution as the crisis of the system inexorably deepens.
In this way we fight for the general strike while emphasizing our essential task, the need for advanced workers and those who identify with their interests to join us in building the party of our class. The proletariat has suffered enough from the social engineering and lies of the middle-class “progressive” saviors.
Events That Forced Us to Rethink
Those who have read Proletarian Revolution carefully over the last few issues will see that we have already begun to correct our course. Recognition of our problem did not occur by accident. The rebellion in Los Angeles over the Rodney King beating pointed out in no uncertain terms that, at this time, challenging the present labor leadership to launch a general strike in response would expose nothing and be treated as a joke by fighting anti-racist workers. Such workers had to be reached by communist propaganda on why the party must be built now if a successful fight for a general strike to bring L.A. to a halt was to be made.
The other event which greatly affected us was the recent workers’ upheaval in Melbourne, Australia involving thousands upon thousands of union militants. We in the LRP have participated in class battles over the years, and sometimes we achieved a modest impact. In the Melbourne events, however, our Australian comrades proved that our program, strategy and tactics not only won for us the ear of the advanced workers but confirmed in practice our fundamental outlook. These massive events forced COFI as a whole to conclude that our only important shortcoming on the streets of Melbourne was in not making the party even more central than we did.
Los Angeles, Melbourne and the renewed class battles in Europe, South Africa and elsewhere herald a new day. The working classes of the world are moving toward an enormous rising which will dwarf even the titanic strikes and revolts of the late l960’s and the early 1970’s, events that created our tendency in the first place. Such a prospect forces us to re-examine our world view to arm us for the coming days of decision. Making errors is no crime; it is impossible not to make errors. The crime is to ignore them and not to learn from the experience.
Scientific Predictions
Our confidence in dealing with our errors comes in part from the record achieved by our program and our method. When almost every left tendency pointed to Stalinism in the USSR as powerful, the wave of the future for good or bad, we showed at the height of the Cold War how weak it was. We pointed out that it was doomed not simply to collapse but to try to rebuild its faltering statified capitalist economy by increasingly adapting to market forms like those of Western capitalism. Far in advance of the actual events, we predicted that this tendency toward privatization would not go the whole way before it stalled completely. We predicted not only the central role that the workers would play in the collapse of Stalinist states but warned that if their party was not built in time, fascism would loom large.
Likewise, we predicted that there was a far greater likelihood that the next world war would be fought among the U.S., Japan and Germany than between the U.S. and the USSR. Fifteen years ago, the middle-class left laughed at these ideas. Now many of them are commonplace.
But the idea that party-building has been reconfirmed as a central task will still inspire smirks, along with the snickers at the “outdated” idea that the task of freeing the proletariat is that of the proletariat itself. In the coming years, the class-conscious workers will deal with these Cheshire cats in the course of making their revolution. It is no accident today that as the left grows even more cynical and pessimistic, our optimism expands.

Amid a wave of arrests, tortures and executions of the left, Iran’s ruling Islamic Republican Party deposed the bourgeois liberal president Abolhassan Bani-Sadr in June. This completed the takeover of government offices by the IRP, a party of Moslem mullahs and laymen closely tied to the priesthood. In July, former prime minister Mohammed Ali Rajai (recently assassinated) took over the presidency in a rigged election restricted to IRP candidates.
The IRP’s move to consolidate state power represents a major defeat for the Iranian revolution that overthrew the hated Shah in February 1979. The general strike and insurrection that brought down the Shah had raised the hopes of Iranian workers and peasants for prosperity and freedom. Many put their confidence in the mullahs, notably the Ayatollah Khomeini, who had demagogically denounced U.S. imperialism and its local compradors in the Shah’s entourage, and a bourgeois Islamic republic was set up. But the masses’ continuing struggle made it impossible for the capitalists to pull together a strong regime for two years; one leader after another was denounced as a tool of imperialism and deposed, arrested or exiled.
In our  analysis  in  Socialist Voice No. 11, we anticipated that Bani-Sadr’s alliance with the army officer corps and his ties to U.S. and French imperialism would make him the chief candidate for the strongman the bourgeoisie needed. And indeed, the Bonapartist leader Khomeini, in balancing between the liberal bourgeois representative Bani-Sadr and the petty-bourgeois IRP, had leaned toward the president for some time. But Bani-Sadr’s weakness and his inability to win the war with Iraq strengthened the hand of his IRP rivals and led to his downfall.
Bani-Sadr’s weakness mirrored that of the bourgeoisie itself as the crisis in Iran deepened. It became clear to Khomeini and evidently even to the army that a firmer, more repressive hand was needed to quell internal discord and chaos. Moreover, the army-bourgeoisie combination could not produce a believable anti-imperialist facade to hold the support of the masses. So the neo-fascist IRP made its move to try to save Iranian capitalism. The IRP had progressively altered its stance to align itself more clearly in defense of capitalism while still projecting its anti-imperialist demagogy. During the course of the war the IRP had to give up the pretense that Iranian capitalism could survive without a deal with imperialism. Hence it colluded with the U.S. in a solution to the hostage seizure that completely sold out the anti-imperialist aspirations of the Iranian masses.

Mullahs Use Fascist Thugs
The clergy may have all the government posts now, but its hold on power is not secure. Terrorists have assassinated scores of leading IRP members since Bani-Sadr’s ouster. There have been several street battles between left-wing organizations and the Pasdaran (Revolutionary Guards), the government militia linked to the IRP. The Kurdish people continue to fight the central government for self-determination, and there is new unrest among the Azerbaijanis in northwest Iran. Further, the IRP’s claim of a massive turnout for their candidate in the presidential elections seems to be a lie—Iranian leftists and French journalists in Teheran believe that not more than a third of the claimed 12,000,000 actually voted.
The mullahs’ strength is based, however, not solely on votes or religious faith but on its veritable army of thugs, the Hezbollahi, or Supporters of the Party of God. These gangs have warred against the leftist parties and militant workers from the start, and had succeeded last year in carrying out an IRP campaign to “Islamicize” the universities, a left stronghold; Bani-Sadr demonstrated his impotence by doing nothing to stop the arrests, killings and university shutdowns. Now that the IRP has governmental power this harassment has become a full-scale massacre.
If the clergy succeeds in consolidating its power, it will install a fascist-like regime in Iran. Unlike the Shah, who never had any mass support (he seized power through a CIA- backed military coup), the IRP has built mass organizations to mobilize small merchants, artisans, and some workers behind it. The mullahs already had a mass base on which to build—the. Moslem congregation. Using the traditional prayer services, and setting up neighborhood committees and factory Islamic societies, as well as the Hezbollahi and Pasdaran thugs, the priests have set up the framework for the control of many aspects of daily life by the government and ruling party.
Other aspects of fascism strictly defined are easy to find—the supreme leader who seems to stand above classes is, of course, Khomeini. The Islamic judges who occasionally jail or even execute capitalists for price-gouging or ties to the U.S. stand in the fascist tradition of regimenting a capitalist class too decayed to discipline itself. The “corporatism” of the neighborhood committees, Friday prayer services, and factory Islamic Societies go together with Persian and Moslem chauvinism to enforce the “unity of all classes” against “alien influences” allegedly responsible for dividing Iranians against each other. In line with this, the massacre of the Kurds continues, along with a campaign against members of the Jewish and especially Baha’i religions which threatens to become literally genocide.

Worker’s Gains Threatened
The IRP’s triumph means that all the gains of the 1979 revolution are in danger of being erased. For the working class these include wage increases, elements of workers’ control of the factories and in certain cases factory councils (called shoras) still independent of the capitalists and the clergy. Some reports from Iran indicate that the June governmental crisis came at the time of a strike wave by workers that forced the bourgeoisie finally to move to strongman rule.
It follows from the nature of the IRP that if it does consolidate its power, the priests will turn against their own mass base. They will dissolve or purge those organizations which have any potential for mobilization independent of the clergy. They will undertake a head-on assault against the working class as a whole, not just as now against the left. As a result of the revolution, they have been forced to permit some slack, allowing for example some worker review of management decisions. Once firmly in the saddle, the IRP will move to crush all working class initiative and independence under a ruthless police dictatorship.
The imperialists recognize this too. Even though the IRP has encouraged the taking of U.S. (and more recently French) citizens in Iran hostage, these powers have continued to make profitable deals with the IRP government. They recognize the clergy’s need to take some token “anti-imperialist” actions to appease the real anti-imperialism of the Iranian workers and peasants. Leading imperialist newspapers like the New York Times openly state the need for the IRP to take all power as the only force capable of restoring “order” (i.e., imperialism) to Iran. Today, behind their anti-American rhetoric, Khomeini and the IRP are tripping all over themselves to accommodate American oil interests—as they must if they wish to regain any strength within the world market from which no “nationalist” regime can break.
The guerrilla struggle against the IRP regime has had some spectacular successes, including the killing of many leaders by bombs planted at party and state offices. Led by the Mojahedin organization closely tied to Bani-Sadr, the struggle is reportedly widely popular in Iran. But a terror campaign is no substitute for mass struggle. If the Khomeini government is so weak that it cannot consolidate the counterrevolution, and if the working class does not act in its own interest, the bourgeoisie will then look to a military dictatorship to keep the masses suppressed. This would necessitate a direct link with imperialism, with or without Bani-Sadr. The other alternative of a Bani-Sadr/Mojahedin government, in effect a popular front (with the army biding its time as in Allende’s Chile), would be only a temporary possibility but a very dangerous one for the workers.

No Support in Iran-Iraq War
In our previous analysis of Iran, we advocated a policy of military support to Iran in the war against Iraq. That meant that proletarian and communist forces would turn their guns against the immediate enemy, the Iraqi counterrevolutionaries, who were aiming through their invasion to destroy all the gains won by the Iranian masses. This policy openly specified that communists must stand for revolutionary opposition to the Khomeini regime and work for its overthrow; and in particular, we called for continued military support to the Kurdish fighters. We warned that the Khomeiniite state was plotting to destroy all the revolutionary gains and would inevitably turn its guns on the Iranian workers. We insisted upon the absolute necessity for the political independence of proletarian fighting forces and that they be armed independently of the state.
These warnings and predictions have proved correct. The IRP coup has transformed the nature of the war. The immediate enemy of the Iranian proletariat and peasantry is no longer the Iraqi rulers but their own. No temporary military bloc with the Teheran government is possible when that government is shooting first at the workers. (Of course, workers must still fight the Iraqi counterrevolutionaries as well.)
In the face of the IRP’s onslaught the Iranian left has politically collapsed. No left organization that has come to our attention has ever fought clearly for a program of socialist revolution; most followed the long-discredited Stalinist line that a bourgeois-democratic stage had to be completed before socialism reached the agenda. Accordingly, the Tudeh party and the Fedayin majority backed Khomeini’s government and now support the IRP dictatorship. On the other side, the Mojahedin gave full support to Bani-Sadr when he came under attack and now call for his return to power. Several other groups that oppose both the IRP and Bani-Sadr still refuse to advocate any program beyond “democracy,” which is just another (and, under present circumstances, utopian) way to preserve the property and power of the bourgeoisie. BaniSadrism without Bani-Sadr is no more a solution than it is with him.
There is still time to prevent the fascist victory. What is necessary is a party in Iran that fights for the working class to form shoras independent of the clergy, to arm themselves, seize the factories, call on the peasants to seize the land and overthrow the IRP. Such a party would fight for independence for Kurdistan. It would fight against all religion and superstition and would train the working class in scientific socialism, so the workers would fit themselves to run society. If the Iranian working class does not form its genuine Trotskyist party and make the socialist revolution, it will face a regime of deepest barbarism and darkness.



Introduction
The fundamental question at stake in the Iraq-Iran war, for communists, is simple: we defend revolution from counterrevolution, the gains of the working class and the oppressed from the exploiters and oppressors. Therefore, in the present war we defend the Iranian revolution from the attack upon it. In contrast to Iraq, where bourgeois rulers have succeeded in wiping out every gain from the struggles of the past, the revolution in Iran still lives.

Workers’ councils (shoras in Persian) arose during the revolution that overthrew the Shah in February 1979 and have mushroomed since. Many of them have grown independent of Ayatollah Khomeini’s Islamic regime and even hostile to it. Many local shoras control their factories and even the output and production priorities of their industries. Peasants have begun to take over the land themselves. National minorities have forced the Teheran regime to recognize some of their rights. The far left and working-class political organizations can now organize, publish and demonstrate in the face of the regime. All such gains will turn out to be untenable over time unless the working class takes state power, but none of them could have existed for a moment under the Shah’s rule.
Every one of these gains was achieved against the wishes of Khomeini’s various governments. In addition, the regime itself has been forced to take other steps as the price it had to pay the masses in order to hold power. Khomeini cut off Iran’s previously generous oil supply to the U.S., South Africa and Israel. This modest blow to imperialism was accompanied by the removal of 40,000 U.S. military personnel and their bases from Iran, to the dismay of every reactionary in the Middle East.

The gains achieved by the Iranian revolution are not its alone but belong to the working class everywhere. They must be defended against an Iraqi victory which would put back into power friends of the Iraqi rulers, who also happen to be friends of the former Shah.
Why then is the fundamental class line so hard for many on the left to see? To them the situation appears impossibly complex. After all, the Iraqi “Arab socialist revolution” is at the throat of the Iranian “Islamic revolution.” How can one understand the shift from the covert support given Iraq by the U.S. government at the start of the war to the covert support given Iran by the same government later on? How could the “revolutionary” president of Iran publicly embrace unrepentant officers of the ex-Shah who are warring against a state that embraces other officers of the same Shah?
What renders the events so complex in appearance is the deviousness of the contending ruling classes and the illusions and false consciousness of the masses. If there was a revolutionary communist vanguard leading the working class (or even vying for its leadership), the fundamental dividing lines of class versus class and revolution versus counterrevolution would show through the layers of muck. The masses’ illusions in their rulers could be dissipated daily.
A proletarian vanguard would fight to enlist the Iranian masses behind a program to qualitatively deepen the gains of the revolution. It would call for the workers’ seizure of power to establish a proletarian state, based upon the shoras and maintained by an armed people. It would stand for the right to self-determination for all national minorities, including the right to independence. It would call for land to the peasants. It would fight for separation of church and state and couple this with the party’s own efforts to educate against religious mysticism. It would accelerate the struggle against imperialism by aiding the revolutionary struggles in surrounding countries, all of which are powder kegs. It would fight above all for a socialist federation of the Middle East.

In the present war a genuinely communist vanguard, not yet able to take power and overthrow Khomeini, would offer a military bloc to the regime to the extent that it actually fights the Iraqi counterrevolution. But it would not cease its revolutionary political opposition to the regime and would continue to work for its overthrow. It would call for mass mobilizations for the war independent of the regime. If it was represented in the Majlis (parliament), it would vote against war credits to the government to show its lack of confidence in it. It would attempt to fraternize with the discontented Iraqi soldiers and align itself with the masses throughout the Middle East; in particular, it would defend the Kurds against the ongoing attacks from Teheran during the war. Above all, it would warn that Khomeini, while not immediately firing on the revolution as are the Iraqis, will do so at the earliest opportunity.

Leftists Betray Workers
Such a program would force the underlying class issues to the surface. But the muck keeping them concealed is not the creation of counterrevolutionaries alone. The far left in Iran, as we shall show in this article, has proved unable to find the Marxist road forward. And what passes for the left in the U.S. is no better. We plan to take up the specific obfuscations of American leftists in a subsequent article, but now it must be pointed out that the League for the Revolutionary Party was condemned on all sides for our position on Iran at the outset of the revolution. Leftists who liked the revolution approved of Khomeini (or declined to say otherwise in public); those who disliked Khomeini refused to support the masses in their revolution.
Today, ironically, many of those who claimed that we were not really supporting the revolution have now deserted the revolution’s defense. Others, who were forced by Khomeini’s most blatant anti-revolutionary acts to timorously criticize his regime at long last, reverted in the face of the war to adulation of the regime. And some who supported the Shah’s overthrow now are joining the scabs who opposed the revolution in the first place by turning their backs on the workers’ gains.
Fortunately, there are signs that the Iranian working class itself has begun to learn not to confuse Khomeini’s rule with its own revolutionary aspirations. Workers do not have the class luxury of abandoning the military defense of their gains in favor of purer struggles. It is with them that we take our stand, not with a fraudulent middle-class “Marxism” unable to tell progress from reaction or distinguish between the leaders and the led. The workers in Iran still have the opportunity to sort out the contending socialist forces, make themselves aware of the necessary tasks and build a genuine Trotskyist revolutionary party in time to turn the present war to the advantage of their class throughout the world.


The War Begins
On September 22, Iraq abruptly escalated its incessant border attacks against Iran into a full-scale invasion. In the first few days the Iraqi blitz seemed unstoppable. The Western press reverberated to the trumpets of victory blared in Baghdad: Khorramshahr, Abadan, Ahwaz and Dizful had fallen or were just about to fall. Saddam Hussein, president of Iraq and head of its ruling Baath party, was heralded as the new strongman of the Middle East.
As of this writing, however, Iraqi control over the Iranian cities it has besieged is at best partial and is still hotly contested. The Iranian defense has unexpectedly stiffened and a bitter war of attrition has begun. Saddam Hussein can no longer dream of empire; he must now fight for more limited goals and for the life of his regime. Nor will the desert war continue in isolation. It already has shown the potential to engulf the Middle East and has drawn the military attention of the major imperialist powers. The Iraqis’ hope for a quick victory without external interference has disappeared.
Iraq’s original stated war aims were to seize full control over the Shatt al Arab, the estuary of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and the key waterway for transporting Iraqi and Iranian oil to the Persian Gulf and the world. The Iraqis also claimed borderlands extending up to 90 miles into Iran. As well, they claimed three supposedly strategic islets near the Straits of Hormuz, the gateway to the Persian Gulf -- not for Iraq itself, Saddam Hussein grandly announced, but for the whole “Arab nation.”
But Iraq’s aims were actually far more ambitious. The battleground for much of the war was the Iranian province of Khuzistan, known to the Iraqis as Arabistan. In it live a large number of Arabs who have been in conflict with the Khomeini regime. It also contains Iran’s major sources of oil and its principal refineries. Most significantly, it has been a focal point for revolutionary activity by the working class.
In the first few days of the war, the Iraqis claimed the support of the Arab population of Khuzistan. Saddam Hussein could not expect to win outright control, but he did hope that his troops would be able to oversee a nominally independent Arabistan as an Iraqi protectorate. Likewise, he hoped that the war would give him an increased role in dominating the Persian Gulf, a task once performed by the Shah of Iran with his U.S.-supplied military power. Military domination over the strategic oil route would have placed Hussein on the international stage and would have given Iraq the pre-eminence in the Arab world once held by Egypt under Nasser, a position now vacant.
Above all, the war aims of Iraq included the establishment of a new regime in Iran which would quell the incessant pressure for revolution in Iraq and other Arab states emanating from the turbulence of Iran. The secular Baathist regime in Iraq is Sunni Moslem in background, in contrast to the generally less privileged Shiite majority of the population. The Iraqi Shiites have been the object both of intensive oppression by the Baathists and of religious and anti-Baathist appeals by the Khomeini forces. However, it is not Khomeini’s propaganda that represents Iraq’s fundamental problem.
 
Mass Upheavals in Western Asia

For the Iraqi rulers, far more frightening than Khomeini’s strength was his weakness, his inability to prevent the disintegration of Iran. Iran’s revolution had been brought about not by Khomeini but by the masses’ unwillingness to put up any longer with the rule of the Shah. For the year and a half since the Shah was ousted in February 1979, the Ayatollah and all his men could not put Iran back together again. He maneuvered between liberal nationalist subordinates like former Prime Minister Bazargan and President Bani-Sadr and Islamic fundamentalists like Ayatollah Beheshti, head of the Islamic Republican Party which holds the majority in Parliament, and current Prime Minister Rajai, but Khomeini could not prevent the polarization of Iranian society as the masses fought to achieve oft-promised benefits. The large Kurdish minority had moved into open warfare to gain its rights, and other minorities like the Arabs and Azerbaijanis were continually restive. Workers’ councils were expanding rapidly in many industrial areas in Khuzistan and elsewhere and were increasingly coming into conflict with the Khomeini regime.
A free Kurdistan, wrested out of the Ayatollah’s hands by a successful Kurdish struggle, would have had a tremendous impact on Iraq, which also has a large Kurdish minority with a rebellious history. No less was the danger for Saddam Hussein of the workers’ councils mushrooming just over the border among kindred Arabs in Khuzistan -- especially for an Iraqi regime that tolerates no independent trade unions internally. Iraq’s main war aim was to smash the Iranian revolution. The fact that Saddam Hussein chose a path different from that of the U.S. or the USSR towards this end (or, for that matter, different from those of the other Arab states or the Iranian ruling class itself) does not mean that the goal was different. It merely proves that capitalists even when uniformly hostile to a common enemy still pursue their normal narrow self-interest.
The uncontained Iranian revolution was constantly threatening to spill over its borders, not least because the Middle East and all of Western Asia have been tottering at the edge of anarchy. In India, Indira Gandhi’s regime has been paralyzed in the face of communal, religious and class struggles including general strikes. In Pakistan General Zia ul-Haq conjures up every reactionary trick in the book to stay afloat on a sea of mass hostility, as Pakistan’s economy labors under a foreign debt totalling 41 percent of its gross national product. In Turkey, the military has just seized power in a desperate attempt to repress and stabilize a country beset by seemingly permanent polarization. In Afghanistan, the Russian invaders have made little headway in pacifying the reactionary-led bands that control much of the country. Nor have they been able to prevent anti-government activity by the left-nationalist Khalq. Saudi Arabia, despite all its oil riches, trembles under the threat of its foreign, though chiefly Arab, proletariat; rebellions are now a feature of life in the oil fields. (To maintain order, the Saudi rulers have brought in Pakistani troops whose primary virtue is their inability to speak Arabic and thus be contaminated by the contagion of revolution.) Likewise Kuwait and the Arab Emirates fear their radical, alien and combustible working classes. Lebanon is no longer a nation but a bloodbath contained within artifical borders by foreign forces. Egypt, the most populous Arab country, is growing restless in the absence of the prosperity promised by President Sadat through his capitulation to the U.S. and Israel. Israel itself, the seemingly impregnable colonial-settler bastion of Western imperialism, is rent by political and economic crises and finds it necessary to step up its repression of the Palestinians.
This festering instability is a consequence of enormous class struggles that are emerging throughout the region. They are frequently refracted through the prisms of national wars and religious upheavals. The masses who cannot achieve their goals within the framework of capitalism nevertheless seek every opportunity to do so before trying the only possible successful solution, socialist revolution.

Nationalism and Counterrevolution

The upheavals throughout Western Asia testify both to the mortal crisis of imperialism and the indomitable struggle of the masses against capitalism. They also demonstrate that these struggles have been thwarted and betrayed by nationalism, a bourgeois ideology in all of its myriad forms.
The reason for this tragedy lies outside of the Middle East. The masses of the colonial world went into struggle after World War II without a proletarian leadership at home and without the beacon of successful proletarian revolutions in the advanced capitalist countries. The Stalinized Communist Parties in Western Europe, still bearing the mantle of the Bolshevik revolution, helped usher the old imperialist regimes back into power and thus betray European and colonial workers. In Eastern Europe, Stalin’s legions ran roughshod over workers’ revolts and destroyed the workers’ revolutionary achievements wherever they appeared. Before the war, Leon Trotsky and the Fourth International had correctly concluded that Stalinism had passed definitively over to the side of counterrevolution and imperialism. Trotsky even underestimated the pace of counterrevolution, for Stalin and the Soviet bureaucracy were able to complete the overthrow of the degenerating workers’ state in Russia and reestablish capitalism by 1939.
Because of the worldwide defeat of the forces of proletarian internationalism, the post-war revolutionary movements fell into the hands of anti-working class petty-bourgeois nationalists, who styled themselves as “African socialists” in Africa, “Communists” in China and Vietnam and “Arab socialists” or “Baath socialists” in the Middle East. This was because the weakness of local capitalism in the colonial areas demanded a strong role for the bourgeois states which the nationalists wanted. But the socialist label was necessary above all to harness the power of the working masses who thought that their leaders were breaking with the imperialism they hated and launching the struggle toward communist equality and abundance.

Whatever the labels and differences, each of the new states could only attempt to build a nationally dominated capitalism replacing that of the imperialist masters. The Marxist theory of imperialism is based upon the understanding that no backward capitalist power can rise to the level of the most advanced during the imperialist epoch, the highest stage of capitalism. The dominant imperialists must expropriate surplus-value from the entire world to maintain their own existence, and more backward capitalisms are forced to integrate and submit. (For our elaboration and interpretation of this theory, see Socialist Voice No. 2, pages 20-22.) Inevitably, the petty-bourgeois nationalists brought only squalor inequality, humiliation and a more or less roundabout route back to dependency upon the imperialist powers. China, with once the most radical of such regimes, now seeks to be America’s staunchest reactionary ally. The path from nationalist-led revolution to counterrevolution is nowhere more evident today than in Iraq and Iran.

Limits of Iraqi Nationalism
The nation-state of Iraq was created after World War I by British imperialism; it continued until 1958 as a nominally independent kingdom under the control of businessmen, landowners and tribal sheiks. Under the inspiration of the Egyptian revolution of 1952, a mass uprising broke out in 1958 and toppled the pro-British monarchy. The new government was a coalition among Westernized army officers, the Baath party “socialists” and the overtly bourgeois democratic parties. The previously underground Communist Party also took part. Without an alternative leadership, the masses were tied to a regime that promised much but gave little. The paramount leader, General Kassim, soon reneged on his social promises and attempted to crush all dissidence and mass organizations. He fell from power in 1963; after a series of coups, the radical Baathists seized power in 1968 and Saddam Hussein became the strongman of the new government led by General al-Bakr.
The new regime was no more capable of fulfilling the masses’ needs than the old; nor was it yet capable of stifling the Kurdish nationalists or its leftist political opponents who reflected popular ambitions. In 1973, the Baathists formed the “National Progressive Front” government which included the Communists and the Kurdish Democratic Party. But agreements with the Kurdish rebels broke down and civil war ensued. While Russia armed its Iraqi ally, the Kurds were sent arms by Syria, Israel, the U.S. and Iran in an effort to weaken the radical, pro-Russian regime in Baghdad. To end the war and the decade-long conflict between reactionary Iran and radical Iraq, al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein signed the treaty of Algiers in 1975 with the Iranian Shah. By this treaty, the border along the Shatt al Arab was readjusted in Iran’s favor and Iran withdrew all support for the Iraqi Kurds, thus ending the rebellion.

The Shah’s new alliance, a subimperialist stronghold of counterrevolution in the Middle East, enabled the Baathists finally to overcome all their leftist opponents and mop up what was left of the mass movements in Iraq. Hussein also eliminated al-Bakr and executed other high-ranking Baathists. The Iraqi Communist Party was forced underground again, and leading Communists were killed. All the vestiges of the popular organizations thrown up during the revolution were wiped out. The now-counterrevolutionary Iraqi regime came to the Shah’s aid directly as well. The Ayatollah Khomeini had been allowed to live in exile in Iraq while directing hostile propaganda against the Shah; in 1978, at Teheran’s request, he was forced out of the country and in 1979 Hussein cracked down harshly on all Shiite groups. As the Shah’s government was toppling, Baghdad gave Empress Farah a royal welcome as a public show of support.
Hussein represents for the Iraqi revolution what Sadat does for the Nasserist revolution in Egypt, its gravedigger. It is both ironical and logical that Saddam Hussein’s most ardent Arab supporter today is King Hussein of Jordan, the former partner of the former Iraqi king in the monarchial federation set up to counter Nasser’s United Arab Republic. Whereas the Arab nationalists once reviled the pro-Western Arab despotisms as much as the West itself (for example, the Yemeni monarchy backed by the Saudis fought a civil war against republican rebels supported by Egypt under Nasser and Sadat), today one cannot tell apart Jimmy Carter’s friend Sadat from King Khalid. And the once-bitter animosity between Baathist Iraq and Saudi Arabia has been replaced since 1978 by the “Baghdad-Riyadh axis.”
Saddam Hussein’s political friendship with the Shah extends beyond the grave. Iraq has been allowing General Oveissi, the army commander under the Shah, to broadcast daily propaganda into Iran and, it is reported, to operate military training camps in Iraq. The Shah’s last Prime Minister, Shahpur Bakhtiar, has given unequivocal support to Iraq in the war and has announced plans for a new Iranian government to be installed after the Iraqi attack forces Khomeini out. The Iraqi nationalists have come full circle in wiping out the Iraqi revolution. Their regime is only one of several counterrevolutionary currents seeking to restore stability to the Gulf, but it is the one that stands in the best position today to attack the Iranian revolution.

Iran and Islam
If counterrevolution is international in scope, so much the more so is revolution. Underneath the nationalist and religious ideologies, the same class struggle and the same necessities motivate the masses and set up the potential for a solidarity unknown to the bourgeoisie.
The Iranian revolution has had an enormous impact upon the oppressed everywhere. Despite all the propaganda in the Western press, a spirit of exhilaration swept the neo-colonial world as the Iranians crushed the monarchy armed to the teeth by the US. and stood off American threats for two years. Even though the Iranians are not Arabs, popular sentiment in the Middle East for Iran persists despite the current war. Youssef M. Ibrahim, a New York Times correspondent, wrote on October 26:


There is no precise way to gauge the degree of Ayatollah Khomeini’s influence in the Gulf. There are no polls. News organizations print and broadcast what they are told to by governments. Most political dissent is suppressed and kept out of the public eye.
But in many casual conversations two weeks ago in Basra, the large city in southern Iraq and a Shiite stronghold, it was more than obvious that people did not have much sympathy for their government. A typical comment in the dusty bazaar was: ‘If you ask what they really think, people will tell you that in their heart they are all for Khomeini, He is a man of God.’ How can one fight that? This is a feeling that is sensed elsewhere in the Gulf among Shiites and Sunni Moslems almost equally.


Ibrahim added that “there was a clear demarcation between the rulers’ coolness... and the sense of awe and respect of ordinary people” toward the Iranian leadership.
According to this report and many others, it is Islam that accounts for much of the international solidarity in the “third world” for the Iranian revolution. How did this come about? How was it that Islam played such a large role in what was a fundamentally urban revolution, where the Shah was brought down by the modern expedient of a workers’ general strike? This question gets to the heart of much of the confusion over Iran’s revolution.


Secular Bourgeoisies Fail
The most common explanation is that under the Shah’s rule the only institution allowed to exist legally outside royal control was the Mosque. Therefore it had a head start in organizing popular opposition to the Pahlavi regime. But more has to be said. Eric Rouleau, chief Middle Eastern correspondent for Le Monde who evidently has the confidence of various Iranian leaders, has accurately portrayed the revolutionary movement as a political movement with a religious face. No more than the usual proportion of leaders and followers of the Islamic revolution are insincere in their religious beliefs, but there are all sorts of goals on this earth, not in paradise, that the masses expect from Khomeini and Islam. One U.S. correspondent (MERIP Reports, March-April 1979) quoted an Iranian worker: “We want Khomeini. He will take power from the rich and give it to us.”
Throughout history mankind has frequently expressed its political, economic and social strivings through religious superstition. (To a certain extent that phenomenon plays a role in the current Polish struggles.) But such a general observation does not account for the specific popularity of Islamic fundamentalism today.
Throughout the Middle East (and the world) the decidedly secular nationalism of the Westernized classes -- the bourgeoisie, the professionals, the intellectuals, the military -- has failed in its promise to break the grip of imperialism. As the situation worsens for the masses they search for an answer. Where the nationalist bourgeoisies failed, the pseudo-communists who backed them also showed their bankruptcy. The Tudeh Party (the Iranian pro-Moscow Stalinists) both backed the upper class anti-Shah nationalists and defended Russia’s cooperation with the Shah’s bloody regime; it certainly offered the masses no genuine alternative. Today it tails Khomeini, and the result is the same.

Secularism today is rife with its cynical acceptance of the imperialist facts of life, and its left face is hardly more attractive. That is the source of the rise of militant Islam as a political movement. Through religion it promises an alternative to the corruption and pro-Western betrayals of the traditional nationalists. The mullahs object to the liquor, lifestyle and relative freedom for women that they associate with the West. But what draws the masses is Islam’s promise of equality, prosperity and the end of imperialism. Islam also presents itself as more than simply nationalist; it is Pan-Arab or Pan-Islamic. But it too offers the masses no future.
Islamic nationalism has triumphed so far in two countries, Libya and Iran. While Libya supports Iran in the current war, there is no love lost between Libya’s Qaddafi and Khomeini. “Arab socialism” was previously supposed to link Egypt, Syria and Iraq in a close international unity but it forever broke down upon the shoals of bourgeois nationalism. So too the “internationalism” of the religious variety can not overcome the parochial basis of neo-colonial capitalism to establish a genuine solidarity. The Islamic rulers, just like their more mundane opponents, must also protect their capital base. They too struggle with the West to broker a higher percentage of the wealth that imperialism extracts from their resources and exploits from their working classes.
Iran and Libya, as oil-producing countries, can use OPEC to augment their share of the oil profits, but it is the imperialist oil cartels who control the markets and the industry generally -- despite the West’s attempt to blame the Arabs for the economic ruin the world faces. The income of the oil-producing countries depends on the viability of the capitalist world economy. They lose if industrial production in the U.S., Western Europe and Japan winds down; they lose if the dollars they hold become worthless; they lose if the banks they must place their funds in collapse, if the technology they need for oil production and industrial development is no longer generated, if they cannot get the armaments they need to compete with their equally avaricious neighbors.
In Iran, the mullahs have a particular tie to the bazaar merchants who seek more political and economic influence for themselves at the expense of the big bourgeois compradors enriched by the Shah’s favoritism. They do not wish to eliminate the upper bourgeoisie but to join it. The mullah’s link with a section of the bourgeoisie is organic, unlike their appeal to the masses. For the masses Islam is false consciousness. It is an obscurantist lie which accepts bourgeois secularism’s self-identification, with science and materialism in order to reject both. It reflects some of the masses’ aspirations and distorts others in order to deflect the workers and their oppressed allies from their material potential. This can only be achieved by the workers’ fighting for their real interest, an internationalist revolution to establish a scientific socialist society which could overcome both the middle-class secular and religious superstitions of bourgeois life


The Regime vs. the Working Class
The Iranian revolution gave rise to a prolonged struggle between the capitalist and pro-capitalist classes and the workers of Iran. It began when the workers’ general strikes and revolutionary councils played the major role in destroying the Shah’s regime. Mehdi Bazargan, the first prime minister of the new government, attacked those who “say that the army must be destroyed and councils run the affairs of the nation, and that people must be in a state of revolution all the time. If this goes on we will have no alternative but to resign.” (This was cited in an important article, “Workers’ and Peasants’ Councils in Iran” by Shahrzad Azad in the October Monthly Review.) Another Khomeini aide was more direct: he damned militant workers as “prostitutes.” Khomeini himself repeatedly warned the workers that they would be dealt with harshly. Azad summarized the situation: “The position of the new regime was that councils should be formed by the government.”

From the outset the regime attempted to strengthen its control over the workers and other mass movements. It waged a month-long campaign to take control of oil production out of the hands of the councils and try to pressure the workers into raising production. It began a bitter war against the Kurds and attacked Azerbaijanis, Arabs and other national minorities as well. Iranian women, who played a large role in the uprisings against the Shah, were faced with measures aimed at imposing the veil as an obvious prelude to even more restrictive steps. This attempt was met in March 1979 with a mass demonstration by women in Teheran, which succeeded in stalling the attack but only for a while.

Workers’ Struggle Resurges
The regime’s central assault was against the working class. Many of the shoras were taken over initially by instrumentalities like the “Imam’s Committees” and the Pasdaran, the revolutionary guards loyal to the clergy. Religious workers were pitted against the non-religious, and the left bore the brunt of the purges. So long as people believed that the Islamic regime could deliver on its promises, the struggles favored the government.
But as conditions worsened and the government took harsher measures, the struggle reignited. It is easy to see why. Nearly 4 million people (out of a population of 35 million, of whom 10.4 are “economically active”) are unemployed, and the number is growing. The annual inflation rate is 50 percent. Industrial investment and production are down sharply. Oil income, the foundation of the economy, was very low even before the war, bringing in at best half of the projected $23 billion annually.
By August 1979 the workers’ struggle was resurgent and shoras began to flourish among both the workers and the peasants, especially in minority areas. The clash between the Kurds and the regime reached a climax with the military defeat of the Khomeini forces. The December 1979 issue of Kar (Labour), the English-language publication of the leftwing Fedayeen organization, published an analysis written in late October:


The class consciousness of the workers has rapidly increased. ... It must be noted, however, that the majority still believe that the clergy and the government cannot meet their demands “because of their current difficulties,” and they still hope that something will be done, but it is true to say that since the uprising, most of the hopes, ideals and beliefs have gradually disappeared. Many workers now know that neither the government nor the clergy intend to meet the principal demands of the working class.

 With all due consideration paid to the mixed consciousness of the masses, it is indeed true that the regime was in considerable trouble, unable to reorganize the economy and unite the contending classes behind its bourgeois program. At this conjuncture, the “Students Following the Imam’s Line,” a militant Islamic group linked to sections of the Islamic Revolutionary Party (IRP), seized the U.S. embassy and held its staff hostage, demanding the return of the Shah who was then hospitalized in New York. They also demanded the wealth he stole, an apology for past U.S. interference and other concessions. The Khomeini leadership seized upon the resulting showdown with America to enroll the fervently anti-imperialist masses once again under its banner.
For the masses had come to distrust the regime’s anti-imperialism. Oil workers had held down production -- to the dismay of the regime -- both to safeguard Iran’s major resource and to prevent it from being shipped to particularly hated reactionary states such as South Africa and Israel. Shortly before the embassy seizure it was reported (U.P.I., New York Daily News, October 29, 1979) that the Joint Oil Workers Syndicate had issued a statement quoted in the Teheran Times saying:


We warn that if the Iranian government fails to act in demanding the extradition of the hated Shah, or the United States refuses to heed their demand, the bold workers in south Iran will reconsider the export of oil to America and will in fact cut the U.S. oil supply.

The Teheran Times added that the union charged that the Shah’s admittance to the U.S. “has not taken place without the blessing of the Iranian foreign ministry.” The oil workers were entirely right to be suspicious. Unfortunately, Khomeini was able to support the embassy seizure in order to divert the struggle into a nationalist confrontation; his support was aimed at preventing the masses from linking their anti-imperialist consciousness to a struggle to overthrow capitalism in Iran. Nevertheless, the seizure was a distorted product of the class struggle that also diverted Khomeini’s regime from its attempted compromise with imperialism.
The embassy affair and, later, the abortive American raid on Iran did rally mass support for the regime, but this could not overcome deteriorating material conditions and a polarizing class situation. In March of this year the regime began its crackdown again. In his well publicized message to the nation on March 21, Khomeini announced that strikes would be prohibited and that strikers could be hauled before the Islamic courts as “counterrevolutionaries.” He further pronounced inhibitions against peasant land seizures and inaugurated a witchhunt in the universities. He condemned the left explicitly and announced that the coming year would see the restoration of “order” and “security.”

Khomeini’s speech initiated an attack on the workers, peasants, national minorities and the left in defense of capitalism. The regime needed to reduce its “International isolation” -- its distance from the imperialist powers and their pawns. To restabilize the Iranian economy it needed not only passivity from the masses but American and Western help. The imperialists were likewise willing to cooperate in such a stabilization by anyone, including Khomeini, because of their fear of the spread of revolution.
Fully half of the Iranian army as well as the Pasdaran were hurled once again into war against the Kurds. The Kurdish Democratic Party, itself moderate and nationalist, had been in conflict with the more revolutionary Kurdish peasants over land seizures, but Khomeini’s attack forced the Kurds to unite behind their more conservative leaders.
The regime also moved to “Islamicize” and close down the universities. Increasing strength by campus leftists and the growing chasm between them and the regime’s supporters reflected the deepening class struggles beyond college walls. The regime not only moved to expel leftist groups but sent the thugs of the IRP, the Hezbollahs (Followers of the Party of God), to physically attack every leftist demonstration in Teheran for a period of months. There were murders as well as beatings that resulted, and the thugs, lumpenproletarians and patronage dependents of the mullahs, were frequently abetted by the Pasdaran.
As the political climate shifted, John Kifner reported in the New York Times (May 30) that “In the street, complaints against clerical rule are increasingly open and the word ‘akhound,’ a derogatory term for the Moslem clergy, is often heard.”

The Role of the Shoras
In the countryside, the Pasdaran have come to the aid of beleaguered landlords when the peasant struggles for land heightened. The regime also turned increasingly hostile to the workers’ shoras in the cities. Azad points out that “The policy of the Islamic Republic has been to discredit, deform or dismantle these councils; and in recent months, certain factory councils, peasants’ councils and students’ councils have been the target of verbal and physical attacks.”
The shoras are highly heterogenous in nature, many being entirely working class while others include some managerial personnnel as members as well. Some still favor the regime while others are independent and antagonistic. Few accurate statistics are available to us at this time, but it is clear that the shoras are widespread in the major industrial centers. In some cities there are central shoras coordinating and responsible to the local factory and industry councils. In the months prior to the war, the proletarian shoras were spreading throughout Iran and radicalizing.
In an interview in Socialist Worker of September 1980, an Iranian leftist, Shirin Rani, reported that the government has “lost control over the ‘Islamic’ workers councils” in the vital oil industry. “Two days after a national meeting of 1000 oil workers delegates, the Revolutionary Court ruled that the councils must be disbanded. Yet they have been unable to make their order effective.” Rani also points out that the IRP recently lost control over the shora at the huge Ahwaz rolling mill. It immediately set up an Islamic Association of only 12 to 20 people to counter the shora. “Yet three weeks ago two members of the IA were expelled from the factory when it was proved that they had been members of the old secret police, SAVAK.” He added: “A few days later they ejected Ayatollah Jannati, head of the Revolutionary Court, who attempted to intervene. In the past in Iran it was enough to bring in a mullah to quell a dispute.”

Another victory: in July, Teheran’s water workers discovered that their wages had been suddenly cut in half. 7000 went on strike and 2000 occupied the offices of the Water Board. The workers forced a meeting with President Bani-Sadr and won all their demands.
But the picture is by no means entirely rosy. Government workers, notably women, have been forced to retreat. The regime still retains its grip on many shoras. And, as Azad describes it: “In May the most militant of the Tabriz factories, the pro-Fedaii machine-tool plant and the farm tractor plant, were physically attacked by the ‘black gangs’ of the Islamic Republican Party and forced to dismantle their councils.”

Khomeini’s Regime
Despite all the setbacks and the continued influence of the clergy, the direction of the working class and its institutions has been clearly positive. Equally clear has been the motion of the regime. Indicative facts summarizing the first year of Khomeini’s rule were given by Michel Rovere in Intercontinental Press of August 4:


Last year 7 billion rials were spent for workers’ housing and 4 billion rials went to unemployed persons. On the other hand, the total aid to industrialists was 80 billion rials. Industrial debts benefitted from a one year moratorium, while the banking reform and the lowering of interest rates represented another gift of 300 billion rials to investors.

Although the regime is undoubtedly capitalist, fundamentally defending the interests of the Iranian bourgeoisie, Khomeini’s role cannot be so openly unambiguous. He acts as a Bonapartist figure, balancing between the competing wings of the bourgeoisie and upper petty bourgeoisie in order to appear as the spokesman for the “national interest” of both the capitalists and the working masses. He projects a populist egalitarian appeal on the one hand and attempts to rebuild bourgeois order and discipline on the other. This is the source of his frequent unwillingness to be specific, his incessant demagogy which is expressed through overriding religious generalities.
Within the ruling groups, Khomeini most comfortably spoke in pre-war days for the upper strata of bazaaris and petty bourgeoisie who see their salvation in a strong nationalist movement which would have a great appeal throughout the neo-colonial world. This would give them bargaining power within the world market which, although dominated by the imperialists, contains some room for maneuver because of the inevitable imperialist rivalries. To accomplish this, they require the resumption of orderly oil production, general stability and the obeisance of the working class and all of the discontented masses. They have tried to whittle away at the nationalized character of vital industries. The regime’s use of the Islamic appeal is designed to accomplish all this, but even Khomeini’s charisma has been unable to overcome the fundamental class struggle and establish the order and disciplined unity that they see in Islam.
The moderate wing of the bourgeoisie, represented currently by Bani-Sadr and Ghotbzadeh and formerly by Bazargan, is made up of those in the bourgeoisie who see that there is no hope for capitalism in Iran except through a restoration of commercial relations with imperialism. It has much in common with pro-Shah elements like Bakhtiar, who was a political associate of Bazargan in the old National Front, many of whose adherents are in Bani-Sadr’s camp today. The Moderates’ greater willingness to end the crisis over the American hostages reflects this attitude. This wing also includes the top layers of the military, only a small portion of which was purged by the new regime. Its Western-trained and U.S.-oriented political and technological leadership may or may not be loyal to the monarchy but will act for restoring imperialist ties under whatever government.
While Khomeini balanced between the class forces in Iran in order to defend capitalism, various pseudo-Marxists held that his class interests were different. The most common current believed that Khomeini’s populist Islamic rhetoric represented a major step towards socialism; this variety of opportunist leftism surfaces in every mass revolutionary event. But the uniqueness of the Iranian events brought out another species, represented by the Spartacist League in the U.S., who took Khomeini’s religious rhetoric seriously and warned that he was about to restore “feudalism” and return the country to the 7th century! No doubt many of Khomeini’s ideas are medieval; no doubt he did subject women to the chador and he did see to it that homosexuals, adulterers and others he called deviants were stoned to death. But he did not restore pre-capitalist society (which in Persia was not feudalism but oriental despotism) nor did he destroy any capitalist institutions. Modern-day capitalism is more than happy to tolerate such acts as long as bourgeois social relations are untouched.


Agents of Bourgeois Rule
Unlike the Western feudal lords who held political and economic power in their own hands, the bourgeoisie generally does not rule directly. The finandal and industrial oligarchs delegate political authority to special officers who form an executive committee for the management and defense of capitalism. There is usually a close fraternal relationship between the bourgeoisie and its political minions, but in a crisis this is not always the case. Thus reformist working class leaderships like the British Labour Party have run capitalism for the capitalists; so have Nazi petty-bourgeois thugs. Given the revolutionary and anti-imperialist sentiments of the masses, the Iranian bourgeoisie had to turn to Khomeini, and Khomeini has frequently had to turn away from the openly bourgeois types like Bazargan and Bani-Sadr to the religious “fanatics.” He uses the religious ideas as an opiate to satisfy and restrain the masses, as well as the Hezbollahs to discipline them. Indeed, the fanatical thugs have even been used against bourgeois elements themselves to keep them from demanding too obvious bourgeois rule and thereby risk the survival of their own system. Khomeini is a fanatical obscurantist but he is not the crazy fool depicted by American chauvinist commentators.
When the mass struggles gained in strength, Khomeini played his Islamic card to divert them. When he felt that the workers and national minorities could be successfully attacked, he allowed himself to link arms openly with the bourgeoisie through its “moderate” politicians. Also, he favored the moderates when it became clear that Iran’s decaying economy needs Western assistance. The West’s most far-sighted spokesmen have approved. When Khomeini’s attacks against the masses this past spring became evident, the New York Times wrote in an editorial (June 12):

Important revelations can come in ludicrous ways. In a midnight conversion to the views of Jimmy Carter, Ayatollah Khomeini declares that ‘the masses cannot any longer govern’ Iran, that the revolution has become its own worst enemy, that the nation needs a government to address its terrible problems and finally end the distraction of the hostage game.


Whenever Khomeini endorsed Bani-Sadr he was also compelled to slap his wrist in order to maintain his above-the-fray credentials. He had no intention of alienating his mass base in the petty bourgeoisie and more backward sections of the working class. He could afford no flat-out deal with the West such as the masses suspected Bani-Sadr of favoring.
The Islamic Republicans, on the other hand, used their anti-imperialist credentials through the popular hostage incident to win control of the Majlis (the Iranian parliament) and nibble away at Bani-Sadr’s powers; they succeeded, for example, in forcing the president to accept their candidate for prime minister, Rajai. For all its victories, however, the IRP has reached a dead end. Even the petty bourgeoisie relies on foreign trade. The most nationalist elements would go so far as to rupture friendly relations with the West but they would not want to see the economy sink. There is no independent route for the petty bourgeoisie; ultimately its top layers must come to terms with the dominant sectors of capitalism (which in the world today means imperialism and in Iran means the pro-imperialist bourgeoisie) unless it is displaced by socialism. Indeed, the increased verbal and physical attacks by the IRP’s thugs as well as the introduction of more anti-working class laws testify to the growing chasm betwen the IRP and the masses. The logic of events was pushing the workers’ shoras and their allies to the left and into confrontation with all wings of capitalism, including the Islamic reactionaries.

Effects of the War in Iran
The Iraqi attack was a godsend for the Ayatollah. At first it helped lock together the various polarizing class forces behind Khomeini. Workers, peasants and students, feeling that the issue was the defense of the revolution as a whole, flooded government offices to enlist. Even though the Western press at the outset of the war favored Iraq, it nevertheless communicated the amazement of the American intelligence officers and the reporters themselves at the unexpected spirit and defense put up by the Iranians. The contrast with Iraq was striking, for the Iraqi military has been very careful to rely on heavy weapons rather than infantry assaults out of fear that a large death toll would ignite anti-war rebellion at home. The Iraqis have got little or no response from the Arab people of Khuzistan to their “fraternal” appeals against Teheran.
But Iran, despite its much larger population and potentially stronger army, seems incapable of mounting an offensive. The regime’s unwillingness to arm the masses and the past decimation of the Shah’s army (and its current use as a political weapon) are the key factors. A Le Monde dispatch cited in the September 30 New York Times pointed out that the “authorities have had to turn many men down. In fact, radio broadcasts have discouraged people in certain cities, such as Tabriz, from signing up, saying that so far they have enough volunteers.” Tabriz, it should be noted, is the capital of Azerbaijan where Khomeini is not exactly popular.

In the first days of the war, the KDP announced its support for Teheran, and Kurdish forces blew up an Iraqi oil pipeline. Nevertheless, shortly afterward an Iranian dispatch announced the suppression of a Kurdish rebellion in Iran. It later became clear that the Iranian regime had taken advantage of the war to treacherously attack the Kurdish city of Mahabab:	Michel Rovere’s article in the October 30 Inprecor (French-language edition) quotes articles in Le Monde of October 15 and 16. 20,000 Iranian troops are maintained in Kurdistan away from the front with Iraq to keep the Kurds under suppression.
The bulk of the fighting in the besieged cities of Khorramshahr and Abadan has been carried out by the Pasdaran and irregular militia (some if not most of them organized by the leftist Fedayeen and Mojahedin). The French Press Agency (cited by Rovere) reported that the fighting in Abadan featured street barricades and actions by numerous neighborhood committees. It is not Teheran’s army which is bearing the brunt of the war.
French reporters covering the second Iraqi offensive of October 15 to 22 noted the almost total absence of artillery, helicopters and anti-tank missiles on the Iranian side defending Abadan. Rovere quoted Le Monde’s correspondent Eric Rouleau, who recalled how Iranian guerrillas had asked of him and Iranian journalists: “But where are our ground forces? Why are we not receiving heavy weapons and munitions? ... During the conflict with the Kurdish rebels we promptly received reinforcements and arms at the slightest request. But for three weeks our anxious appeals have gone unanswered.” It seems apparent that the regime is willing to let militant guerrillas perish heroically against Iraq rather than strengthen the workers of Khuzistan who have learned not to trust Teheran. In the same October 16 dispatch, Rouleau refers to the “almost total absence of the ground forces in the oil triangle” where the major fighting is taking place.

Behind the front it is the masses who are mobilizing to defend the revolution. In July, the Central Council of Islamic Shoras representing 900 factory councils called for the general arming of the population. Obviously the regime has not complied. Leftists report from Iran that shoras are raising militia and have set up schools to train fighters. Rovere indicates that neighborhood committees are now organizing rationing of goods and suppression of the black market, with even more autonomy from the clergy than in the February 1979 uprising against the Shah.
There is method to the regime’s seeming madness. The army is avoiding battle because it is being rebuilt for another purpose -- and it is being rebuilt. The regime had begun before the war to release from prison former SAVAK agents and pro-Shah officers; once the war started, this trend was accelerated. Some 200 airmen jailed for counterrevolutionary plots were freed along with a large but unspecified number of army officers. The air force officers were probably not pro-Shah like the army top brass; in fact, air officers had been in the forefront of the insurrection that toppled the monarchy. But they did constitute an upper-class elite, trained in the West, whom the government apparently wants to have available for use.
President Bani-Sadr was closely identified with the release of the officers. His stock has gone up during the war: for example, the Ayatollah awarded the Supreme Defense Council which he heads full power over the press, radio, television and all interviews by government officials. Technocrats and modern bourgeois elements like him appear to be the only “practical” people around, able to mobilize the armed forces and the wartime economy. Bani-Sadr has made little attempt to hide his willingness to deal with nonrevolutionaries. According to Rouleau of Le Monde, he said: “As far as I’m concerned, competence and patriotism come before fidelity to the regime.” (Washington Post, October 10).

Bani-Sadr’s attempt to rebuild the Iranian army’s officer corps, together with the limited fighting tasks given to it, show that the army’s strength is being saved to smash the revolutionary forces (the workers, peasants, minorities and many Pasdaran militants). This task also requires an alliance with imperialist forces outside Iran. Thus the president has been trying for some time, cautiously, to get the American hostages released in exchange for the approximately $350 million worth of military equipment and spare parts owed to Iran and the unfreezing of its assets held by Americans. In this venture Bani-Sadr has been joined by successive waves of defectors from the IRP, braving the anti-imperialist hostility of the masses. Still, a significant sector of the IRP has withstood the pressure placed on it by the regime and resisted any deal. But they fundamentally have no alternative to the re-establishment of solid bourgeois power based on an alliance with one or another imperialist force.
Given the Byzantine character of Teheran’s ruling class politics, it is impossible to predict who will emerge as the chief Khomeini lieutenant or government leader in the future. However, if capitalism is to survive, power must rest more squarely with the dominant bourgeoisie. A military attack on the masses’ gains will be needed and is being prepared. The army will not permit differences over whether the Shah or the new regime should have been supported in 1979 to prevent it from smashing the proletariat when all other measures have failed. It is not only the Iraqis who seek a military coup in Teheran. They differ from Khomeini and Bani-Sadr only in that they are firing their guns today while the latter are getting ready to do so tomorrow. If the Iranian working class does not come to understand these fundamental relationships of forces it will be crushed.

Imperialism and the War
The U.S. had long maintained its alliance with the Shah to safeguard imperialist exploitation of the Middle East. Not only did the imperialists wring oil profits out of Iran’s resources and workers, but they built up the Shah as a subimperialist military strongman to protect the entire Gulf region from revolutionary “anarchy.” When the Shah was ousted, the U.S. and its allies quickly decided that Khomeini, however distasteful he appeared, was the only hope for a new stabilization. Thus arms were sent to Iran in mid-1979 to strengthen Teheran’s war against the Kurds. And even after the hostage seizure, the U.S. government hoped Iran’s divided rulers would find a solution so that normal relations could immediately resume. But the U.S. also recognized that Khomeini could not assume the Shah’s pacifying role in the Gulf -- indeed, the Ayatollah was stirring up trouble for imperialism by widening the aspirations of Persian nationalism even more than the Shah dared in his last years.

For these reasons the United States initially “tilted” in favor of Iraq. The Western press played wish the idea of a Bakhtiar-Oveissi regime in Teheran inspired by Iraq, and the imperialists certainly were pleased with the idea of a quick war to choke off the disruptive effects of Iran’s revolution. At the very least they hoped Iraq would take over the Shatt al Arab and thereby lessen the chances of bottling up the oil supply. So for the first period of the war the U.S. expressed its “neutrality” by supporting Iraq’s phony cease-fire proposals that did not call for troop withdrawals and therefore could not have been accepted by Iran. Even more ominously, the U.S. took the opportunity of the war to greatly strengthen its naval forces near the Gulf. As well, it secured additional military bases in the region to the relief of pro-imperialist regimes. And AWAC (battlefield headquarters) planes were sent “for defensive purposes” to Iraq’s friend Saudi Arabia.
But as the war continued, the U.S. reconsidered. Saddam Hussein won no lightning victories, Khomeini’s rule was not undermined, and, worst of all, the belligerents did not refrain from bombing each others’ oil installations. If the war were to spread to other countries, its effects on world oil supplies could be disastrous. Thus the U.S. warned Jordan and Oman not to give aid to Iraq and demanded that Iraq limit its war aims to the Shatt al Arab. At the same time, the U.S. began making overtures to Iran: Iraq was labelled the “aggressor” in public, and Carter said that the military spare parts ordered by the Shah could be freed if the hostage question was settled. This was not simply an electoral ploy by Carter but a logical consequence of imperialism’s quest for stable allies in the Gulf region. Brzezinski had always favored a counterrevolutionary alliance with Islamic reaction, and the new moves recognized the careful steps toward accommodation being made by Bani-Sadr and Khomeini in Teheran.

The Russian imperialists played the diplomacy game in similar fashion. At the outset of the war Russia had a “friendship” treaty with Iraq but little real influence there since Baghdad had begun looking Westward for support. At the same time, the invasion of Afghanistan had confirmed Khomeini’s distrust of the superpower on his northern border. But Russia still preferred Khomeini to an overtly pro-Western ruler, even though it had lived quite easily with the Shah. Anything would be better than the alternative of destabilization and possibly revolution just over the frontier.
As we have demonstrated many times before (most recently in analyzing the Afghan events in Socialist Voice No. 9), Russia, like the West, is committed to the support of imperialist stability in the Middle East as elsewhere, and only desires a greater measure of influence for itself. A heightened role in the Middle East would enable the USSR to better defend itself in its inter-imperialist rivalry and would also be a bargaining point with the economically stronger West on which state capitalist Russia depends for vital capital and technology imports. So the Russian rulers tried to use their arms deal with Iraq to temper Hussein’s war aims and thus curry favor with Iran. Replacements continued to be supplied to Iraq through Jordan when the Shatt al Arab became unsafe for shipping, but transport of arms to Iran through Russian territory was also permitted.
Russia’s attitude was made clear by the pact concluded between the USSR and Syria during the war, an agreement that went beyond any the Russians had been able to secure previously in the Middle East. Syria was at swords’ points with its fellow “Arab socialists” in Iraq, and the new alliance enabled the Syrians to support Iran openly against its rival. Like Libya, which also backs Iran, Syria is not a Russian puppet, but the new pact is an indication of Russian diplomatic gains as a consequence of the war.

The imperialist powers are maneuvering to keep the area as stable as possible under the volatile conditions of outright war. That is their intent; however, their national self-interest could easily lead one or the other to fear that its rival was gaining too much influence with the local potentates and could thus precipitate a wider conflict. The lesser capitalist powers too are frightened by the regional volatility. The Arab states of the Gulf, for example, have publicly condemned but privately welcomed the increased U.S. and Western European forces sent in. And Israel is openly gleeful over the war because its enemies are killing each other, and the Palestinian Liberation Organization, its primary foe, has lost favor with all sides by trying to mediate. Israel fears that the U.S. might not take proper advantage of the situation while the Russians advance, but its main fear is that Khomeini will collapse and Iraq will be greatly strengthened. Thus it has leaned towards Iran throughout the conflict. The diplomatic interplay that puts Israel together with Libya and Syria on the side of Khomeini is quixotic but only the result of the necessary absurdities of capitalistic logic. Given that their own survival is at stake, the Israeli subimperialists have a sharp eye out for their interests. An aide to Prime Minister Begin summed up the situation accurately and concisely: “Khomeini is Kerensky” (New York Times, November 1). The Israelis and the more powerful imperialists offer support to Iran the nation, not the revolution; that is, they support the nationalist capitalist forces in Teheran out of fear that their weakness before the masses will result in their fall and the beginning of the collapse of imperialist power in the Middle East. For everyone knows what happened to the weak provisional government of Kerensky in 1917, when the masses would take no more and a revolutionary leadership was on the scene.	

The Iranian Left
The question of the leadership of the Iranian working class is absolutely crucial, both for determining the outcome of the immediate events and for the future of the revolution. Its power and revolutionary consciousness already established, the Iranian proletariat is facing decisions that will determine the fate of the masses throughout the Middle East. If it can find the route to proletarian revolution, the history of the world will be altered.
However, to our knowledge no organization on the Iranian left is following a genuine Marxist and Leninist strategy towards the revolution. The capitalist logic penetrating the radical petty bourgeoisie and even the most advanced sections of the working class has not yet been overcome. The Bolshevik position must be based on the following fundamental principles:


The Khomeini regime in all of its wings rules fundamentally to preserve the power of the bourgeoisie. The state it serves is capitalist.
The petty bourgeoisie, religious or secular, anachronistic or modern, has no potential for independent class power. Its top layers blend into the bourgeoisie and will inevitably support capitalism. Its plebeian base, urban and rural, can be won to an alliance dominated by the proletariat but only if that class poses a decisive way out of the social impasse.
Bourgeois national power, energized either by the bourgeoisie directly or by its petty-bourgeois minions, has no lasting independence in the industrially backward countries. It must inevitably align with one or another imperialist power and rejoin the world market as a subordinate factor.
Faced with a proletariat which struggles for class independence and ultimately state power, all the bourgeois forces and their top petty-bourgeois allies will in time go over to the counterrevolution. No intermediate democratic anti-imperialist state (whether “beneficent” capitalist or indeterminant in class character) can persist as opposed to the two real alternatives, bourgeois or proletarian rule. In this epoch, capitalism is imperialism and must succeed in super-exploiting the masses, and thus in destroying democratic gains, if it is to survive.

Only a workers’ state, the proletarian dictatorship, based upon institutions such as shoras or soviets can preserve the gains of the masses and offer an alternative to the miasma of capitalism. And just as capitalism is international, and no bourgeois state can survive in isolation, the proletarian revolution must be internationalist and must spur revolutions beyond national borders in order to survive.
To succeed, the workers must be led by layers conscious of their tasks and the necessity of state power. The most advanced and combative forces must organize into a vanguard party, part of an international revolutionary party.

Lessons from the Bolsheviks
These fundamental Marxist principles of this epoch are derived from Lenin’s analysis of imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism characterizing its epoch of decay, and Trotsky’s theory of permanent revolution. They have been deepened and validated by the success of the Bolshevik revolution, and confirmed in a negative way by the Russian counterrevolution and the rotting of all the petty-bourgeois nationalist “anti-imperialist” revolutions ever since.
Along with the basic principles, a number of necessary tactics were tested in the 1917 events and are applicable in other revolutionary situations that follow the same general laws. For example, the Bolsheviks offered a tactical military bloc to Kerensky against counterrevolution while maintaining their absolute political hostility to his government. In the current war, the proletarian military policy requires defense of Iran against the Iraqi attack. If Iran falls, the revolutionary gains and the shoras will be destroyed.
However, such a military bloc means above all the independent mobilization and arming of the workers based upon their shoras. It means warning the workers that although the Iraqis are the ones firing on them now, their own rulers will be doing so tomorrow -- thus not one iota of political support to Khomeini. If and when the regime uses the war as a cover for attacking the masses -- as the Khomeiniites attacked the Kurds -- then fire back and use the episode to open the social revolution against all the counterrevolutionaries. Such a revolutionary defense of Iran will prove to the masses that it is indeed the communists who are the best defenders of their interests rather than Khomeini who betrays them.
The greatest danger on the Iranian left today comes from the petty-bourgeois “socialists” who give political support, with criticisms or not, to the Khomeini regime. Such opportunist leftists hope to profit from the initial patriotism of the masses who are flocking to the defense of the regime. But as the war continues and the government’s counterrevolutionary activities become clearer, the working class will rapidly learn who are its leaders and who are its betrayers.


Tudeh’s Abject Betrayal
The most prominent left organization is the Tudeh party already mentioned. Because of its past betrayals, the Shah’s repression and its pro-Moscow line, it was unable to play any significant role in the revolution. Subsequently it has subordinated itself to Khomeini in every way: it was the only left group to vote for the Islamic Republic in the March 1979 referendum, and it proudly identifies its program with the Ayatollah’s. We have seen no reports on its activity during the war, but there is not the slightest reason to expect even a wobble in the Bolshevik direction.
Of the groups that consider themselves oppositionist and revolutionary the most significant at the moment are the Mojahedin (Organization of Freedom Fighters of the Iranian People) and the Fedayeen (Fighters, or Organization of Iranian People’s Fedayeen Guerrillas). We note that the translation of these names varies in the English-language press; we are using the most common spellings. The Fedayeen are also sometimes referred to by the initials OIPFG. Both of these groups waged guerrilla struggles against the Shah and have lost numerous martyrs in the struggle. Both are influential in the workers’ shoras. The principle ideological difference is that the Mojahedin considers itself to be radical Islamic, while the Fedayeen is “Marxist-Leninist,” that is to say, pro-Stalinist, in its historical orientation and in its present policy.
The Mojahedin policy towards the Khomeini government has been confused and ambiguous, reflecting its ideology that mixes devoutness with elements of Marxism. Its anticlericalism has gained it some support among the Westernized nationalists, including, some reports say, Bazargan and former foreign minister Yazdi. More recently there have been indications that Bani-Sadr is sympathetic towards a bloc with the Mojahedin. Such a link with the ruling bourgeoisie which is at the threshhold of counterrevolution would be complete betrayal of the working class.
The Fedayeen are smaller than the Mojahedin but more important in the shoras, even though they are primarily a student-based group like the rest of the far left. Because of their radical opposition to the regime, they suffered assassinations and tortures at the hands of Khomeini’s thugs -- as well as the Shah’s. Even so, they hold to the old Menshevik and, later, Stalinist conception of the two-stage revolution: first a bourgeois, anti-imperialist revolution and then ultimately a socialist revolution. The overthrow of the Shah would at first sight appear to represent the first stage, so that now socialist revolution would be called for, but when the Fedayeen were forced underground by Khomeini’s repression in the summer of 1979, they inserted what in practice amounted to an intermediate stage: the eventual replacement of Khomeini’s regime by bourgeois democracy. However sincere their opposition to the present regime, their politics makes them left-wing supporters of nationalist capitalism.

In June 1980 the Fedayeen split, with the majority changing its position to critical support of the Khomeini government; the minority holds something akin to the old position outlined above. The majority’s shift is a logical adaptation of the Fedayeen idea of an anti-imperialist people’s capitalism; when Khomeini made one of his leftward oscillations, the majority jumped aboard, declaring that anti-imperialist bourgeois democracy did not require his overthrow. Although it would prefer that the “anti-imperialist movement” be led by the proletariat instead of the confused and frequently anti-democratic petty bourgeoisie, under the existing circumstances the majority sees no alternative but to align with Khomeini and the IRP in order to direct its primary attack (“the spearhead”) against the “liberal capitalists” around Bani-Sadr who are capitulating to imperialism. (The special Summer issue of Kar (Labour) contains documents giving both the majority and minority views.)

Fedayeen Majority vs. Minority
The Fedayeen majority’s surrender to the Islamic petty bourgeoisie was a factor in disorienting the advanced workers. It ill prepared the workers for the attack launched by the regime against left students at the universities, including the “godless” Fedayeen. It also helped prevent workers from perceiving the inevitable role of Khomeini and the IRP marching in lockstep with Bani-Sadr in his attempt to override the anti-imperialist attitude of the masses during the war with Iraq. Worse yet, it politically disarmed the masses and attempted to blind them to the increasing counterrevolutionary acts of the Khomeini/Bani-Sadr/Rajai regime.

When the war broke out (according to Shahrzad Azad in the November 26 Guardian), the majority flocked to the colors and eventually signed up with the anti-working class Pasdaran! This is a consequence of its line of giving political (not just temporary, independent military) support to Khomeini and the ruling class.
The Fedayeen minority avoids giving support to any of the wings of the present regime, but it has a difficult time squaring this with its Stalinist-Menshevik theory of stages. The majority criticizes the minority (which it accuses of “leftism” and “Trotskyism”) for labelling all wings of the government “capitalist” without distinguishing between the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie; this is done, the majority argues, to avoid having to support the IRP, for the minority attributes “revolutionary and progressive characteristics to the petit bourgeoisie which only belong to the proletariat.”

The criticism seems to be accurate, although genuine confusion in both majority and minority documents makes it difficult to be certain. The minority has by no means reached the “Trotskyism” it is accused of because it still bears the scars of Stalinism and its class origins. The drive to the left cannot culminate in a truly communist position until it overcomes the idea that the alternative to the present state can be an anti-imperialist state ruled by the petty bourgeoisie and not a workers’ state in transition to socialism. According to Shahrzad Azad the Fedayeen minority does not call for the government’s overthrow because the masses support it and “the regime has some contradictions with imperialism.” This appears to be a strategic, not simply a conjunctural tactical line based on the immediate relationship of forces, because it coincides with the Fedayeen’s advocacy of a genuinely anti-imperialist capitalist state. As such, it helps prevent the advanced workers from learning that any form of capitalist government must ultimately be dealt with by revolution, for it is the capitalist state which is the enemy.


Genuine Trotskyism Necessary
On the war, Azad reports that the minority is defending Iran through independent combat forces along with the Mojahedin. This is a step forward compared to excerpts of the minority position (some of which were very confused) published in the U.S. by Young Spartacus and Workers World, where it appeared that minority supporters were condemning both sides in the war equally. At best, such a line will confuse revolutionary workers who have seized arms to defend their gains; at worst, it allows the banner of revolutionary defense to pass into the hands of Khomeini and Bani-Sadr, who will use it to promote counterrevolution.
The fact that newly developing leftists in Iran have so far been turned away from genuine Trotskyism is due in no small part to the abjectly opportunist mockery of communist politics presented by the pseudo-Trotskyist groups in Iran. The HKE, or Revolutionary Workers Party, is affiliated to and trained by the American SWP. It has continually apologized for Khomeini’s religious obscurantism, it backed the Islamicization of the universities against the student left, it champions the wearing of the veil -- and never even mentions the elementary Leninist idea that socialism requires the revolutionary overthrow of the present bourgeois regime (let alone the state!). It points to the danger of counterrevolution but never suggests that Khomeini might have a hand in it. When war broke out, the HKE urged the masses to jump onto Khomeini’s bandwagon: “Now for the defense of the revolution, it is necessary for the toiling masses of Iran to mobilize for war against imperialism as one united family, to close ranks, and to strike as one fist.” (Militant, October 10)
One united family indeed! The idea of ceasing to oppose the capitalists during any kind of war is an abomination to Bolsheviks. The fist will smash the workers if the HKE has its way.
As elsewhere in the world, the workers of Iran are moving forward almost in spite of their pretended leaders on the left. In the process they are laying the basis for a new leadership, a genuinely Trotskyist Fourth International, that will face the coming days of war, revolution and counterrevolution by following a clearcut line towards the socialist revolution. This is the only answer to imperialism and its servants, the nationalists of all stripes -- secular and religious, bourgeois and petty bourgeois, Stalinist and phony Trotskyist. The shoras are an important start. Arming the masses will also be crucial. The decisive step will be the creation of the revolutionary proletarian party, in Iran and throughout the world.

Foreword
The Life and Death of Stalinism
“In view of the incredibly widespread nature of the distortions of Marxism, our first task is to restore the true doctrine of Marx.” — Lenin, The State and Revolution

The eyes of the world are on the East. Millions watch with fascination and exhilaration as the “socialist bloc” crumbles. Country after country has been shaken by economic crises, mass struggles for democracy, collapsing governments and popular revolutions. Once-monolithic Communist Parties have discarded long-time leaders, fled the old party names and surrendered governmental positions. Mikhail Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping, the East’s most powerful leaders, are famed not for their triumphs but for their desperate attempts to overcome the failures of the bureaucratic system. “The Cold War is over and we have won,” proclaim the rulers and theorists of capitalism.
For many, it is not only the Stalinist system but Marxism that has failed, both as an interpretation of modern society and as a guide for revolutionary action. The Marxist goal of communism is seen at best as the ideology of a few well-meaning dreamers and at worst as a euphemism for some of the most oppressive and suffocating societies on earth. Moreover, since the alternative offered by the Gorbachevs and Dengs is to import capitalistic methods that revolutionists once fought to overthrow, revolutionary Marxism seems to have lost all validity. 
The answer presented in this book is that only Marxism can account for the remarkable turnabout in the Stalinist system. Only Marxism can probe to the roots of what makes these societies function as they do: the struggle between the exploited producing classes and the ruling class. Only Marxism could foresee Stalinism’s inevitable decay. Only Marxism can explain why the reformist Stalinists’ rescue plans will not suffice, why they cannot repair the contradictions at the heart of their system. And Marxism can show as well that the collapse of Stalinism presages a parallel crisis of world capitalism. If the West has won, its triumph will be brief.
This book uses the tools of Marxism to analyze the Stalinist system: the social and economic structure that arose out of the degeneration and defeat of the revolutionary Soviet workers’ state. It demonstrates that Stalinist society is fundamentally capitalist, an integral but subordinate part of international imperialism. 
Naturally the rulers of the pseudo-socialist states and their apologists reject any such analysis. But so do most “Marxist” critics of Stalinism. The Stalinist counterrevolution perverted not only the Soviet revolution but Marxism itself. The dialectical method — to study the change and development of society and uncover the essence beneath every surface appearance — has been abandoned. So has the analytic base of Marxism, the critique of political economy that exposes the internal contradictions and the impermanence of capitalism. Thus “Marxism” has been transformed into its opposite, a counterrevolutionary ideology.
To understand Stalinism it is necessary to understand capitalism. For this task it is necessary to resurrect Marxism in its authentic form as the revolutionary science of the working class, the only agency capable of overthrowing capitalism and thereby creating a world fit for human beings. This book is an important weapon in the effort to revivify the Marxism of Marx, of Lenin, of Luxemburg, of Trotsky, of the thousands of proletarians who have given their lives in the struggle for authentic communism.
The book destroys a whole series of myths that have encrusted Marxism. For example, it rips apart the now commonplace fallacy that the essence of capitalism is competition. As Marx explained, that was the theory of petty capitalists, not his. The book also systematically decimates the fashionable notion that Stalinism, despite its faults, maintained a centralized planned economy. Thus for us Gorbachevism is not an attempt to restore the “democracy” of the market but as a desperate bid to impose discipline and order on an anarchic economy — a bid doomed to failure.
For Marxists the test of theory is practice. The Marxist standpoint and method defended in this book already predicted, over a decade ago, the present devolution of Stalinism in the direction of more traditional capitalist forms. At the height of the Cold War we were able to predict that the dividing line for a future World War III would be drawn between Japan, Germany and the United States rather than between the U.S. and the USSR. When other “theories” treated the Soviet Union as a powerful system, as the wave of the future (for good or for evil), we saw it as weak and collapsing.
The importance of this book, however, does not lie in its predictiveness or in its reconstruction of the true meaning of Marxist categories alone. Its chief contribution is its demolition of so-called Marxists who have reduced Marxist conceptions (the commodity, exploitation, state property, the law of value, the falling rate of profit tendency, planning, accumulation, the productive forces, property relations, property forms, etc.) to technical categories. They have reified and objectified the class and human relationships which for Marx were embodied in these categories. They have turned Marx on his head and accepted bourgeois political economy in his name.
The triumph of pseudo-Marxism did not come through any conspiracy. The victory of Stalinism in the USSR led to the corruption of Communist Parties and “progressive movements” throughout the world. Revolutionary working-class upheavals were chained to the preservation of capitalism under the leadership of class collaborationists. Nationalism replaced internationalism. The authentic Leninists led by Leon Trotsky were murdered or marginalized.
The victory of the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union sent a message which jibed with the social attitude of large sections of the middle-class professionals and bureaucrats everywhere. Imperialism, as described by Lenin, had given rise to a labor aristocracy whose viewpoint reflected its material stake in capitalist society. As well, there arose an allied layer, the intelligentsia, which mushroomed especially during the prosperity boom following the Second World War. Dedicated to a radical reform of capitalism, many embraced the “Soviet experiment” when it was safely divorced from proletarian leadership.
The numerous defeats inflicted on the proletariat through the agency of Stalinism (China 1925-27, Germany 1933, Spain 1937, the USSR 1936-39 before the war; East Europe and elsewhere afterwards) deepened the cynicism of the intelligentsia toward the possibility of proletarian revolution — not only among pro-Stalinists but among their opponents on the left too. The “God that Failed” was not just the USSR but the working class as well. Workers were recognized not for their social power but for their numbers; like peasants, they could be manipulated “for their own good.” Their salvation was the bright man’s burden, the task of “servants of the people,” of social engineers. Marxism as the science of human self-liberation was gutted.
This book convincingly shows that the present collapse of Stalinism is intricately linked to the underlying crisis now facing world capitalism as a whole. Not by accident, the numbers and strength of the middle strata are also eroding. At the same time, the working masses are rising across the “East” and the “South.” Soon they will move in the North and West as well. As the revolution develops the workers will demonstrate not only their enormous social power but their growing revolutionary consciousness as well. They are in the process of re-creating their own class leadership — their own vanguard parties and International, the embodiment of their advanced consciousness. This book is one element in that process.
Once again the working class will pronounce its contempt for the “condescending saviors” who really work to save capitalism, knowingly or not. Once again the working class is coming to recognize itself as the inheritor of the entire history of humanity’s struggle for a better world. Capitalism, through the bestial means natural to it, has created the social and technical basis for future abundance. Under the leadership of the working class, humanity will be able to rid itself of problems now unnecessary and idiotic — starvation, war, exploitation, racism, sexism, chauvinism and human degradation in all its forms.
The Marxism of this book is the Marxism of those whom today’s “Marxists” have dismissed as utopian and naive. It embodies the belief that the workers will be motivated to produce abundance not by the whiplash of the market but by a common consciousness of their common ability to build a human, egalitarian world in which creativity and culture can flourish, in which “Humanity the Maker” can reach for the stars.
Can working people today achieve this destiny? Not as they are, but as they will be when in the course of making the socialist revolution they fit themselves for such deeds. This is a sophisticated book written to help destroy the sophisticated cynicism about human capacity that plagues our age. It is written in defense of the intellect and in class defiance of those who in their arrogance have misappropriated the liberating power of ideas.

 Stand: No to New Reformist Parties!








The following article, endorsed by the Communist Organization for the Fourth International (COFI), is an editorial from Proletarian Revolution No. 63 (Fall 2001).
 Auf Deutsch

Where We Stand:
No to New Reformist Parties!
We are entering a critical conjuncture in the political history of the left. Across the world, leading sections of the “far left” have made a dramatic turn toward reformism. In an effort to fill the political vacuum left by the collapse of Stalinism a decade ago and the parallel shift to the right by the social democratic and labor parties, left organizations that previously spoke of building Bolshevik-Leninist vanguards are now forming reformist parties and blocs committed to social-democratic programs.
We are not speaking of supporting reforms under capitalism, which revolutionaries often do. What we see today is a wholesale embrace of the anti-working-class reformist ideology, along with attempts to create whole new reformist institutions to replace the discredited ones. In some cases, the leftists are already taking the logic of their shift further: attempting to build or support openly class collaborationist populist parties and popular fronts.
Not by accident, this turn toward patching up the capitalist political system is occurring just when this system is once again proving itself to be unreformable. Temporary ups and downs cannot hide the fact that the global economy is foundering. Super-exploitation is rampant. The gap between the super-rich capitalists and the increasingly impoverished working class is widening, and the middle strata are disintegrating. Reformism is a proven failure: that is why the mainstream social democrats and liberals, whose firmest social base has always been in the middle class and labor aristocracy, are moving so rapidly rightward. The far left’s rehashed reformism has even less viability. Its program is worse than illusory: it is dangerously misleading, given the deepening crisis of the system.
In the language of Bolshevik-Leninism, “centrists” are those who, on the one hand, profess revolution and the independent organization of the vanguard sections of the proletariat but, on the other, practice reformism. Yesterday, unwilling to drop even small tactical differences for the sake of unity, the centrists maintained a wide variety of separate groups in each country and around the world. Today, they are beginning to cluster together, but not in efforts to forge even rhetorically revolutionary unified organizations. Instead they are embracing the few left reformist politicians who still survive and, with them, attempting to resurrect dying social democracy. (We note that we predicted some years ago that the centrists would form new reformist parties to fill the space abandoned by the undisguised social democrats. See COFI Sets International Tasks in PR 48.)
Lenin and Trotsky taught us that reformism and populism were counterrevolutionary doctrines dressed up in progressive language. In opposition to the current trend, authentic communists who applaud the death of reformism and want to fight its resurrection must regroup on a principled program and fight this new betrayal. In response to the centrist turn to reformism, communists have to redouble their efforts to re-create the revolutionary party of the proletariat in their own countries, as part of a politically restored genuine Fourth International.
The New Reformism
The most widespread and perhaps the largest current of centrists around the world, the United Secretariat of the Fourth International (USec), is on the verge of finally ending its pretence of adhering to the conception and program of Trotskyism. This step will put the seal of approval on the actual practice of most of its followers  blending indistinguishably into the left reform wing of social democracy.
A pioneer effort in the current turn was made by the International Socialist Movement in Scotland, a group which has now left the Committee for a Workers International (CWI), the former Militant Tendency. It launched the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP), a mild-left organization which enlisted under the banner of nationalism and the electoral road to power and has won a seat in the new Scottish parliament. The Scottish followers of the late Tony Cliff and the British Socialist Workers Party (SWP) have already dissolved into this new party.
In England and Wales, the SWP is playing the major role in the Socialist Alliance, an electoral pre-party bloc which counterposed itself to Tony Blair’s New Labour Party in the June 2001 parliamentary election. Along with the SWP, the bloc includes the bulk of the centrist left: the Workers Liberty group, the ex-Stalinist Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB, publishers of the Weekly Worker), Workers Power (the leading section of the LRCI, the League for a Revolutionary Communist International), the USec’s International Socialist Group (publishing Socialist Outlook) and smaller formations. The CWI’s Socialist Party maintains a half-in, half-out relationship to the SA at the moment, although its basic political differences are merely tactical. [For more on the Socialist Alliance, see Left Flops in British Election.]
The British miners’ leader Arthur Scargill had made an earlier attempt to forge an alternative reformist party by forming the Socialist Labour Party (SLP) for the 1997 parliamentary election. Today it remains as a rival electoral outfit vying with the newer SA, equally reformist but with a Stalinist tinge. [For more on the SLP and its far-left supporters, see Spartacists Cross Their “Crude Class Line”.]
In Germany, elements of the far left, notably friends of the USec and the LRCI section, initially gravitated toward Gregor Gysi’s not-so-left ex-Stalinist party, the Partei des Demokratischen Sozialismus (PDS). But the PDS became overtly capitulationist so quickly that most of the far leftists have already fallen away, awaiting a less odiferous reformist formation. In France, Lutte Ouvrière intermittently calls for a new workers party on a vague programmatic basis, while the USec’s leading section, the Ligue Communiste Revolutionnaire, tops that with a more concerted drive for a new radical populist party. In the European Union, a variety of centrist groups are attempting to form some sort of common party based on a non-revolutionary program.
In Australia, the new Socialist Alliance modeled on the British example includes the ex-USec and pro-Stalinist Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), the Cliffite International Socialist Organization, the Freedom Socialist Party, the Australian branch of the Worker-Communist Party of Iraq, Workers Power (of LRCI), Socialist Democracy and the unofficial Cliffites of Socialist Alternative. In Canada, a number of centrist and green groups are likewise discussing the formation of a new reformist or populist bloc or party. The rightward leap by the traditional reformist labor party, the New Democratic Party, has left its decimated left wing in even more of a state of befuddlement than usual. And in the U.S. a few years ago, a medley of union bureaucrats, aided by far leftists, formed the so-called Labor Party, which waits in the wings without running candidates (while its leaders continue to support the bourgeois Democrats)  in the hope of corralling any future break by workers away from the Democratic Party.
Sections of the South African left who recently pushed the Workers List as a reformist electoral front have not given up on such attempts, despite the lack of interest on the part of the large revolutionary-minded section of the proletariat. And, although much of its former allure has already been fading, an older attempt  the Brazilian Workers Party led by Lula  has continued to enthrall many centrist organizations in Latin America and elsewhere.
Open Class Collaboration
Reformism by its nature means class collaboration, so the centrists’ turn is not limited to re-creating reformist organizations that are nominally in the working class. In South Africa, the dominant class collaborationist road has been expressed by the fervent support given by left groups to the popular front government led by the bourgeois African National Congress and the Stalinist-reformist Communist Party. In Indonesia, the Peoples Democratic Party (PRD), which in the past had pursued a popular frontist line through support to Megawati Sukarnoputri, now appears to have switched support to the equally bourgeois recently ousted president, Abdurrahman Wahid. In this it has been supported by the Australian DSP.
In England, the lunge to the right did not halt with the creation of the Socialist Alliance; the mayoral election in 2000 saw the same centrists support Ken Livingstone and his overtly popular frontist campaign. In the U.S., the now-expelled Cliffites in the International Socialist Organization (ISO), as well as the CWI’s Socialist Alternative, endorsed and vigorously pushed the liberal populist campaign waged by Ralph Nader and the middle-class greens. In Zimbabwe, the Cliffites have outdone themselves in burying the class line. They joined, ran on a common electoral slate with and gave a left cover to the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). The creation of the MDC was initiated by the trade unions, but it was completely taken over by pro-capitalist bureaucrats and politicians who made sure that the party has no organizational links with the unions and is free to be the mouthpiece of the big urban capitalists and white landowners  all of which the ISO(Zim) admits!
The model for the British Socialist Alliance is the Italian Rifondazione Comunista, which has already proved that new reformist parties are no alternative to old ones. In parliament, Rifondazione voted in 1995 for the prime minister’s austerity program and thereby saved his bourgeois government. After that it supported the popular-frontist Olive Tree coalition, which instituted an austerity program against the workers. USec leader Livio Maitan is in the leadership of Rifondazione, and members of the centrist International Trotskyist Opposition (publishers of Proposta) have also been inside it as an organized tendency.
In Ukraine, the phony Trotskyists in the CWI-affiliated Rabotnichii Sprotiv (Workers Resistance) found themselves in the National Salvation Forum (NSF), the bourgeois opposition bloc supporting the then-Prime Minister Yushchenko. This would have been bad enough even if the NSF didn’t include an organization of fascists. The LRCI’s fraternal affiliate, Robitnychya Vlad/Molodiye Revolutioniye Marksisty (Workers Power/Young Revolutionary Marxists), has called the NSF progressive but has not yet joined it.
Historic Betrayals
The new right turn is of course not the first in the history of the socialist left. At the dawn of the 20th century, social democracy appeared within the workers’ movement preaching the utopian lie that capitalism could be reformed and made humane through class collaboration. This was a world-historic betrayal which led to support for the first intra-imperialist world war and bloody fratricide for the international working class.
After the Bolshevik revolution, the social democratic fraud lost much of its appeal for an increasingly revolutionary proletariat around the world. With the isolation of the revolution and the growth of Stalinism, reformism and class collaboration was dressed up as the “popular front” by the new betrayers. This subordination of working-class independence was the next world-historic betrayal, one which contributed to successful counterrevolution in the USSR, paved the way for fascism and boosted support for the second world imperialist war. For nearly seventy years since the mid-1930’s, the Stalinist Communist parties have promulgated the ideology of class-collaborationism in the form of populism and popular frontism.
Today’s turn is another world-historic act of class treason. No one should be fooled by the fact that the perpetrators are still centrists vacillating between reformism and revolution rather than forces which have already proven themselves to be counterrevolutionary. If their present turn to the right is not halted, they are fated to attain that criminal goal.
We also cannot be fooled by the fact that the forces of international centrism are now comparatively small and still divided. The profound and deepening crisis of capitalism is beginning again to powerfully regenerate potentially revolutionary working class upheavals and mass strikes in country after country around the world. However, as a result of the devastation wrought by social democracy and Stalinism, advanced consciousness within the international working class is still weak, fragile and very susceptible to political corruption. And centrism, for all its present lack of size and power, has its greatest negative impact among the vanguard workers and communist-minded militants in many countries.
As the struggles accelerate and consciousness grows, centrists will be capable of misleading far more decisive sectors of workers than those who follow them today. They are creating pre-emptive political traps which could serve as a serious barrier to the re-formation of the world party of socialist revolution.
Conditions Behind the Turn
During the post-World War II period of prosperity, social democracy and Stalinism gained and maintained strength within the working class in many countries. Capitalism in the form of imperialism was able to grant enough concessions to give a material stake in the preservation of the system to significant sectors of the working class. The labor aristocracy and the bureaucratic technical and professional middle classes grew. Under such conditions, reforms won by mass struggles and the threat of revolution were used to promote the dual ideology of reformism and multi-class populism.
As the profound economic and social crisis of the system returned to the surface in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, proletarian upheavals and massive general strikes erupted around the globe. The Socialist, Communist and Labour parties tried to derail the workers’ struggles. Despite their temporary success, the cynicism they left in their wake contributed heavily to the steady decline in their ability to actually control the mass of workers. During the upheavals, the centrists, facing masses in motion and potentially revolutionary situations, talked more left but fundamentally adapted to the reformist and radical middle-class forces and failed to provide an alternative communist pole of attraction. In the aftermath, while centrism had gained in numbers as a result of revolutionary rhetoric, it could not displace the old decrepit reformist parties.
The thwarting of revolution did not end the mortal contradictions facing the world’s rulers. Stalinist East Europe and the USSR itself were the first to explode under the impact of economic collapse and the massive renewal of proletarian uprisings in the 1980’s. Even though the revolutions were hijacked by bourgeois pro-Western forces, the demise of Stalinism in the East qualitatively accelerated the decline of the reformist CP’s inside the workers’ movement in the rest of the world.
The crisis of capitalism was already eating away at past gains made by the working class in the advanced Western imperialist sector as well as the former colonial and semi-colonial world. The labor aristocracy and middle classes were slowly disintegrating, as handfuls blended into the bourgeoisie but the bulk were forced into the lower-paid working class or even more devastated strata. The Stalinist collapse accelerated the decay of whatever was left of the residual loyalty the Communist parties had still commanded among their former followers in the working class in some countries. Reformist parties retained their electoral strength but rarely kept even a vestige of the committed support they once enjoyed. And, among the most militant elements and the more conscious vanguard sectors, contempt for the reformists escalated.
As the crisis deepened and the working class in the West began stirring again, the traditional reformist statesmen began to ditch even their past paper-thin claim to “socialism” and the working class. The absence of a strongly organized revolutionary alternative convinced the labor potentates that they could move even further rightward toward open liberalism and middle-class voters without losing too many working-class votes. At the same time, as the economic crisis deepens and the working class gives every sign of renewing its mass struggles in growing areas of the world, these reformist leaders also see the looming danger on the horizon. Thus they gravitate even more closely to the power of the big bourgeoisie.
The closeness of the ties between the British Labour Party’s Blair and the U.S. Democrat Clinton demonstrate that the rightward turn of the old dominant reformists has virtually eliminated the remaining policy distinctions they once claimed with respect to open liberal bourgeois ideology. In fact, they move toward overt liberalism at the very moment when that liberalism itself is conservatizing. Thus a vacuum has been created on the reformist left, which has drawn the fascinated attention of the centrists. Hence the dawn of the new “socialist” electoral formations and electoral blocs which combine centrists with bewildered left Labourites as well as the middle-class radical Greens and other pro-bourgeois elements. The pseudo-revolutionaries are now exploring different forms as they try to create new “socialist” institutions to replace the departing former leaders.
“Revolutionary” Doublespeak
In making their turn, the various centrists are engaging in what George Orwell called “doublespeak.” They use the term “socialist” to describe the new blocs they are forming, in order to justify burying their own supposedly revolutionary program in favor of proposals that won’t trouble mild-left reformists. And, just to be sure that their new programs do not offend reformists or populists, they use the “s-word” (and above all the “r-word”) as rarely as possible when listing their demands. Echoing the Stalinists’ time-honored class-collaborationist propaganda for popular fronts and “people’s democracy,” they increasingly stress the supposed progressiveness of populism.
Further, they employ classless terms like “anti-capitalist” to describe the growing protests against the global economy. These demonstrations are important but are multi-class in composition. They attract people who are not yet politically aware along with anarchists, liberals, radical middle-class environmentalists, arch-nationalists, back-to-nature proponents, trade unionists, subjective revolutionaries and real revolutionaries. They are led most often by petty-bourgeois and labor bureaucrats whose answer to global imperialism is a reactionary program rooted in national chauvinism and protectionism.
The mass of activists are still confused and have mixed consciousness; but their fundamental interests and desire to fight world-wide oppression are being betrayed by the misleaders. As Lenin and Trotsky stressed, the reformist outlook of working-class activists can be transitory; but it is permanent for the leaders because it reflects their long-term interest and role in society. That is why it is vital to participate in these joint actions; but at the same time it is necessary to expose the pro-capitalist programs of the liberal and reformist leaders. It is criminal to legitimize the anti-working class betrayers by lumping them with those they betray under the common and outrageously false label of “anti-capitalist.”
The centrists hope to win the “anti-globalization movement” to their new formations. Their aversion to attacking the labor and “progressive” leaders in large part stems from their need to win those elements in order to give bourgeois legitimacy to the blocs. Without the reformist celebrities, the centrists fear that the new alliances stand little chance of being taken seriously and achieving the authenticity they crave.
The Cliffites in particular notoriously refuse to criticize the reformists they work with. So it is ironic that in the SWP’s theoretical journal they quote what they call Trotsky’s “general outline of the united front” in explaining why it is necessary to do precisely what they do not do:
The Communist Party proves to the masses and their organizations its readiness to wage battles in common with them for aims, no matter how modest, so long as they lie on the road of the historical development of the proletariat; the Communist Party in this struggle takes into account the actual condition of the class at each given moment; it turns not only to the masses, but also to those organizations whose leadership is recognized by the masses; it confronts the reformist organizations before the eyes of the masses, with real problems of the class struggle. The policy of the united front hastens the revolutionary development of the class by revealing in the open that the common struggle is undermined not by the disruptive act of the Communist Party but by the conscious sabotage of the leaders of the Social Democracy. (Quoted from The Struggle against Fascism in Germany, in Anti-capitalism, reformism and socialism by John Rees, International Socialism No. 90, Spring 2001.)
Rees comments that “Trotsky was writing about the mass Communist parties and mass reformist parties in the 1930’s, but the same general approach can be applied by much smaller revolutionary organizations today.” Yet the SWP, ISO & Co. often invite onto their platforms union leaders, Labour parliamentarians and other openly reformist speakers  and we can guarantee without hesitancy that they have not once revealed the “conscious sabotage” of the workers’ struggle by their “united front” partners. That is because the Socialist Alliances are not genuine united fronts, which are agreements for common action, but propaganda blocs among people who have held different programs, in which alleged revolutionaries subordinate their programs to those of their reformist partners.
The Revolutionary Tail
Perhaps the most corrupt attempt to revitalize reformism is that put forward by groups like the CPGB and Workers Power in Britain which see themselves as the far left of the movement. They do all they can to build the reformist formations, cheerlead their electoral efforts  and justify all this by claiming that they are trying to win the blocs to a revolutionary program. Of course, they will never convince the open reformist leaders to accept their program; hence they will never convince their fellow opportunists in the rest of the far left. If there were any chance that they would actually succeed, that would defeat the whole purpose of the turn and mean the death of the rotten blocs. Therefore, once their diplomatically proposed slogans are safely defeated, they breathe a sigh of relief and join wholeheartedly in the reformist electoral game. Their “transitional” or “revolutionary” interventions are a pretense, sadly fooling their adherents  and even themselves  that they are really acting as Bolsheviks.
Workers Power in particular claims that its method is that of Trotsky’s Transitional Program. But the Transitional Program was an open attack on reformism, not an attempt to cover it as a left tail.
To see how false these claims are, consider the question of a Labor Party in the United States in the late 1930’s, an example where Trotskyists did support the formation of a new class party not committed to communism from the start. Trotsky’s advocacy of a labor party was based on the fact that the mass class struggle had exhausted itself on the industrial and economic level and would have to move toward a political confrontation with the bourgeois state. He predicted that a workers’ movement would develop, demanding an independent party based on the proven militancy of the new CIO unions. The mass of workers would not, at that point, come directly to the small and relatively weak revolutionary organization. Rather they saw the strength they needed as coming from the big, fighting unions.
Under such circumstances it would have been stupidly sectarian to counterpose the small vanguard party to the huge class party workers sought. Moreover, the program of the party the movement would produce  reformist or revolutionary  was not pre-ordained. The Trotskyists agreed with their working-class brothers and sisters on the need for a mass party of their class, but they counterposed appropriate transitional demands to the reformist program of the labor and Stalinist misleaders.
The labor party demand was designed as a hostile challenge to put the CIO leadership on the spot in front of the mass of fighting workers who had illusions in the leaders’ commitment to independence and militancy. It was meant to force the reformist labor bureaucrats to break with the Democratic Party and take state power  or else stand exposed as the fakers that the revolutionaries openly insisted that they were.
Trotsky stated explicitly that the program they stood for could only be carried out by a revolutionary workers’ party. “It would be absurd to say that we advocate a reformist party.” That was the aim of the Stalinists and their ilk.
The Transitional Program was rooted in the idea that workers would increasingly come to understand their fundamental material interests in the course of class struggle. As Trotsky detailed, struggle by itself can produce backward as well as advanced consciousness; the key for communist success is that the vanguard workers’ party truthfully point out the revolutionary lessons in contrast to counterrevolutionary reformist deceits. “Why not say openly what is? Without any camouflage, without any diplomacy.”
In contrast, Workers Power suggests that the SA should adopt transitional demands like state expropriation of industry without compensation. Naturally, given the material and ideological power of capitalism, the mass of workers attracted to such a measure will initially demand it of the existing state rather than immediately opting for socialist revolution. In going through a common struggle, revolutionaries can show that only the revolutionary party can carry out such programs through the overthrow of the bourgeois state. By not insisting that their program requires revolution and the communist party, Workers Power helps the reformist and pro-reformist leaders perpetrate utopian illusions in the capitalist state.
One difference between Trotsky’s method and today’s centrists’ is that Trotsky’s proposed Labor Party was based on an existing, massive working-class struggle  whose victories and obstacles would help the authentic communists convince many workers that a revolutionary program was the only road forward. The Socialist Alliances today do not reflect proletarian strength and struggle in the minds of the workers. They appear as leftish versions of the present labor parties. But they are decidedly inferior to those reformist parties in that they are clearly too weak to change the present ominous situation. In Britain, industrial strike action has been at a very low ebb. In Australia it has been stronger, but still the strike weapon has hardly been exhausted. The working class has not yet wielded its potential for united action and enormous power in either country. Consequently the SA’s can only divert advanced revolutionary-minded workers without reaching the mass of our class. They are pre-emptive formations designed to trap and tame future mass working-class-led upheavals.
In such situations, authentic revolutionaries fight for the general strike as the means for translating the coming mass struggles into a political confrontation with the bourgeois state. The general strike is a weapon most useful when the class leadership is weak and the masses do not yet realize the power they can have in unified action. Once our class recognizes its power, all things are possible.
At this time, neither the so-called “anti-capitalist movement” nor the struggles of the working class have been successfully channelled toward the new reformist formations. But it is not for the centrists’ lack of trying. The Cliffites and the other major players already refrain from raising “far out” demands or challenging the reformist leaders. When the coming mass explosions mature, Workers Power and like-minded further left groups will lose their ability to raise the kind of radical demands that scare off their reformist playmates. Hopefully the subjective dedication of some of their followers will enable them to break free from those organizations and their role as left tails on the reformist kite.
It is telling that neither the SWP, nor its far-left allies that assert their Trotskyism more loudly, like to cite what Trotsky always said about electoral blocs. For example:
The Bolsheviks did conclude practical agreements with the revolutionary petty-bourgeois organizations.... During the elections to the state Duma, they did, under certain conditions, enter into electoral blocs with the Mensheviks or the Social Revolutionaries on the second ballot. That is all. No common “programs,” no common and permanent institutions, no renunciation of the criticism of temporary allies. Such episodic agreements and compromises [were] confined strictly to practical aims  and Lenin never spoke of any other kind.... (Leon Trotsky on France, p. 146.)
Or, as Trotsky had said about the bloc he urged the German Communists to form with the Social Democrats to stop Hitler:
No common platform with the Social Democracy, or with the leaders of the German trade unions, no common publications, banners, placards! March separately, but strike together! Agree only on how to strike, whom to strike, and when to strike! (The Struggle Against Fascism in Germany, pp. 138-9.)
Contrast this with the SWP’s burying itself inside the Scottish Socialist Party and with Workers Power and the CPGB calling for their Socialist Alliance to be a permanent “revolutionary” party.
Precedents For the New Turn
The scope of the centrists’ present turn is qualitatively greater than anything they have done in the recent past. We note, however, that many of the pseudo-Trotskyist currents have crossed the class line before, as if in preparation for today. Here are some major examples:

The overwhelming majority of groups who claim the heritage of Trotskyism still support the concept of “deformed workers’ states”  that is, they believe that proletarian states were achieved without working-class-led revolutions. Further, since these states in Eastern Europe and East Asia were formed and led by Communist Parties, ruling openly in class collaborationist blocs with bourgeois elements, the “orthodox Trotskyist” conception in fact means that socialist revolutions can be made by popular fronts.
In the late 1940’s, virtually all varieties of pseudo-Trotskyists favored deep entry into the right-moving social democratic and/or Stalinist parties. In sharp contrast to Trotsky’s entry strategy in the 1930’s, this was not an attempt to break left-moving workers from their reformist misleaders, but an endorsement of illusions in the supposedly progressive  if too moderate  character of those parties.
In 1952, the Trotskyist POR in Bolivia, a significant political force, actively supported the left bourgeois nationalists during the revolution in that country, thereby helping to doom a major proletarian upheaval. No leadership body within the degenerating Trotskyist Fourth International uttered even a peep of opposition to this overt act of class capitulation. Shortly afterward, the Ceylonese Trotskyists joined their bourgeois government. Even though the FI’s embarrassed leadership had to oppose this blatant act, it was a product of their method.
During the 1960’s, the pseudo-Trotskyist milieu was rife with organizations which saw the student milieu as the revolutionary vanguard in place of the urban proletariat. They also awarded that role to peasant-based guerrilla struggles in a number of countries. Thus they helped detour not only the potential proletarian revolution but also the liberation of the peasantry, whose only chance could come through working-class leadership.

The historical repetition of past betrayals, today by purported Trotskyists, does not fundamentally come as a result of multiple conspiracies or the abundance of bad ideas. As Lenin and Trotsky taught us, such serious transgressions can only be caused materially  that is, by the invasion of petty bourgeois and middle-class interests into the workers’ movement. In our opinion, therefore, it is no accident that the overwhelming majority of those groups who call themselves Bolshevik-Leninist today blatantly disagree with the view explicitly stated by Marx, Lenin (after 1905) and Trotsky  that the working class itself achieves its own revolutionary socialist class consciousness. Instead, they claim that such consciousness must be imported from the middle-class intelligentsia.
This anti-Marxist and anti-proletarian view reflects the fact that during the period of post-World War II prosperity, the rampant growth of the middle class and the labor aristocracy around the world not only reinvigorated reformism for that time, but invaded the ranks of the Trotskyist Fourth International itself. Not only did this provide the basis for the new leadership which corrupted and destroyed the revolutionary program and politics of the FI by the mid-1950’s, it steered that leadership into its capitulatory adaptations to the reformists.
What Is To Be Done
The liberation of the proletariat is the task of the proletariat itself; it is a task it must carry out in opposition to middle class “condescending saviors.” Building the revolutionary party is still the key communist slogan. Pushing for reformist electoral blocs and parties now is not only counterposed to the central task of building the revolutionary party, it is also counterposed to the struggle for mass action.
Unity in action is vital for the working class and its allies. In the coming period, revolutionaries will struggle not only for the general strike and other mass actions but will raise the proletarian united front as a battle cry. Once again the idea that the working class must lead all the dispossessed and the oppressed in their struggles will become the outlook of millions of fighters.
Communists “say what is”: reformism is not a moderate or too slow form of socialism, but its mortal, counterrevolutionary enemy. It is an enemy of whatever genuine reforms can still be achieved, since they can only come as a result of mass action and the threat of revolution. In contrast to the rightward moving centrists and their attempt to breathe life into the rotting corpses of reformism and populism, working-class communists stand openly for socialism and proletarian revolution. Even when circumstances call for tactical blocs with reformist parties, we openly warn of their treachery and criticize their leaderships. At every turn, we insist on the necessity of re-creating the communist vanguard party  in contrast to all calls for new reformist, radical and green parties. The chief task facing the proletariat today is the re-creation of the authentic Fourth International!

ules: The Fraud of U.S. Democracy








Racism Rules: The Fraud of U.S. Democracy


The following article was published in  Proletarian Revolution, No. 62 (Winter 2001). Further coverage of the U.S. election is available in the hard-copy edition of the magazine, including an article on the Ralph Nader campaign and polemics against “socialists” such as the ISO or Socialist Alternative who supported Nader.

Racism Rules: The Fraud of U.S. Democracy
"The System Works.” The U.S. ruling class breathed a collective sigh of relief when Al Gore conceded the presidency to George W. Bush. There would be no more “prolonged agony,” no more indecision—above all no mass protest.
Yes, their system worked. Tens of thousands of Black people and others were denied their right to vote, but this didnt stop the Republican Supreme Court, backed by the Republican administration and legislature of Florida and the Republican Congress, from stepping in to decree Bush the president. And the Democrats went along, with minimal complaint.
Preserving the “rule of law”—however unlawful—was the priority. As Chief Justice Rehnquist bluntly put it, when it comes to the presidency “there is no right of suffrage”—the Constitution says almost literally that the ruling class shall choose the president, not the common people. And as Justice Scalia accurately pointed out, counting all the votes would indeed have meant “casting a cloud on what [Bush] claims to be the legitimacy of his election,” since counting votes “is not a recipe for producing election results that have the public acceptance democratic stability requires.”
That is indeed how the electoral system works. It was designed in the 18th century as a compromise between Northern capitalists and Southern slaveowners. (See  below for more on this history.) Today its methods include not just official fraud so prevalent in Florida (and elsewhere), but an array of tricks to keep working-class voters, mainly Black, from voting: police roadblocks in Black neighborhoods, false criminal accusations, “lost” registrations, missing ballot boxes, early poll closings, unavailable interpreters for Haitian and Puerto Rican voters, and much more.
This time, however, there was a major glitch. The electoral squabble threatened U.S. imperialisms international prestige, and more. The specter of thousands of Black people taking to the street to denounce their disenfranchisement could have sparked a deeper and bigger movement against the racist system.
The five-week legal and political conflict over Florida attracted far more interest than the interminable pre-election race between two barely distinguishable candidates—because it exposed a good part of the dirt that American “law and order” rests on. The revelations about racism, fraud and judicial bias were undermining regard for bourgeois legality and exposing the capitalist class power that hides behind the facade of democracy.
Democrats Betrayal
But where was the outrage? Among Blacks, voters and non-voters alike, there was plenty. Some Democratic politicians and journalists howled out of partisan pain. But the Democratic Party as a whole played its traditional role. Black leaders like Jesse Jackson and labor leaders like John Sweeney obediently called off the protest rallies they had planned when Bush won the initial Florida count by a few hundred votes. Then they sat by quietly when Gore insisted on downplaying racism in favor of a focus on electoral technicalities and waging only a legal and public relations campaign. When Gores “fight” failed and the Supreme Court stopped the count, Sweeney and Jackson came up with feeble “Count Every Vote” marches—too little and far too late.
Jackson, according to the January 2 Village Voice, had been ordered to make peace with Bush by Wall Street financial backers of his Rainbow-Push Coalition. He telephoned Bush to “heal the nation and bring it together”—a far cry from Jacksons previous declarations that he rejected Bushs legitimacy “with every bone in my body and every ounce of moral strength in my soul.” Thus he carried out his class interests, selling out the rights of working-class Black voters. Even the most liberal Democratic Party leaders preferred to surrender their chance to win rather than encourage a mass struggle for democratic rights.
The final insult came on January 6, when Congress met to ratify the Electoral College vote. Not one Democratic Senator out of the 50, not even one of the handful of so-called progressives, decided to support the Congressional Black Caucuss challenge to Floridas electors. Of course, the Black Caucus members will show the limits to their principles by sticking with the Democratic Party that once again betrayed their constituents.
Marxist View of the Capitalist State
In dramatic fashion, the electoral farce has affirmed the Marxist understanding that bourgeois democracy masks the dictatorship of the capitalist class over the workers. While the contests between Democrats and Republicans reflect differences within the ruling class, the two parties are united in defending the interests of the capitalist bosses at the expense of the working class.
As working-class socialists, we supported no bourgeois side in this election. Voting for Democrats or Republicans means supporting both parties attacks against the working class and especially its most oppressed layers.
Moreover, the interests of the working class cannot be won through elections. The working class cannot gain state power through elections. Even when working-class or “socialist” parties are voted into office, the state remains capitalist as the bourgeoisie retains control over the apparatus of repression—the army, courts, police, etc. A fight for the real interests of workers requires mass struggle to smash the capitalist state. It means the building of a revolutionary party to lead the fight for socialist revolution and the creation of a workers state based on proletarian democracy.
For all the heat generated by the competing parties in the post-election squabbling, for weeks the wiser heads in the ruling class were able to treat the whole affair with relative detachment: in the end it did not really much matter to them who won. Compare 1992: then, Bush the Elders inability to soothe the anger that sparked the Los Angeles “riot” drove ruling-class opinion to Clintons side. This time the bourgeoisie saw no immediate cause for worry, and neither candidate stood out as a significantly better bet for the capitalists. That is a major reason for the near-tie vote.
The electoral standoff could only have taken place because of the low level of organized class struggle on the U.S. scene—along with the absence of any powerful challenger to Americas predominant imperialist position. Had the bourgeoisie felt that their state power was in any way threatened, cooler heads would have prevailed and compelled one or another of the contenders to concede without further fight. But they figured their Jacksons and Sweeneys would be enough of a border guard against unrest.
Bourgeois democracy in reality means the dictatorship of the capitalist class over the working class and all oppressed peoples, with only the slightest veneer of mass participation. The “democracy” so proudly hailed in the U.S. keeps elections safe for capitalism by insuring that only the super-rich and those backed by giant corporations get to compete. And when that isnt enough, the state authority steps in with methods lawful and unlawful.
Both bourgeois parties violate their own election laws and engage in obscene spending orgies to win office. In the 1996 presidential race, Clinton and Gore beat the Republican crooks at their own game, breaking laws that would get any ordinary government worker fired in a second. In contrast, Teamsters president Ron Carey was booted from office for electoral improprieties (involving illegal funds going to the Clinton campaign) that pale in comparison.
This year Florida revealed how the electoral machinery down to the grassroots level is controlled by flunkies from both parties. Across the country, Democrats and Republicans in every state control the ballots, the vote counting process, registration, the ability to get on the ballot, etc. Gore and the Democrats worked hand-in-hand with the Republicans to keep Ralph Nader out of the televised presidential debates. In Democratic-controlled districts, they screw Republicans, and the Republicans do the same where they rule. And they join together to screw everyone else.
Democrats Sell Out Their Voters
Thanks to the dogfight in Florida, the corrupt nature of the U.S. electoral system has been bared before the eyes of the working class here and internationally. The evidence points to the conclusion that Gore would have won Florida and the presidency if all who tried to vote had been allowed to do so and had their votes counted. But the Democrats ignored the fact that tens of thousands were denied the vote, concentrating only on voters whose votes never got counted.
Gore, like Bush, is a loyal member—and servant—of the capitalist class. But the Democrats, unlike the Republicans, rest on a base of Black voters and organized labor. That is why Gore had to be more careful than Bush in waging the post-electoral battle—mobilizing his constituencies can easily get “out of control” and encourage struggles that will threaten the capitalist system. Thus Republicans could organize a “bourgeois riot” by their hired operatives to stop the recount in Miami. But the Democrats had to ensure that their protests were first peaceful and then non-existent.
This sellout was nothing new. The Democratic Party under Clinton and Gore has taken the side of the bosses and racists against the workers and the oppressed in myriad ways—welfare “reform,” NAFTA, the health care debacle, the “three strikes” crime bill, new anti-immigrant laws, keeping the U.S. military in Puerto Rico, doubling the prison population, the “effective death penalty” act and putting even more cops on the street to intimidate people of color and the poor. It is not only “Governor Death” Bush who has committed murder in the name of the death penalty; Gore, like Clinton, also championed state killing as he challenged Bush for the racist law-and-order vote.
The unquestioning support of the Democrats by labor leaders as well as Black and Latino leaders is exactly the reason Clinton/Gore have gotten away with all of their attacks on workers and oppressed peoples. For all the reactionary rhetoric of Reagan and Bush the First, even they never dared to dismantle the welfare system and impose “workfare” to undermine union jobs. They feared the protests that such moves would unleash. But Clinton got away with it because the leaders of the mass organizations were committed to supporting him for re-election no matter what—and therefore committed to preventing mass action. Far from being the “lesser evil” for workers, for the past eight years the Democrats have been the greater evil that was capable of forcing anti-worker attacks down our throats.
The crimes of the Clinton administration extend far beyond attacks on workers in the U.S. They have repeatedly used the repressive might of both the U.S. military and economic dominance to bully nations all over the world. They have bombed Serbia, Iraq, the Sudan and Afghanistan. The embargo on Iraq alone has resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths. IMF domination of economies in Latin America, Asia and Africa is deadly to workers and oppressed peoples.
Gore and the Black Vote
Given the unappealing choices available, half the electorate remains too disgusted or demoralized to bother voting at all. But this year 51 percent of eligible Blacks voted, up from 48 percent last time. Many Black people who had never voted before went to the polls this time, believing they had a real stake in this election.
Why is this? With the supposed economic “boom” now fraying at the edges, many Black people—both working-class and better-off—are becoming aware that their economic and political gains are precarious in this racist society. And the rabid impeachment campaign against Clinton impelled by the far-right-led Congress in 1998 made the Republicans look even more threatening to Black rights. There was also a concerted registration drive by Democratic strategists, who saw that Blacks would be the most reliable voting base for Gore. Special efforts were made in key states like Florida.
Nationwide 90 percent of Black voters chose Gore, as did 63 percent of Latinos and 62 percent of union members. (The latter figure is due to the 25 percent Black and the growing Latino presence in the unions, since only a bare majority of white unionists went for Gore.) Non-union white workers who voted, as far as can be determined, preferred Bush by a small margin.
In Florida, 94 percent of Black voters supported Gore. The Black turnout leaped from 10 percent of all voters in 1996 to 16 percent—an increase of 350,000. (Blacks are 13 percent of the voting-age population.) A top reason was anger at Governor Jeb Bush, who had moved to end affirmative action in the state. Last March, 50,000 people rallied against Bushs moves, the largest civil rights protest in Florida history.
But because of the racist exclusions, 16 percent of the ballots cast in majority-Black Florida precincts were thrown out, more than twice the percentage thrown out from white precincts. Worst was Duval County, which contains the city of Jacksonville and a large poor and working-class Black population: in some Black precincts there, 30 percent of ballots were excluded.
Ironically, Gores failure to win Florida decisively was the fault not just of vote fraud (or of Ralph Nader, as some Democrats claim), but of the racist “law and order” policies strengthened by the Clinton/Gore administration. Florida is one of nine states that bar convicted felons from voting for life; this law permanently disenfranchises about 14 percent of Floridas Black residents, 31 percent of the states Black men. Tens of thousands of Blacks in Florida who might have voted for Gore were barred from the polls because Clinton/Gore policies put them in jail.
Tragically, many Black workers, as well as Latino and white, were misled into supporting Gore despite the fact that he represents the enemy class—as the Democratic Partys record demonstrates. The Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) that Gore, Clinton and Lieberman all belong to has turned the Democratic Party to the right and downplayed even mild reforms against racial injustice along with its assaults against the working class.
In this election, the DLC aimed to recapture the once solidly Democratic racist vote in the South, but this strategy failed miserably: Gore won not a single Southern state outside of Florida. The regions Gore won nationally are the strongholds of the working class and above all of Blacks. Indeed, it is only the Black vote that keeps the Democratic Party alive on a national level. Rarely have so many been betrayed by so few.
Break from the Democrats!
The bourgeoisies electoral crisis highlights the crisis of leadership facing the working class. It is a crime that the leaders of our class allowed thousands of workers votes to be stolen without mobilizing massive outrage. Workers now face threats from both ruling-class parties as Bush continues Clintons assault on the most vulnerable layers of our class. Bush is likely also to look for a military intervention abroad, in an effort to gain the “legitimacy” he couldnt win in the election. The liberals, with their party out of power, will adopt a leftish posture and claim that the only way to stop Bushs attacks is to vote Democratic in 2002. This will be the stock answer of union bureaucrats, community leaders and the like, when they are looking to avoid real struggles. It will be a central task of revolutionaries to try to guide struggles away from the Democratic Party electoral trap and toward mass confrontation with the ruling class.
Many Black and Latino workers understand that the outright fraud in the 2000 election was not an aberration but was inherent in a racist, undemocratic system. Certainly white workers also developed greater contempt for the whole process, but far too few opposed the racist exclusions.
Capitalism is a decadent system that offers no future for workers of any color. Black workers in this country, already pushed to the wall by racist and class attacks, have the capacity to play a leading role in the development of communist consciousness in our class. The fact that racism and exploitation are so interrelated makes it necessary and possible for this consciousness to develop, and it will if a vanguard takes the lead.
A key step would be a sharp break from sellouts like Jesse Jackson and a turn toward massive explosive action like general strikes against the capitalist attacks. In Los Angeles in 1992, when pro-capitalist misleaders like Jackson and Minister Farrakhan tried to quell the rebellion, they were disregarded by the masses, led in large part by youth. Had there been even a small revolutionary nucleus on the scene in Florida, there would have been a real chance for mass action linking the disenfranchisement of American Blacks, Haitians and Puerto Ricans to the overall attacks on the oppressed and the working class.
The Workers Party We Need
There was no choice for workers in this election. As our accompanying article on the Ralph Nader campaign shows, a third bourgeois party is no answer either. But there was also no revolutionary party to offer a real alternative.
In going to the voting booth in greater numbers, Black workers recognized that a political answer is necessary to the growing threats. That they, along with other workers, could be misled again into the Democratic Party trap is the responsibility of the misleaders of all colors who teach that workers have no power and must rely on either benevolent saviors or so-called lesser evils.
Likewise, the many Black, Latino and white workers who sneer at the capitalist parties and therefore the voting booth also have found no real answer to powerlessness and desperation. Political attacks from the ruling class do require a political response. Unless we form a working-class political party we are accepting the rule of the capitalist parties.
Workers and all people of color do have a stake in the struggle for democratic rights, including the right to vote. While the working class cannot attain power through bourgeois-democratic means, working people must make use of democratic rights under capitalism to build their own organizations of struggle: the trade unions, organizations of the oppressed—and most of all, the revolutionary party. Revolutionaries always join our brothers and sisters in struggles to defend democratic rights. In doing so we point to the ability of the working class to bring down this wretched system of exploitation, oppression and sham democracy. It is vital therefore that revolutionary workers and youth join protests like the counter-inaugural rallies in Washington this January 20—both to challenge the electoral fraud and to fight the illusions in the out-of-power Democratic Party that the demonstration leaders will inevitably push.
The working class needs a political alternative that meets the needs of our class and a strategy based on our classs power. Our strength is not in the bourgeoisies elections but in collective struggle. Most essentially it is in the power of the working class to run the economy and to shut the profit-making system down. We need a workers party that can offer leadership to every struggle in order to win workers and the oppressed to revolutionary consciousness. Such a party will be dedicated to overthrowing both the capitalist economic system and the state that defends it. It will be a revolutionary socialist vanguard party of the working class.
Masses of workers and the oppressed will not join such a party today. But small numbers of workers and youth already see the need to get rid of capitalism; they must begin to build such a party now. The League for the Revolutionary Party fights for this goal today. More must join us if we are to win greater numbers of workers and youth to our banner tomorrow.

Racism Still Rules the Constitution
Gore won the national popular vote by about half a million, while Bush was awarded a majority of the Electoral College that actually elects the president. This contradiction brings out the built-in anti-democratic structure inscribed in the U.S. constitution, of which the Electoral College is not even the worst.
From the beginning, voting qualifications and procedures have been a matter of states’ rights. Not only did most states limit voting to white men who owned property; some states even required voters to belong to a particular religious group. The system has only conceded voting rights to masses as a result of struggles. In Rhode Island, one of the last states to grant the right to vote to all white males, it took an armed attack on the state capital before universal white male suffrage was enacted. Black males only gained the right to vote with the Fifteenth Amendment, added to the Constitution in 1870, while women gained full voting rights in 1920 with the 19th Amendment. Nevertheless, Blacks were denied the vote through Jim Crow laws and Ku Klux Klan terror. Even with the legal gains in the 1960’s as a result of the mass Civil Rights struggle, intimidation continues—as Florida demonstrates.
The Electoral College was initially established for two reasons. One was to add voting strength to the Southern slave states: Black slaves counted as “three-fifths of a man” for the purpose of apportioning representatives, even though they counted not at all for voting or any other civil rights. Another reason was to insert an elite layer between the popular vote and the presidency—hence the Supreme Court’s “no right of suffrage.” In theory at least, whatever the popular vote, the electors can overturn the wishes of their constituents, as actually happened more than once in the 19th century.
The three-fifths rule increased the South’s strength in the House of Representatives and lasted until the Civil War. The U.S. Senate is biased even more grossly: each state, no matter how small, gets two senators. This imbalance is carried into the Electoral College, since the states get as many electors as they have senators and representatives together.
The effect this has on presidential elections is complicated. First, since most states require a block vote—that is, all the state’s electoral votes go to the winning candidate even if that candidate won by a narrow margin—a big margin in one state means no more than tiny margins in other states; Gore’s 1.5 million vote lead in New York, for example, could not overcome a deficit of a few hundred in Florida. A candidate who wins narrowly in many states but loses by larger margins in a few big states (as Bush did) can thus become the legal winner.
Second, the College is weighted in favor of small-population states, since it incorporates the Senate’s inequality, even though today the House is apportioned according to population. That tilts the balance of power away from urban states where Blacks and the working class generally are strong, towards the whiter, more rural states. Given that abolishing the Electoral College requires a constitutional amendment, which means ratification by three-quarters of the states, this institution will not be altered peacefully while racism rules in the U.S. It will take a massive upheaval for the bourgeoisie to surrender so useful a tool.
The last time a presidential election was so close in the Electoral College was in 1876. Republican Rutherford Hayes was handed the White House after a deal with the Democrats that promised the white rulers of the Southern states that the last of the Civil War Union troops would be withdrawn from the South, so that the rights that Blacks gained during the revolutionary post-war Reconstruction period could be taken away. The whole history of Jim Crow laws, and the racist brutality that went with them was built on the 1876 precedent.
It is absolutely characteristic of U.S. “democracy” that the 2000 election also turned on the disenfranchisement of Blacks.

The Labor Party in the United States

Socialist Voice No. 6 (Spring 1978)
 Transcribed, Edited and Formatted by Damon Maxwell and David Walters in 2008 for the Encyclopedia of Trotskyism On-Line.
The following article is excerpted from the document “The League in Crisis: Behind the Labor Party Slogan” by Sy Landy and Walter Dahl.
 This document was issued in November 1975 during a faction fight inside the Revolutionary Socialist League (RSL), in response to the majority’s point of view as expressed by Jack Gregory in “The Marxist Approach to the Labor Party and the General Strike.” “League” in the article refers to the RSL. The faction fight resulted in the expulsion of the Revolutionary Party Tendency which then became the League for the Revolutionary Party (LRP); for a full discussion of the dispute, see Socialist Voice No. 1. 
The RSL leadership’s response to this document was to forbid its circulation among the membership, ban any further documents from the minority tendency and then ban the minority itself. The RSL has publicly denied the existence of this document and of course has never replied to it. The document was issued in a limited mimeographed edition at the inception of the LRP. We are giving it a broader circulation now because of the significance of the ideas it presents. In this issue we are publishing (in edited form) the sections of the document on the question of a labor party in the United States; other sections dealing with the importance of the general strike slogan (which we have written about elsewhere) are omitted here.
 
What passes for Trotskyism today is in a sorry state. It is typified by a fetishistic preservation of Trotsky’s words combined with a studious rejection of their revolutionary content. Nowhere is this more true than with the labor party question. The slogan once used by Trotsky in a revolutionary fashion is today used openly to promote reformist politics. The RSL was not alone in this — virtually the entire pseudo-Trotskyist milieu has essential agreement. After the historic struggles of Bolshevism against Menshevism it is hard to believe that a reformist party would be considered a necessary and desirable stepping-stone to socialism by self-professed Bolsheviks, but that is indeed the case today. 
The advocacy of a labor party has become a hallmark of American “Trotskyism” since the Socialist Workers Party adopted the slogan at Trotsky’s urging in 1938. Yet the slogan and its continuing applicability have been subject to little reexamination. Since 1938, through the Second World War, the post-war strike wave, the post-war boom, and now the onset of a new depression — that is through vastly changing circumstances — there has been only a sporadic discussion among those who claim adherence to Trotskyism. The discussion has been sparse not only among the false claimants to the mantle of the Fourth International but among the genuine revolutionists as well. 
The League, from its inception until just yesterday, never subjected the labor party slogan to serious examination. We accepted it as we accepted other concepts because they were part of the heritage of Trotskyism as we understood it. Until well after our last convention, all members of the Political Committee as well as some other leaders of the organization expressed reservations about the slogan. The resolution of views on the subject is very recent, and now the question has become polarized. 
The question is critical for the League. The Central Committee resolution of October states that “a continued emphasis on the Labor Party slogan is central.” A Detroit auto bulletin calls it the trade unions’ “foremost political task now.”The Torch, the industrial bulletins and verbal presentations now far more than in the past make a big push for the labor party. In a Detroit Postal Action Bulletin (November 1975) the two demands on the union officials are
1) Full employment at living wages — JOBS FOR ALL! and 2) Build a political party representing the needs and interests of the working class — FOR A LABOR PARTY! 
The Revolutionary Party Caucus holds that the labor party slogan has been used in a mistaken fashion from the League’s beginning. It is an even more dangerous mistake to use it now as the hub of our work. The slogan for the revolutionary party has to be central and foremost. This question is critical for the League and the maintenance of its revolutionary politics. 
The labor party position in the past was used in a frequently changing manner and never as centrally as now. As we cast off other vestiges of Shachtmanism-Pabloism we could have coped with this one. Now, however, the new-found urgency to beat the drums for the labor party slogan occurs as part of a general right turn (under cover of the necessary deepening of our practical work). It comes as part of a theoretical capitulation to defeatism and fatalism. 
The labor party slogan — the labor party struggle — is under other circumstances and in other times necessary and correct. At this point it means not the advance of the struggle for the revolutionary party but its sidetracking, its postponement to a dimly seen future day. The labor party position and the right turn represent an acceptance of and adaptation to the present level of consciousness of the class, and acceptance of its frustration, its fears, its cynical rejection of “far out” alternatives. Acceptance of “what is” instead of fighting it will over time make us part of the problem and not part of the solution. That is the danger. 
The Central Committee Resolution adopted by the League in opposition to the Landy amendments introduces a strong element of fatalism and defeatism into League politics
There will be a rise in the class struggle, greatest in the countries most affected by the crisis. At the same time, the struggles will not be united. Although the struggle in the semi- and under-developed countries will be “joined” by workers in the more healthy, advanced countries, this will not be impressed on the consciousness of the overwhelming majority of the workers. The struggle will retain its fragmented unconscious level. (emphasis added). 
The Resolution further insists that “The class struggle will increase, although mostly on a trade union and democratic basis; the lull will come to an end but not yet break into a l933-l934-type mass upsurge.” Another example
“Thus, while we do not expect a massive outbreak of the class struggle in the U.S. or on a world scale, we do not expect the relative peace of the past period to continue to the same degree. Rather we see a rising curve of struggle largely limited to trade union and democratic struggles.” 
There is an underlying consistency between the view that the next interval of struggle will be on a democratic and trade union basis and the advocacy of a labor party. The Central Committee Resolution accurately reflects this link when it states
“...our call for a labor party is based on a general assessment that at least at this point the road leading the working class to a revolutionary party will go through if not an actual labor party then at least a mass movement fighting for such a party within the labor movement.” 
It further states that “We would struggle jointly with non-revolutionary workers, even with left-wing bureaucrats, to actually try to build a movement to have the labor movement form an independent political party.” Naturally the masses will have to go through the stage of a struggle for a labor party, a party of the trade unions, since this too reflects the projected “fact” that their struggles will attain no more than a democratic and trade unionist content. We can, of course, try to put our content into the struggle, but we have to accept the framework of the labor party since the content the masses will put in will be reformist — democratic and unionist. So goes the logic of the argument. 
The labor party slogan is featured in the Resolution and has become increasingly central in our work. The acceptance of the labor party instead of the revolutionary party as the major party slogan reflects the acceptance of the limits to the struggle indicated by the Resolution in general. Let us examine this fatalistic limitation more closely. 
The Resolution attributes the restriction of the future struggle to democratic and trade unionist demands to the general economic situation alone. The critical factor, however, is the power of the union bureaucracy and the relationship of forces within the proletariat. The leadership question is not only the chronic and central question of the epoch but it is acutely important in this conjuncture. The Landy amendments rejected in totoby the current majority stood on this alternative understanding of reality. The democratic and unionist outlook of the masses stems fundamentally from its cynical acceptance of the reformist leadership. 
Tailing the consciousness of the masses means in reality tailing the consciousness and actions of the bureaucracy. The “realistic” statement of “what is going to be” and the adaptation of our struggle to that “reality” (actually the limits foisted upon the class by our enemies), instead of posing the question of how we overcomethat “reality,” is a continuation of the objectivism and outsiders’ view which marred our past politics. 
From the very origins of the League we stated our understanding that “critical support” was a version of the united front tactic. We understood that it meant entering into a relationship with a movement we marched with while counterposing to its program and seeking to expose its leadership. We, as opposed to the Spartacists, had no sectarian aversion to wielding the weapon of critical support for Arnold Miller and the Miners For Democracy; we gave no carte blanche to the left bureaucracy. We outlined the shape of the Miller-Rauh leftist current as we saw its development. We thought it was very possible, given the cynical attachment of the working class to the bureaucrats or aspiring bureaucrats as the “realistic” alternatives that the left bureaucrats would dominate the future upsurge. We thought it quite probable that we would have very small influence as compared to them. We would fight to change this probable development through critical support, among other tactics. However, we would give no blanket critical support; we made it clear that we would not accept their supremacy without a fight. We would not conform to any stage, period, or conjuncture of left bureaucratic hegemony in advance. We stood for the revolutionary alternative. We would not tail. In words now sneered at in the RSL, we “planted the pole,” we “unfurled the banner.” 
The current majority leadership of the RSL accepts the politics of the Left bureaucrats — democratic and trade unionist demands — as hegemonic for the next stage. If this course is kept to it can lead only to capitulation. The form of such a capitulation is not yet determined. It might lead to paving the way for the accession to power of the left bureaucrats. Our work, propaganda and agitation could help pave a boulevard to power for them should the masses begin to push underneath them. However, there is no guarantee in this epoch that reformists feel free enough to carry out their own program or part of it. The alternative course to capitulation is for the RSL to pave a road for itself as a substitute for the reformists. 
The central duty of revolutionists at the moment is to fight both variants of capitulation in the League. A key struggle in this regard is the fight against the omnipresent labor party slogan. 
Consciousness and Reality 
When the comrades who authored the Resolution discuss the conjuncture they cite objective conditions. However it is the subjective consciousness of the workers, the stated “democratic and trade union” consciousness, which typifies a limited and discrete stage that cannot be bypassed or above all fused with the stage afterward. According to the Resolution, objective conditions set the stage for the subjective consciousness that the League must relate to in order to end being “outsiders” from the labor movement. The acceptance of a discrete democratic and trade unionist stage is fatalist and defeatist. It posits a reformist stage, if we are to call things by their right name. Trotsky made the necessary point about Stalin’s version of stagism
...Comrade Stalin advanced his theory of stages that cannot be skipped over. By the word “stage” in this case, must not be understood the political level of the masses which varies with different strata, but of the conservative leaders who reflect the pressure of the bourgeoisie on the proletariat and conduct an irreconcilable struggle against the advanced sections of the proletariat. (Leon Trotsky on Britain, p. 267) 
Trotsky points out that the level of political consciousness is not the factor which marks off stages of development. Levels of consciousness (”democratic and trade-unionist” for one) vary between layers of the class. To accept the level of consciousness of the relatively backward as the level of the stage is to tail the misleaderships who reflect bourgeois understanding. To accept this understanding of the conjuncture is to misunderstand the conjuncture. The backward do not understand the objective conditions or tasks because the bureaucracy “understands” neither the objective conditions nor the tasks imposed on the proletariat. It is not simply a misunderstanding but a bourgeois, albeit reformist, understanding. 
When the comrades accept the limits of consciousness as being democratic and trade unionist for the entire conjuncture, they accept a limit to the possible tasks and results of the stage as well. Thus we have seen the fatalist statements already cited
“we see a rising curve of struggle largely limited to trade union and democratic struggles”; “the struggle will retain its fragmented unconscious level.” 
Comrades claim that this cynicism is a scientific assessment of “reality.” But this is not reality. It is simply the way that the bureaucracy of the labor movement conducts the struggle. It is designed to foster this level of consciousness and impose it upon the class. It is not “reality” but what the Marxists have in the past labeled as “realpolitik.” 
Why is it necessary to accept that the conjuncture will not end in a reversal of this defeatism? The defeat which propelled the present pro-bourgeois forces into leadership occurred long ago. As a result of this, the backward consciousness which comrades tail predominates at the moment and is used to block all potentially revolutionary upsets of the current balance of forces. But the working class, thisworking class, has not suffered massive defeats; to be precise, it has had some defeats but it is not defeated. If the working class had been smashed and its institutions crushed, then it would be both possible and necessary to say: from the vantage point of the revolutionary proletariat so much is possible and little more. But even then the tasks of revolutionaries would be to overcome the consequences of defeat, not just to accept them as limits to work within for the immediate stage. 
The backward workers see themselves as powerless and disunited. They are frightened of worse conditions to come, They feel themselves to be prisoners of forces beyond their control. They are cynical and see no alternatives to the present class leadership which looks like another uncontrollable “reality.” They are also cynical about the State, the electoral system, the President and the Congress. They see enemies on all sides, foreigners, blacks, other ethnic groups. Little better is possible, they feel. 
This outlook also permeates the more advanced layers, the ones who do have more belief in the possibility of social change through struggle. The more advanced layers are subjected to their own forms of cynicism in addition to those directly percolating up from the more backward workers. First, they are cynical about the capabilities of the mass of workers — whether they can go beyond democratic and trade union demands or fight for even these. Second, they are aware of the defeats the working class has suffered internationally — Chile, Bolivia, etc. Through this stratum the backward attitudes which in the last analysis are transmitted into the proletariat via the bureaucrats and their allies are being infused into the League. 
The mass of the working class believes itself to be weak and powerless. This is precisely backward consciousness, untrue and at variance with the objective conditions and the objectively necessary tasks of the proletariat. The gap between objective reality and subjective illusions is enormous. The trade union movement in the United States is more strongly organized and more powerful than any other in the world. The American working class is highly organized by a highly organized economy and integrated production methods. The historic volatility and combativity of the working class in the United States is still a cultural factor of no small proportion. The strategic concentration and lessons learned by a potent black proletariat are a vital asset. Even the familiarity with weaponry is far advanced as compared to many other national proletariats. 
In this specific conjuncture the economy is in serious trouble, an aspect of the chronic crisis besetting capitalism at this time and in this epoch. Cities and banks perch at the edge of default. The bourgeoisie is also going through its own serious crisis of leadership. The bourgeoisie itself is beginning to deepen its internal polarizations. The Presidency is still enormously weak; Congress has not gained authority; the “system” is still viewed cynically. The new mercenary army is untested, racially torn, suffering from disciplinary problems. The American bourgeoisie is not in imminent danger of falling apart. But its problems are severe and the lines of tension and division arc apparent. The crises of Vietnam and Watergate still haunt the ruling class. 
The fundamental material basis for reformism and for disunity in the working class is eroding as American capitalism moves to strip away the gains of the working class. The miseries imposed by the bourgeoisie are precisely what advanced consciousness would not accept and would fight. Yet the backward consciousness lingers on in the class even though its material base, sown in the past, erodes. 
Advanced workers are “advanced” in the Marxist sense to the degree that they understand the objective conditions, the needs and the consequent tasks of the proletariat. Marxism both stems from the objective conditions and at the same time reflects them; it is conscious of them and reacts upon them. Marxism represents the most advanced consciousness of the proletariat. Backward consciousness is consciousness which reflects a pro-bourgeois understanding of objective conditions and tasks. 
The backward workers are caught in the contradiction between their consciousness and their material condition as workers. They are caught between the subjective illusion of weakness and the objective reality of strength. Consequently the masses in struggle, and especially the oppressed sectors of the working class, may have one conception of the world (it is frequently torn with contradictions) but in practice find themselves doing something else. They find themselves acting in a more profoundly radical way. This is because of the impact of the real material interest of workers which can only be learned in struggle, in practice. 
Take the example of the ghetto riots of the 1960’s. At the same time that they were rising up in city after city, blacks also registered in record numbers in the Democratic Party. Burning cities and rebelling is not yet communist consciousness, but it is a dynamic step beyond the consciousness indicated by the black workers in the polling booths. The depth of the hostility demonstrated in practice reflected the dawning recognition that the material interests of the oppressed workers lie in the rejection, the destruction of capitalism — not in its democratic reform. 
The rioting black workers were demanding an alternative to the failures of the civil rights leadership, the black power and nationalist leadership, the trade union and liberal Democratic leaderships. It was at varying levels of consciousness — but the mass struggle was demanding a new leadership and program and at the same time trying to force one into existence. 
In France in 1968, the most massive general strike on record took place, during a conjuncture which seemed relatively slow-moving. The balance of forces was not favorable; the CP and SP led the working class and pursued a collaborationist strategy; revolution and even mass action appeared to be unlikely events. Nevertheless, the unprepared (and therefore seriously hampered) general strike rocked France and its solidly entrenched Gaullist regime and army. A month before, the French workers would have thought the prediction of a general strike to be wild. But in practice the workers built a truly massive attack on the seemingly stable regime. 
The failure of the CP and SP to lead — indeed, their role as betrayers — was proven. The centrist “Trotskyist” groups failed to provide an alternative strategy. Not one of the three major “Trotskyist” groups fought for a real political alternative to the Fifth Republic. They allowed the strike to remain substantially economic and defensive rather than seeking to press it in the necessary political and revolutionary direction. None of them opposed such a direction in the future — but they did not see it feasible at that stage. Basically their argument was not different from Gregory’s
“The workers’ consciousness is overall too retarded. The correct revolutionary leadership and understanding of conditions does not exist.” 
Material causes, the fundamental objective questions, are what compel the workers to move. The gap between the objective reality and consciousness is now enormous. The fundamental reality is not expressed by backward consciousness or democratic and trade unionist consciousness, but is expressed by the program of the Fourth International. Revolutionaries must demonstrate that the masses are capable of transcending their own consciousness of the moment. The power of the working class in the ghetto riots and especially the massive French events is proof of the need for our program. Revolutionaries use democratic and unionist demands, openly stating that they are subordinated to the revolutionary program. We emphasize that such demands cannot deal with the objective situation. The leaderships that foist such a limited program on the masses must be fought. 
Revolutionaries base themselves on the material conditions, including the objective power of the working class. They ceaselessly fight and expose the misleaderships whose role it is to blind the class from awareness of its historic tasks. The RSL in contrast now accepts the predominant belief among the advanced workers today that the class as a whole is weak. As we have stated, the backward workers’ belief that the working class is powerless has percolated into the advanced layer, and through this layer into the League. But the backward workers’ belief is only a reflection of the bureaucracy’s pro-bourgeois line — in a dialectical sense. The reformist bureaucrats, left and right, do not believe that the working class is weak. In a conservative and immediate sense the labor lieutenants of capital are actually afraid the workers might break out and smash everything in their path. A victory of the ranks would mean shunting the bureaucrats aside, in their view, in favor of chaos or the reds. It would mean, at the least, disruption of the system they urgently support. 
Therefore this bureaucracy has carefully avoided giving the ranks opportunities to break out. They know how deep the anger and frustration run. They recognize the power of the class. In the spring, Woodcock, the IUD and Gotbaum were flexing a few muscles; there were rallies of modest size in Washington and New York. This kind of rally has been dropped; the breakout by the ranks at the April 26 Washington rally was the signpost. Woodcock called off his projected little demonstration in Lansing soon after. The New York situation and similar situations elsewhere force some still-limited and sporadic actions on the bureaucrats, but as soon as possible they back away rapidly. Even though the leaders were forced to make general strike threats in New York, Gotbaum and others clearly recall the bridge tenders’ strike in 1970. They saw in embryo what a general strike could do and therefore now acted as conservatively as the situation allowed them to. 
The constant craven submissions that occur daily prove the bureaucracy’s fear of the ranks. Although the ranks are by no means consciously revolutionary, their actions would be incredibly powerful and radical — and the leadership knows it. The ranks in turn judge the actionsof the leaders, and this proves to them that the leaders are bad. But the ranks are rendered cynical and therefore accept the leadership; it exists, it is real, and there is no credible alternative. They believe the class is weak because the bureaucracy has, so far, prevented any display of strength. Thus the backward workers have drawn the conclusion that no display of strength is possible because there is no strength. The bureaucracy knows better. The workers will know better. 
The Labor Party Today 
The bureaucracy, even in its brief flirtation with rallies before it burned its fingers, was careful to emphasize electoral action and not industrial or mass action. The elections and the Democratic Party are a safety valve for the anger and frustration building up in wide sections of the class. The bureaucracy points to a Democratic victory as the answer. But they work up little enthusiasm from any significant layer of the class. The workers are cynical about more than the Democrats; their cynicism extends to the state, the President, Congress, etc. The war, the economy and Watergate have taken their toll in terms of the legitimacy of the institutions of society. The workers at the moment expect little from any politicians or from the “system.” 
The bureaucracy has been attempting not only to prop up the Democrats (and in some cases the Republicans) but to “restore faith in the democratic process,” ... faith in the electoral and bourgeois-democratic system. To not understand this is to understand nothing. That is the meaning of the bureaucracy’s political moves. They seek to prevent mass industrial action, to prop up the “democratic” state and to prop up the Democratic Party. Thus they try to prevent a workers’ victory over the system the bureaucracy is wedded to. 
The task of revolutionaries is to lead the working class to challenge state power. We must fight any attempt to rebuild support for the state. We must demonstrate the power of the workers’ alternative and combat the workers’ cynicism and self-cynicism. 
To this end, the labor party slogan was a central slogan in 1938 and is incorrect at this juncture. In 1938 the working class was the class that had created the CIO. It had engaged in giant battles on the industrial front against the bourgeoisie. The Lewis bureaucracy of the CIO had been pushed by the class into active economic combat. The reformist leadership betrayed the class, but it also in part reflected the militancy of the class and its struggle. It had to, in order to retain leadership. 
The militant economic strike was a familiar weapon to the workers. However, the class was tied politically to Roosevelt and the Democrats through the union bureaucracy. Labor party sentiment existed, and there was some hostility to Roosevelt. But the decisive elements of the bureaucracy and the class were still attached to the New Dealers. 
The working class became increasingly aware of the imitations of the strike weapon because of the historic impasse of the CIO restrained to the economic sphere. The central question was that the class move politically to challenge the state and break with all bourgeois forces. The labor party tactic was crucial: it put pressure on the bureaucracy (which enjoyed respect in the ranks) to break from Roosevelt and the Democrats (who also enjoyed respect). It posed the question of an independent party of the working class based upon the trade unions, a militant force created by the mass workers’ movement. 
In Trotsky’s hands the weapon was designed to emphasize the revolutionary content and the revolutionary party. The workers, even though the strike tactic was losing its influence because of recent defeats (Little Steel, etc.), well knew the power of their own actions which had built the CIO. When the labor party was posed, it meant the same militant CIO translated onto the political scene. The workers of the Late 1930’s would not understand surface electoralism to be the method of a struggle indicated by the labor party slogan. It meant the joining of a militant political weapon to a militant economic understanding. 
It was necessary, however, to combat the remaining beliefs that pro-bourgeois electoralism plusmilitant action had won the workers their gains (the belief in Roosevelt and the CIO struggles). That is one reason why Trotsky insisted on the revolutionary content in the slogan. He insisted, for example, on associating the workers’ militia slogan with the labor party slogan directly. 
The crisis, the sharpening of class relations, the creation of a workers’ party, a labor party, signifies immediately, immediately, a terrible sharpening of forces. The reaction will be immediately a fascist movement. That is why we must now connect the idea of the labor party with the consequences — otherwise we will appear only as pacifists with democratic illusions. (Trotsky on the Labor Party, p. 10) 
Today the situation is quite different. In the conjuncture the unions have not exhausted the strike weapon; it hasn’t been used. The workers are not educated by their life experience and struggle to know their own mass power through participating in their own economic actions. In contrast to the militants of the thirties, they see themselves as weak and impotent. On the other hand, they have far less confidence in the electoral system, the state and the Democrats. For them, the labor party slogan would not connote placing their militant fighting trade unions into politics — because the unions are not militant and fighting. This is why the labor party slogan can have only an electoralist content today. That is why training workers’ eyes on the electoral system does what the bureaucracy wants to do avoid a head-on confrontation. 
Throughout Lenin’s attack in “Left- Wing” Communism — An Infantile Disorder on the sectarians who reject using parliament and elections, he makes an additional point. The campaigns for and about parliament must emphasize the anti-parliamentary and anti-electoral politics leading to the dictatorship of the proletariat. In his critical support of the British Labour Party, Lenin stressed revolution, soviets and the proletarian dictatorship. He urged that these ideas be posed continually and in a popular manner. 
Comrade Gregory’s document and the Resolution give no such content to the labor party slogan. Where is the notion that the labor party cannot carry out our program, the program formally attached to the call for the party, by electoral means? Not only does the slogan conform to the bureaucracy’s electoralist path, the League also does not use the slogan in such a way as to guard against the danger. We give no warnings. Our literature never counters electoral illusions which must accompany the term “labor party.” And that is because the majority is presenting the labor party slogan not in the algebraic way that can be used to communicate in practice the need for the revolutionary party, but as part of a discrete stage: a reformist stage for this conjuncture because the challenge to state power is not possible at present. When algebra becomes arithmetic, this is the only result. 
Gregory took Landy to task for posing revolution in his “General Strike for a Workers’ Government” slogan. For Gregory, that meant revolution now, an impossibility in this conjuncture. (We have already proved that the slogan contains no call for insurrection now even though we insist that it does pose the connection between the strike and the need to take power.) To the political general strike, Gregory counterposes the labor party. For Trotsky, the call for a labor party was associated with a congress of labor to launch it and a workers’ government as its goal. This set of slogans poses algebraically the soviets, the revolutionary party, and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Revolutionary Marxists must fight for this meaning. If Comrade Gregory were to do that, he would be issuing a call for confrontation which, like the political general strike, would mean disaster for the class — in his opinion. 
Gregory does not fight for the revolutionary meaning of his labor party slogan. He is consistent; his methods of reducing algebraic demands to minimal demands mean that he divorces revolutionary implications from them. His labor party slogan is not used as a way of proving in struggle the need for a revolutionary party. Instead, his slogan addresses the advanced workers who want a revolutionary party and tells them to accept the consciousness of militants who feel that the stage is set only for a party with reformist content. “Revolutionary program” becomes a cover for a reformist call. The next stage will be the revolutionary stage, the socialist stage. We have heard that one before. 
For us the revolutionary party must be the central slogan. This slogan always is central on the strategic level. Now it is central on both the strategic and the immediate tactical level. We are a propaganda organization which uses every opportunity to agitate in order to propagandize more effectively. Action and active intervention are necessary for the correct use of propaganda and agitation. The labor party is an agitational slogan. A group may also systematically discuss in its propaganda how, when, and where to raise the labor party agitationally. 
This is not the question before the League. The RSL at the moment is using the slogan directly, and generally not in the form of systematic discussions of the method of using it. The labor party has become a minimal demand separated by a stage from the revolutionary party. 
The Revolutionary Party Caucus calls for the foremost slogans to be “Build the Revolutionary Party” and “Reconstruct the Fourth International.” We must continue our policy of giving critical support inside the unions when left bureaucratic currents actually wage struggles under the pressure of the ranks in motion. Since such elements have been noted for their acquiescence rather than struggle, the League has not been able to use this tactic frequently. The Revolutionary Party Caucus favors the use of the labor party slogan in similar fashion. When a segment of the bureaucracy or incipient bureaucracy moves to the left under pressure of the ranks, we can challenge them on the basis of the labor party as follows
“You claim to be for certain political demands necessary for the workers. You will never get them from the Democratic Party. You are betraying the interests of the ranks. We do not believe these demands can be really won and solidified without a further program, a revolutionary party, and a revolution. You don’t accept that. Then at least form your own party, a labor party, and fight for the demands; etc. You will not do so, you have no intention of really conducting this fight.” 
Thus the labor party slogan is not central in this conjuncture, but it can be used occasionally as a united front tactic, as part of an effort to win the ranks from the vacillating leaders whom the masses are pressing forward. When in fact the leaders are not vacillating but are firmly betraying, the central labor party slogan is a disaster. And that is the League’s present course. 
Trotsky on the Labor Party 
Trotsky’s discussions on the labor party have been subject to much abuse in the League, so they have to be carefully reexamined. The initial discussion was based on an interview with the New York Timesin 1932, in which Trotsky was quoted as saying that “the emergence of a labor party is inevitable” in the U.S. As he explained in the letter from Prinkipo of May 19, 1932, the term “labor party” had been ill-chosen; he had meant an independent party of the working class, an algebraic formulation which was perfectly open-ended, that could take on either a revolutionary or a reformist content as the struggle developed. He stated
The question was not of a labor party in the specific British sense of the word but in the general European sense, without designating what form such a party would take or what phases it would go through. (Leon Trotsky on the Labor Party, p. 6) 
Trotsky added that although a labor party of the British trade union type was possible, “that eventuality, which appears to me to be very problematical, does not constitute an aim for which the Communists must strive and on which one must concentrate the attention of the proletarian vanguard.” He explained the reason
A long period of confusion in the Comintern led many people to forget a very simple but absolutely irrevocable principle: that a Marxist, a proletarian revolutionist, cannot present himself before the working class with two banners. He cannot say at a workers’ meeting: “I have a ticket for a first-class party and another, cheaper ticket for the backward workers.” If I am a Communist, I must fight for the Communist Party. 
Although the situation changed by the time of the next discussion in 1938 the method for analyzing the question did not, and Trotsky did not retract his statement of principles, nor his methodology, nor indicate he had been wrong retrospectively in 1932. The class struggle itself, the creation of the CIO in the 1930’s determined that the form the “independent party of the working class” would have to take in the latter part of the decade. The mass struggles of the workers, reflected in a bureaucracy which to a degree led militant actions, determined that the algebra could no longer be “independent party of the working class.” Given the struggle of the unions, the party would have to be based upon them. 
The rise of the CIO was a result of an enormous mass working class movement. It was clear to Marxists that the movement must transcend itself and head towards politics. The transmutation of the CIO into politics had to be posed as a struggle for a CIO-initiated party, a trade union party. However, the labor party in this epoch has always been a party through which the labor bureaucracy maintained its ties to capitalism, attempting to maintain control over the workers by reflecting in part their need for an independent class party. The revolutionary party is the only party that truly represents the proletariat; we have no second banner. 
In 1938, if the pressure for an independent party of the class could be maximized, the bureaucracy might be forced to go along. (It might not
the reformists often do not carry out their own program out of fear of the masses’ actions.) The masses and the reformist leadership might fight for the same slogan but the meaning would be different to each. The program and ideological nature of the party which the Trotskyists called on the masses to struggle for was left open deliberately — not because they wanted a party whose program was neither bourgeois nor Marxist, but because the openness corresponded to the actual struggle. 
This was done in order to pose the Marxist solution as part of the CIO movement and not in counterposition to it. The labor party slogan, however, could not be perfectly algebraic (open-ended) in the way that “independent party of the working class” could. In answer to a question by Cannon about whether the labor party is a revolutionary party, Trotsky replied
I will not say that the labor party is a revolutionary party, but that we will do everything to make it possible. At every meeting I will say: I am a representative of the SWP. I consider it the only revolutionary party. But I am not a sectarian. You are trying now to create a big workers’ party. I will help you but I propose that you consider a program for this party. I make such and such propositions. I begin with this. Under these conditions it would be a big step forward. Why not say openly what is? Without any camouflage, without any diplomacy. (p. 20) 
For Trotsky, the question was always one of siding with the labor party struggle in order to raise the revolutionary party. As Trotsky stated in 1932
That the labor party can become an arena of successful struggle for us and that the labor party, created as a barrier to Communism, can under certain circumstances strengthen the Communist Party, is true, but only under the condition that we consider the labor party not as “our” party but as an arena in which we are acting as an absolutely independent Communist Party. (pp. 8-9) 
Trotsky did not claim nor could he claim that the labor party was a revolutionary party or even that it was perfectly open to that possibility. In stating that his party is the revolutionary party (then the SWP), he demonstrated that he still adhered to the 1932 position: there cannot be two banners for a revolutionary. In fact, he says explicitly that his 1932 position and outlook were essentially right
When for the first time the League considered this question, some seven or eight years ago — whether we should favor a labor party or not, whether we should develop initiative on this score — then the prevailing sentiment was not to do it, and that was absolutely correct. (p. 14) 
Thus the labor party remains a reformist party. In the course of struggle its content as a slogan becomes more open-ended. By participating in the struggle (even entering the labor party if necessary) the revolutionaries can raise the question of the revolutionary party in more concrete terms than otherwise. To raise the question of a “revolutionary labor party” sows illusions that the end result of the movement for an independent working class party should be an enormously expanded SWP (of 1938) under no matter what name. If the revolutionaries won hegemony in such a movement, then in a living way the labor party as such would cease to exist. The struggle would be openly and explicitly transformed into the creation of the revolutionary party. 
What made the conditions of 1938 different from 1932? Trotsky took great pains to show the SWP Leaders in the discussions that it was not the subjective mood of the workers or the bureaucrats that was decisive
rather it was the objective situation. By the objective situation he meant more than the mere fact that the CIO had been organized. The CIO struggle had reached an impasse and had to change its direction
The problem is not the mood of the masses but the objective situation, and our job is to confront the backward material of the masses with the tasks which are determined by objective facts and not by psychology. The same is absolutely correct for this specific question on the labor party. If the class struggle is not to be crushed, replaced by demoralization, then the movement must find a new channel and this channel is political. That is the fundamental argument in favor of this slogan. (p. 24) 
Trotsky considered the labor party an objective necessity at the time not solely because the CIO unions had come into existence, but more precisely because their struggle, hitherto taking the form of economic strikes, had reached the limits imposed by the renewal of the Great Depression. 
Now we have a movement of tremendous importance — the CIO; some 3,000,000 or more are organized in a new, more militant organization. This organization which began with strikes, big strikes, and also involved the AFL partially in these strikes for a raise in wages, this organization at the first step of its activity runs into the biggest crisis in the U.S. The perspective for economic strikes is, for the next period, excluded, given the situation of the growing unemployed ranks, etc. We can look for the possibility that it will put all its weight in the political balance. (p. 14, emphasis added.) 
The comrades of the majority read these passages to mean that the objective necessity was determined once and for all time by the rise of the CIO in the 1930’s. The specific impasse that the workers faced at the time of the 1938 discussions is not seen as specific. Thus Comrade Gregory wrote in his document, “From this point on, there could be no turning back. There would not be another movement to create industrial unions. Economic crisis would require political struggle, and in the absence of a mass revolutionary party this required demanding that the trade unions create the working class party to solve the immediate problems â¦” 
But the unions have “turned back” in one sense, a vital and important sense. The militant strikes characteristic of the early CIO are not characteristic today, and have not been dominant for nearly three decades. The CIO as a movementdoes not exist. For us to say now that “the perspective for economic strikes is, for the next period, excluded” would be unjustified
the unions, under the dead hand of this bureaucracy, have not even begun to fight. What we can say is that serious economic fights will pose the necessityfor political mass action even more sharply. The unions’ failure to fight has not enabled them to avoid defeats; on the contrary, the union-busting campaign in New York and other cities is proceeding rapidly over the limp bodies of the bureaucrats. The series of defeats could be reversed if the unions take a firm stand. In no central way has the U.S. working class suffered a smashing defeat. As we have already argued, a general strike would be far from a disaster for the unions, but an indication that they are no longer willing to take the bourgeoisie’s attacks lying down. The question of leadership, the existing balance of forces is the decisive political question in our epoch reflecting (and altering) the objective scene. 
Cde. Gregory tries to cement his argument with another passage from Trotsky’s discussions
Of course the question of the labor party cannot be considered independent from the general development of the next period. If a new prosperity comes for some time and postpones the question of a labor party, then the question will for some time become more or less academic, but we will continue to prepare the party in order not to lose time when the question again becomes acute... (Leon Trotsky on the Labor Party, p. 30) 
Thus for Trotsky, the labor party slogan does not remain a constant from 1938 through a period of prosperity. The objective conditions that Trotsky is considering are obviously not limited to the existence of the CIO but include the economic questions, tempo and direction of material drives, etc. To say that the slogan becomes “academic” is to say that it is not being used; it is returned to the shelf for use at the appropriate time. Of course, the party will educate the workers (including its own members) on the method and timing of the labor party slogan even when the slogan is not in use, but this is something quite different from continuous agitationaround the labor party slogan. Nevertheless, Cde. Gregory insists that a new prosperity (Trotsky’s hypothesis) would change nothing — precisely the contrary of what Trotsky wrote. 
To drive this point home, it need only be recalled that the League has always understood that Trotsky never expected a twenty-year resurrection of capitalism after the Second World War. When he hypothesized a prosperity he had only a short interval in mind. Yet even with this understanding Trotsky wrote that the labor party slogan would under certain circumstances be withdrawn. It follows from the logic of the position stated here that the slogan was central in the late 1930’s until the war, during the middle 1940’s (the post-World War II upsurge of the labor movement), and at no other time. 
This is also a question of the dynamics of the union bureaucracy. Trotsky used the labor party slogan to challenge the reformist bureaucracy and the workers who followed them. His working assumption was that these leaders were leading the workers in struggle. As he once wrote about the reformist bureaucrats (the context being the Anglo-Russian Committee and the British general strike of 1926)
The possibility of betrayal is always contained in reformism. But this does not mean that reformism and betrayal are one and the same thing at every moment. Not quite. Temporary agreements may be made with the reformists whenever they take a step forward. But to maintain a block with them when, frightened by the development of a movement, they commit treason, is equivalent to criminal toleration of traitors and a veiling of betrayal. (The Third International after Lenin, p. 129) 
The tactic of the united front still retains all its power as the most important method in the struggle for the masses. A basic principle of this tactic is 
“With the masses — always; with the vacillating leaders &#8212; sometimes, but only so long as they stand at the head of the masses.” It is necessary to make use of vacillating leaders while the masses are pushing them ahead, without for a moment abandoning criticism of these leaders. And it is necessary to break with them at the right time when they turn from vacillation to hostile action and betrayal. It is necessary to use the occasion of the break to expose the traitorous leaders and to contrast their position to that of the masses. It is precisely in this that the revolutionary essence of the united front policy consists. (Leon Trotsky on Britain, p. 255) 
The union bureaucracy today is not committing the same degree of treason as its British counterparts who destroyed the 1926 general strike. Yet it is betraying daily, and in no sense is it taking forward steps in the interests of the workers. The labor party is the demand of reformism, even though the reformists do not generally build a party independent of the bourgeoisie if they can help it. The call for a labor party is therefore either a proposed united front with the bureaucracy, a demand that Meany et al form a labor party (and thus its meaning as a rotten bloc used at the wrong time is clear); or else it is a united front proposal to the United National Caucus in the UAW and other opposition types who may even now stand for the labor party or will in the future. Arnold Miller toyed with the issue; other bureaucrats have done so and will continue to do so. As a result of pressure from the workers, even sections of the current bureaucracy will turn towards a labor party strategy. By agitating in such a direction at this point when the Millers are not leading the ranks in struggle, the League is laying the groundwork for these reformists and making the workers’ minds fertile for their victory instead of the revolutionaries’. 
Some of the majority leaders, Cde. Taber in particular, like to think that the labor party slogan is not a call for a united front with a section of the bureaucracy. We want a united front with the militant workers, says Taber; it is not their leaders who are responsible for their mistaken reformist ideas but the bourgeois ideology induced from society as a whole. 
This in reality is only another way to deny the centrality of the leadership question. The working class accepts its leadership and the reformist program not simply because of the leadership itself but precisely because bourgeois material incentives, values and ideas are “in the air.” The backward workers to whom Taber adapts do not believe they are following the bureaucracy, so Taber adopts this illusion too in the Resolution and other unguarded moments. For a revolutionist to be in a united front with militant workers means to be in a united front with some leadership (as well as the ranks) even if it lacks a name. A leadership moving with the workers can be pressured to fight for its party, goal, or program (even if it does not yet have it) — or stand exposed. In 1938, the bureaucracy didn’t have the labor party program, yet the stand by the Trotskyists was correct. Today the same stance leads us to substitute for the reformists who don’t raise even their own programs or their party, the labor party. 
Substituting for pro-bourgeois forces who don’t carry out their own demands out of fear is a time-honored form of capitulation. (e.g. the SWP’s substitution for the liberals in the anti-war movement based upon and confined to the bourgeois democratic demands which the bourgeois democrats could not fight for). The revolutionary who substitutes for the reformist becomes more and more reformist in practice. Trotsky said
The policy of the united front has not only its great advantages but its limits and its dangers as well. The united front, even in the form of temporary blocs, often impels one to opportunist deviations which are frequently fatal, as, for example, with Brandler in 1923. That danger becomes absolutely predominant in a situation in which the so-called Communist Party becomes a part of a labor party created by the grace of the propaganda and action of the Communist Party itself. (Leon Trotsky on the Labor Party, p. 8) 
Gregory sees nothing wrong with long-term united fronts. He writes
Try to apply this argument to the trade unions. What are the trade unions? As we all know, the current trade unions involve a long-term united front with the bureaucrats. Should we abandon them? Should we break the united front? Of course not, and it’s not really necessary to go into the absolute necessity of working in the trade unions, the defensive necessity of the trade unions, etc. They are objectively necessary. 
“Butthe labor party is also an objective necessity. Political struggle by the trade unions is necessary for defensive purposes. Therefore we make the united front appeal. 
At this point we will allow Trotsky to answer Gregory. 
To defend the maintenance of the Anglo-Russian Committee with the argument that we cannot leap over the organizations of the proletariat that are “historically given” is to engage in crude sophistry, which will invariably lead to opportunist conclusions. We cannot leap over the trade unions, since they are “historically given” organizations of the proletariat. But the Anglo-Russian Committee is a temporary formation, brought into existence by a temporary situation. (Leon Trotsky on Britain, p. 254) 
We have already cited Trotsky on the episodic, non-long-term nature of political united fronts with opposition leaderships, and the dangers that flow from the contrary policy. Lenin could be cited at length as well. Cde. Gregory can only argue that the labor party is nothing like the Anglo- Russian Committee; it isn’t temporary but on the contrary is the political equivalent of the economic trade unions. This attitude towards the Labour Party is shared by a multitude of politically dead “revolutionary” organizations in Britain who have chosen to enter and stay within the Labour Party as they do with unions. Gregory has established a basis for a similar policy when a labor party develops in the United States. The logic points to more than a united front: deep entry becomes the only conclusion. 
Gregory’s idea of the acceptability of the long term united front of the labor party was answered by Trotsky directly. In the course of discussing whether or not to raise the united front call for a labor party in 1932
To consider a labor party as an integrated series of united fronts signifies a misunderstanding of the notions both of the united front and of the party. The united front is determined by concrete circumstances, for concrete aims. The party is permanent. In a united front we leave our hands free to break with our temporary allies. In a common party with these allies we are bound by discipline and even by the fact of the party itself. The experience of the Kuomintang and of the Anglo-Russian Committee must be well understood. The strategic line dictated by the lack of a spirit of independence of the Communist Party and by the desire to enter into the “big” party (Kuomintang, Labour Party) produced inevitably all the consequences of the opportunistic adaptation to the will of the allies and, through them, to that of the enemy. We must educate our cadres to believe in the invincibility of the Communist idea and in the future of the Communist Party. The parallel struggle for another party inevitably produces in their minds a duality and turns them onto the road of opportunism. (Leon Trotsky on the Labor Party, p. 8) 
The danger of capitulation in the labor party slogan is indicated by the way the RSL has raised the slogan in recent months. It is not used to bring forward the revolutionary party, as Trotsky advocated. In the October Postal Action(New York), the “propaganda article” called for the labor party because “today there is no mass revolutionary party, and it won’t be formed overnight.” This amounts to separating the “today” labor party from the future “won’t be formed overnight” mass revolutionary party. Instead of using the labor party struggle as a way to build the revolutionary party, the two are divided. A labor party for now, a revolutionary party for the next stage. A reformist (or perhaps a “neither bourgeois nor proletarian”) party for now, a revolutionary party when it is possible. Not just a struggle for a labor party now instead of a struggle for the postponed revolutionary party, but the need now is for the actual labor party! 
The revolutionary party is used as a cover for the labor party designed to attract advanced workers and trap their practice at the level of the less advanced. A bridge can be traveled in two ways. This is the wrong direction. The algebra is broken down into minimal and maximal. Labor party for today, revolutionary party for tomorrow; reform “democratic and trade union” struggle stage today; revolutionary stage tomorrow. 
The basis for this is to be found in the stagist position of the Resolution, and it is explicit in Gregory. 
Do we say that there is nothing that can be done until a mass revolutionary party is built? Or do we raise the immediate need for the trade unions to struggle in the political arena, demanding the construction of a labor party to fight for the workers’ needs? The answer is obvious. 
The majority’s position can have no other meaning than the fight for a reformist interlude party. There is no party that is neither Marxist nor bourgeois, and Cde. Gregory’s labor party is specifically for the stage “until a mass revolutionary party is built”: that is, it is not a revolutionary party. Trotsky, answering Shachtman who couldn’t see what he was saying either, said: “It would be absurd to say that we advocate a reformist party.” But for Gregory, “the answer is obvious.” On the theoretical level, the League majority has laid the basis for a reformist stage and reformist parties. The danger of degeneration into outright centrism is the “obvious” course. 


Part 1 of this article: Class Struggle in the U.S. South Part 1: The “New South” and the Old Capitalism

Murray Finley is the head of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU), which has launched its campaign to unionize the Southern textile industry through a boycott of the giant J.P. Stevens Corporation. Finley states, “I believe trade unions are necessary to preserve the American way of life.” The triteness of his expression should not fool the reader into dismissing his sentiments as hollow rhetoric. His boycott campaign is proof that he really means it.

ACTWU is the result of the merger of two unions, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers and the Textile Workers Union, both of which were militant sections of the old CIO built by radical and combative memberships. In recent years, the union leaderships have pushed further to the right in response to the deepening crisis of world capitalism. The Amalgamated has been in the forefront of a rabidly jingoist fight for protectionist tariff barriers against textile and clothing imports. This fight is the bureaucrats’ alternative to a struggle for organizing the unorganized internationally, for higher and equal wages everywhere, for nationalizing and revitalizing the clothing industries. Such a struggle would have revolutionary implications, and needless to say, Finley and his friends do not find it practical.

What they do find practical is the only other alternative: to accept that capitalism in all its decadence is here to stay, to accept the bourgeois strategy of dividing the working class and to accept the bourgeois attempt to prop up a retrograde industry through inflated profits. However, one of the biggest threats to the wage scales of Amalgamated workers is the runaway shops in the South and their low wages. Tariff barriers are unsuitable in this case, and so ACTWU is forced into its boycott campaign.

We pointed out in Part 1 of this series that to organize a militant and righting union in the South would mean taking on the whole ruling class of the U.S., not just the local political representatives of capital but the national state. It would ensure an enormous explosion that would reverberate throughout the entire country. And that is no way to “preserve the American way of life” – capitalism and exploitation. We have already noted the historical oppression of white labor and the super-oppression of black labor in the South that the American way of life is based on. To understand the bureaucracy’s present strategy, we must sketch in the most recent developments in the Southern class struggle that endanger what the bourgeoisie and the labor bureaucrats wish to preserve.

Potential of Southern Labor
The emergence of the New South as a whole new setting for ravenous exploitation has proved very attractive to American capitalism. But the lure could be a Lorelei. For capitalism has weakened many of the powerful props that buttress not only the South but the entire American system. The Southern working class is bigger, more united and more strategically placed than ever before.

The South is now mainly urban. Financial and industrial power rules, and even agriculture is dominated by its more technologically advanced sectors. Industry still exists and is growing in the mill towns, company towns and small-town industrial areas – especially in the textile and apparel industries – but it is the urban bourgeoisie that leads its country cousins, and not the reverse as in the Southern tradition.

Similarly, the modern industrial cities contain the greatest social weight of the working class. The old parochial, rural and semi-rural community relationships are breaking down. Much of the recent flood of immigration to the urban work-force came from the countryside in one huge leap. This sharp “discontinuity” conceals a tremendous radical potential lying just beneath the surface, a surface which seems to reflect a conservative working class consciousness at the moment. A comparison with the period leading up to the Russian revolution is illustrative.

Lenin pointed out that the backbone of the Bolshevik Party that led the 1917 revolution consisted of workers who had emerged from the stifling grip of primitive rural Russia only a few years before. Trotsky, in his History of the Russian Revolution (Chapter 1), wrote:

“In Russia, the proletariat did not arise gradually through the ages, carrying with itself the burden of the past as in England, but in leaps involving sharp changes of environment, ties, relations, and a sharp break with the past. It is just this fact – combined with the concentrated oppression of Czarism – that made the Russian workers hospitable to the boldest conclusions of revolutionary thought – just as the backward industries were hospitable to the last word in capitalist organization.”

In the past, the pattern of Southern industry was quite different from that described by Trotsky. Much of Southern industry was small, isolated and far from modern. The well-known “rural consciousness” and “individualism” of Southern workers were retained under these conditions, and they hampered the growth of collective class consciousness and struggle against the bosses. This pattern was social and far from congenital with Southern workers. Those agrarians who went North to urban Michigan with its modern auto complexes, for example, became a driving force in the creation of the United Auto Workers and the organization of the sit-down strikes in the 1930’s. Even in the South, workers in the concentrated urban centers and in the social pressure cooker of the mines developed both militant struggles and advanced class identities.


Today, the barriers to advanced class consciousness are being undermined. Just as the low level and parochialism of Southern industry, together with the vast poverty and endless drudgery of the rural and industrial laborers helps to explain the persistence (not the creation) of racism as a divisive force, so do cooperative work patterns and urban sophistication tend to operate against racism. More exactly, these conditions allow the fundamental common class interests to triumph over the racist divisions within the class.

Part of the modern immigration from benighted rural production into the industrial centers is black, and the potential for radical rebellion among black workers undergoing the social leap is greatest of all. While blacks still have the worst jobs and lower pay than whites, they are differently situated than in the past. They are located in crucial industries and at the heart of production. Further, the recent history of black struggles has created a social awareness and a political understanding beyond that achieved by white Southern workers.

Given the history of the South, it may appear fantastic that blacks have already been the leaders of important Southern strikes. One example is the organization of the broiler chicken plants in Mississippi. When dominated in the fifties by white workers these plants were unorganized, but with the coming of blacks major union gains were made. The 1972 Mead Packing strike in Atlanta was waged for union recognition and an end to race discrimination. The Mead workers, largely black, won some gains under a leadership which thought of itself – and was thought to be – Communist. In 1972 black and white woodcutters united for a successful strike against paper mills in southern Mississippi. Many of the whites had been Klan members but ended up joining the NAACP, which supported the strike. The NAACP is a liberal and non-working class organization, but the fact that whites would join an organization they had previously hated indicates the radical shifts in consciousness that workers’ struggles can promote.

Such struggles, however, have been isolated, episodic, and limited in their political content; the opportunities for the Southern working class remain largely in the realm of the potential. The South is still open shop territory and is generally a region where the bosses’ writ runs unopposed by organized labor struggles. The reason is the role played by the labor bureaucracy, both regionally and nationally.

Bureaucracy’s Present Strategy
To see this, let us return to the struggle with J.P. Stevens. The formation of the ACTWU represented a defensive step against the deteriorating ability of the Textile Workers to achieve even minimal gains in the organization of their industry. At present, only ten percent of the textile workers in the South are unionized, although there has been no lack of opportunities for growth. The organization of the Oneita Knitting Mills in South Carolina several years ago was an inspiring example of black workers leading a straggle in unity with whites, and in an industry that until recently simply did not hire blacks. The organization of the Stevens plant at Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina about the same time (despite the fact that Stevens refused to negotiate a contract) was another significant victory. But for years the TWUA had preferred to take on the small plants and companies, generally avoiding the big companies in their centers of strength.

Now the new union, for defensive reasons at least, sees the need to take on the giants. The strategy proposed for the organization of Stevens, however, is one that is paving the way for a defeat. A boycott may at times be a useful tactic. But a boycott does not use the real strength of workers at the point of production. The boycott of Farah Manufacturing Company in Texas, which had been organized by the old Amalgamated, was combined with a 22 month-long strike that ended in success. But in the proposed battle with Stevens, a notorious violator of labor laws and court decisions, not even elementary forms of workers’ strength are being used. A South-wide strike by even the small percentage of workers in the AFL-CIO would bring the vicious Stevens outfit and its bourgeois allies to their knees.

The situation is worse when the particular nature of the boycott is considered. Only one-third of Stevens goods are sold directly to the public; the bulk is intermediate material sold to manufacturers and other industrialists. Legally, the union cannot pressure manufacturers to cease using Stevens goods nor can it even urge the public not to buy goods made from Stevens fabrics because of laws against secondary boycotts. While ACTWU may win informal agreements with some of the smaller manufacturers, this strategy remains a cheap substitute for invoking the power of the workers themselves. The fact that the union bureaucrats see this limited trade union struggle lasting as long as five years is an admission on their part of the half-heartedness of their approach. Recently the ACTWU has talked about buying stock in the J.P. Stevens Corporation (to wield “influence”) and has closed down its organizing office in the important Kannapolis, North Carolina area. This only accentuates its policy of avoiding the actual mobilization of the ranks for the struggle.


With textiles still the hub of Southern industry, the class struggle in the clothing mills will have a massive impact on other regional industries, particularly the traditional ones (hence the attention being paid to the Stevens boycott). The labor bureaucracy’s perspectives on organizing here reflects their weak-kneed leadership of Southern struggles in general.

The bureaucracy’s approach to the organization of industries moving to the South (including those unionized in other regions) provides the more rounded picture. The auto industry in recent years has looked Southward. General Motors in particular has set up six plants in the last three years in the Deep South. This “Southern strategy” has been a point of contention with the union during the auto contract rounds, as the UAW has accused GM of using anti-labor propaganda to keep the union out. Irving Bluestone, vice-president of the UAW, was quoted in the New York Times (November 17, 1976) as saying that many of the jobs created in the South were simply those that were being eliminated in the Northern plants, and that the result of these actions could damage the union’s ability to bargain nationwide.

The charges are of course true, but if the bosses’ line has been successful, the UAW has to share the blame. GM, through its native plant managers and foremen, has gained from appeals to Southern chauvinism. While this chauvinism must be actively fought, it is in part a reaction to the regional oppression that we have analyzed in Part 1. The labor bureaucracy’s support for the regional discrimination has allowed GM and other companies to manipulate the feelings of the more backward workers into anti-union sentiments.

GM’s agreement, in the 1976 contract negotiations, to remain “neutral” in the UAW’s Southern organizing attempts is a joke, but a greater mockery is the UAW’s dignifying it by acceptance. George Morris, GM vice-president and chief spokesman, denied that any Southern strategy existed and claimed that the $2 pay differential between the Clinton, Mississippi plants and UAW plants elsewhere was simply a courtesy to other Mississippi manufacturers. The same Times article quoted Morris as saying, “We don’t want to have a bad reputation with other employers in the area by setting wage rates way out of line with the others. We don’t want to be a skunk at the picnic.” And he certainly wants to keep the picnic going.

GM has also made appeals to anti-communism, through warnings against “bringing socialist unions in.” While the UAW will be able to argue (truthfully) that it in fact is not revolutionary, it is precisely the bureaucracy’s fostering of anti-militant attitudes which contributes to the bosses’ ability to fire a rabid anti-communist mood in the South, one that identifies even minimal struggles of Southern workers as being “communist-inspired.”

And then there are the simple but basic bread and butter appeals GM has made to the workers. The companies and city fathers contend that unionization will not provide any material gains for workers. While this is a deliberate lie, the fact is that where unions exist their leaderships have been selling out workers right and left. The UAW is no exception; its leadership’s history of betrayals paved the way for massive layoffs in auto, leaving thousands of auto workers with precious little to live on. Many workers have a real reason to wonder: is a union these days worth the price of a hard struggle against the Southern capitalists? The UAW did win a representation election at the GM Guide Lamp Division plant in Monroe, Louisiana this past December – a welcome and noteworthy event. But it is the only victory thus far in the recent organizing effort.

The UAW is under pressure from its ranks to solve the “Southern problem” and maintain their jobs. If UAW organizing efforts continue to fail in the South, the tops could well bring their protectionist “solutions” back home; during the auto crisis, Woodcock blamed the layoffs on foreign imports, in effect on foreign workers. Blaming Southern workers is one option the leadership can use to blindfold the membership if auto firms continue to pick up stakes and move South.

As a general rule, the American labor bureaucrats in the last years have shunned direct confrontations with the bosses whenever possible. They have been haunted by the danger that this massive, angry and supremely frustrated working class would sense its real power. The havoc such “anarchy” would cause would mean the destruction of capitalism as the goose that, if it no longer lays golden eggs, is still the source of the only eggs there are – or so the bureaucrats believe. As a substitute, they try to curry favor with the liberal bourgeoisie and to maneuver in the “political” arena. They concentrate on lobbying, wire-pulling, giving contributions, begging, smiling, blustering, sometimes threatening, and related forms of “political action.” Their “struggles” take place in the electoral arena, safely away from the masses – i.e., support to the Democratic Party in general and most recently the candidacy of Jimmy Carter.

The bureaucracy’s own Southern strategy is an application of this approach: avoiding big confrontations while depending on the Democrats and Carter to help them out. The passivity the bureaucracy exhibits towards battling Southern capitalism is not lost on the directors of Dixie industry: “Indeed, many Southern executives now say the only thing stopping the spread of unions is that organized labor itself has run out of both organizing zeal and useful purposes as an instrument of employee advancement.” (A.H. Raskin, New York Times, August 15, 1976.) While some of this can be chalked up to anti-union propaganda by the companies, the brazenness of the Southern bosses as they note the discrepancies between the potential of Southern labor and the actions of the labor misleadership points up the treachery of the union bureaucracy.

The no-win strategy of the union bosses is evident They would like to sell the Southern bourgeoisie on the idea of a nice safe union which will indeed “preserve the American way and be as unobtrusive as possible. They are caught m a profound contradiction. Neither the local nor the national bourgeoisie is going to buy unionization of the South. It is the wage differentials and the absence of unions which provide the inducement for their investment m the South. The bureaucrats, for their part, must defend their own vested interest as union leaders and protect the existence of their unions and at least their high-seniority members. The employers’ Southern strategy undermines their position and forces them to try to organize in the South. Caught in the contradiction they move cautiously, to say the least.

The Right Alternative
The same deepening economic crisis that forced the union leaders into the Southern organizing effort militates against the bourgeoisie’s willingness to tolerate unionization. The crisis with all its ups and downs, is relentlessly pushing the capitalists and the workers towards a head-on confrontation. The bureaucracy’s present strategy of simple timidity cannot last. The bureaucracy is relatively homogeneous in its perspectives today. Under the impact of sharpened class conflict, the right versus left split already present in embryo will accelerate. A central issue will have to be the Southern question. The more conservative sections of the bureaucracy will inevitably shy away from leading any genuinely militant struggles against the bosses of Southern industry, and they will increasingly turn their organizing efforts from timid boycotts into direct appeals to the bosses to allow their kind of unionization as a way to discipline a rebellious work force. (There exists the possibility that the right bureaucrats will avoid even this kind of unionism, but the historical tendency has been for them to pose such an alternative, as we will show.)


Recently the Stevens boycott campaign launched with great fanfare a group called Southerners for Economic Justice. According to the New York Times, the participants included “the mayor of Atlanta, a state senator and several veterans of the civil rights struggles of the 1960’s.” What is remarkable is not the class collaborationist intent of the ACTWU in looking for bourgeois support, nor the fact that such a committee could be put together in the South, but rather that the attempt netted such a pathetically small catch. Even the liberal sections of the Southern bourgeoisie are lukewarm to the already tepid efforts of the labor bureaucrats and refuse to break ranks with their class brothers. As the economic crisis deepens, some politicians may yet play games with the unions, but the serious sections of the Southern bourgeoisie want no part of them. When the struggle of the workers breaks loose, some politicians and capitalists may buy right-wing unionization as a way to halt a deeper radicalization. However, the social-historical base in the South for effective conservative unionism – an entrenched labor aristocracy – is weak. Far less risky would be the time-honored Southern solutions: direct anti-union violence, and the re-instigation of systematic racial violence. 

1946 Organizing Drive
Nevertheless, the boycott strategists of today (and the even more conservative strategists who will be employed tomorrow as the class struggle heightens) have a precedent to rely on in aiming their campaign at the bourgeoisie instead of the ranks of the workers. That is the old CIO’s million-dollar Southern Organizing Drive that was designed to crack open the union-busting South in 1946. It was ballyhooed as a crusade. Just as the reformists and Stalinists throughout the world marched with the workers far enough to maintain control, sections of the CIO around Walter Reuther ran a very militant line in order to capture the growing workers’ movement that crested at the end of the Second World War. One part of the CIO program was to protect the union ranks by an energetic organizing attempt in the South, then dominated by the Dixiecrats who represented small town business and agrarian plantation capital.

Unionization of the South, then as well as now, would have had revolutionary consequences for economic power in the United States. Unionization would have meant a head-on attack on the racism that cemented the Solid South and hence propped up bourgeois politics throughout the country. It would have knocked the cheap labor prop out from under the American class structure. It would have upset the delicate relationship between the growing urban centers of capital tied directly to Wall Street and the more primitive sections of the bourgeoisie. However, the Cold War and the witchhunt that eradicated not only the Stalinist but also the revolutionary elements in the union movement set up the conditions that enabled the CIO to retreat. Furthermore, the developing imperialist prosperity allowed gains for the workers which relieved the immediate pressure on the bureaucrats to organize the South.

In the meantime, however, the AFL had lined up openly with the reactionaries to oppose the CIO’s organizing drive. William Green, then the top boss of the AFL, proclaimed:

“Workers of the South ... are patriotic Americans. They cannot feel at home in any organization which seems incapable of cooperating with industry and spends most of its time in trying to destroy private industry. They have nothing in common with the foreign philosophies of the CIO.”
Green warned the bourgeoisie that it needed the AFL in the South to keep out the menace of the CIO. Referring to “communist forces” and calling the CIO “carpetbaggers with their repulsive program of trouble and turmoil,” the AFL sought to unionize the South by pleading its case to the corporations as a defense against the danger of a massive radical onslaught. George Meany stuck in his oar as well. The present head of the joint AFL-CIO was in the 1940’s Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL. His contribution was to brand the CIO as “an organization of communist fifth columnists.” Most significantly, the rapidly conservatizing CIO itself soon joined in the same anti-communist campaign. Organizing Director Van A. Bittner replied to the AFL: “Let me make one thing clear. There is no place in the Southern campaign for a single, solitary Communist! This organization of ours is an American organization fighting for America.”

Murray Finley’s dedication to the “American way” is vintage. The points in common between the crusade of the 1940’s and the campaign of the 1970’s also include inane attempts to stimulate Southern chauvinism, a weapon that can only boomerang. For example, the Stevens boycott literature publicizes an alleged quote from a union member: “Why should we allow a Massachusetts-founded and New York-based company to come down here and act as if they owned us as well as the mills?” The CIO in the forties said that it was “... backing Southern capital in its efforts to establish Southern owned and controlled industries.” The “there’s nobody here but us Southern fried chickens” approach fools nobody and reinforces the division between Southern and Northern workers. The headquarters of the Stevens boycott and of the ACTWU happen to be located in New York City, at Union Square (“Union” not in honor of trade unions but of the Union Army in the Civil War!).

The CIO’s Southern organizing drive petered out. Its betrayal set back any notion of a proletarian black and white struggle in the South, and left the door open for the petty-bourgeoisie to take the lead and set limits to the black struggle when it did erupt. The present organizing drive is also trying to sell itself as a protection for the bourgeoisie even more than for the workers. But there is a significant difference. In the 1940’s, there had been a recognizable and recent radicalism in the CIO, including real reds. The danger of a mass movement in the South was visible to the bourgeoisie. The sell-out job done by the AFL and then the CIO might have been a logical defensive step for the bourgeoisie to take, if it hadn’t proved redundant as the prosperity grew and the radicalism diminished. Today, because of the conservatism of the labor leadership and the apparent quiescence of the workers in both North and South, there is no reason why any serious element in the bourgeoisie would want to buy union protection. Their greatest fear is that even a “cautious” unionization drive could touch off the volcano that is building up beneath the surface of events.

However, the direction in which events are moving is also different than in the 1940’s. Radicalization is in the offing. Economic decline and not sustained prosperity is the projection for the future. The bureaucrats will do their best to avoid the consequences of class struggle, but unable to prevent it, they will seek to stem the tide. In short, Meany, Finley, Woodcock & Co. may soon have to sell their “preservation of the American way” ore aggressively in the bourgeois market, even if they wallow in a timid approach now. Meany’ promise of “all out support” to the passive boycott strategy means that he favors whatever moves are needed to defuse a situation fraught with dangers of “anarchy.” His experience as a red-baiter and ally of Southern businessmen in the forties will come in handy now.

The Left Alternative
It is a law of social development, in periods of deepening class struggle, that the bureaucracy which rests upon petty-bourgeois strata within the working class is subject to the pulls of the two fundamental, polar classes in society. In counterposition to the rightward push of one section, a left-wing section of the bureaucracy develops which reflects the upsurge of the workers in a vacillating way in order to lead it and deflect it. Like the right wing, the left wing will be acting in response to pressure from the ranks, from both Southern workers and workers in more advanced regions. By doing their best to prevent workers from reaching the revolutionary conclusions that will solve their basic problems, they too will strive to maintain “the American way.”

The most likely form this strategy will take will be to channel the militancy of the ranks so that the unions serve a “useful purpose as an instrument of employee advancement.” That is, their strategy is militant trade unionism. The ideal model for the program and strategy of the left bureaucracy goes something like this: Southern workers should be paid wages roughly equivalent to those of workers nationally. In order to achieve this, the Southern workers must go through the same struggles that other workers went through; that is, a new CIO-type movement of militant industrial unionism should be established in the South, where it never had been successful in obtaining a real foothold.

The left bureaucrats would thus be proposing a re-creation of the wage and class structures of the North. They would, in effect, be counterposing a struggle for limited democratic and trade union rights to the necessary struggle for the working class’ vital needs. The left bureaucracy, even more than the right, will press for heavier involvement of the bourgeois state in the trade unions in the future, in order to contain the ranks. They will not openly place the coming struggles in this framework, neither in the way they formulate demands nor in the way they attempt to lead militant struggles. And it is hardly preordained that they can effectively co-opt struggles in time to head off levels of greater militancy. Their exact course will be dependent on the precise tempo of the class struggle and the abilities of revolutionaries to intervene decisively. But the need to co-opt workers who will be forced by circumstances to seek radical solutions to gain even minimal reforms will force the left bureaucracy to put forward militant solutions within the confines of bourgeois society.

Centrists’ Perspectives
What makes it possible for us to predict this course is the fact that it has already been outlined in advance by those who will be among the left bureaucrats’ chief supporters, the centrist groups. The centrists are those leftists who attempt to conceal pro-capitalist policies under a revolutionary guise. Unlike reformists (like the present labor tops) centrists are “for” revolution, but like the reformists they objectively attempt to restrict the class struggle to within the bounds of capitalistlife. To them, revolutionary struggle “must occur, but not before a stage of democratic reform struggles, For Southern workers, the scheme runs like this: Stage 1 is the struggle for solidification of trade unions and the general winning of democratic rights by Southern workers. Stage 2 is promised to be the struggle for revolution. The centrists need not express this conception in an explicit form. Variants of this conception are put forth, corresponding to the particular politics of individual groupings. It is the basic pattern that we are concerned with.

In fact, left groups have not particularly concerned themselves up until now with specific perspectives for Southern labor. Consideration of the South has hardly been ignored, however, as any analysis of black liberation must at least take into account the history of blacks in the South which means largely a history of the South itself. And for groups like the Maoist October League and the Communist Labor Party, their views on black liberation have led them to distinguish the South from the rest of the U.S. in a totally incorrect way.

The October League considers that a “black nation” exists in the South residing in the “black belt” portions, this is a continuation of the analysis put forward on the black question by Stalin in the late twenties. The CLP takes this notion even further by claiming that the South is an internal colony of the US and advocates self-determination for both whites and blacks in the “Negro Nation” of the black belt – in effect calling for Southern secession from the union.


As we noted in Part I, the South has never been an internal colony of the U.S. except during the post-Civil War period of military occupation. As well, the oppression of blacks never took a national form in the U.S.; and the trend is further away from such a development, since blacks have become more absorbed into the working class, and the black migration from the South has meant that blacks form the majority in fewer and fewer actions of the region. It is instructive to note that there has never been a serious or popular nationalist movement that arose in the “black belt.”

Revolutionaries do not advocate “national” independence for blacks. We do say that blacks have the right to self-determination, but even here we differ with the OL on its meaning. For us, the policy is used to demonstrate to blacks that a workers’ state would protect and secure the rights and freedoms of blacks, including the right to secede – as part of the task of uniting blacks around a revolutionary working class solution to capitalist oppression. For the OL, self-determination is a minimal and utopian demand on the capitalist state.

The class struggle itself is responsible for the lack of attention given the “Southern question” by the left. Until recently, most left groups had little presence in the South, as the immediate level of struggle has been lower than elsewhere. As well, the mechanics of the Southern class struggle didn’t appear to have an immediate impact on the class struggle in other regions. Thus Southern labor struggles did not have the pressing importance on the left that they are now creating.

As the centrists turn towards the South, the more pronounced will be their stagist conception of the workers’ struggle. Other left groups provide evidence for this. The Revolutionary Communist Party, in the June 1976 issue of Revolution examined the union campaign at J.P. Stevens. It correctly attacked the ACTWU strategy for being weak and not relying on the workers’ power. And in noting the move of shops to the South, Revolution concluded that the working class must “fight to organize the unorganized in these regions in such a way as to develop the strength, consciousness and unity of the working class from coast to coast.” While one can argue little with the statement itself, the RCP offers no other way to do this than through purely trade union perspectives, and indicates that such a fight defined in this way must be a general strategy: “The fight to organize Stevens and spread unionization throughout the South is extremely important to the whole working class in fighting the capitalists’ attempts to use the conditions in this area to weaken unions everywhere and to pull down the wages of all workers.” (Emphasis added)


The Revolutionary Socialist League also covered the fight with Stevens in brief articles in the June 15 and July 15, 1976 issues of the Torch. While noting that “mass militant action” is necessary for Stevens workers, the Torch not only failed to criticize the union leadership’s boycott strategy but in fact hailed it as “an important first step in cracking the southern textile industry.”

The Torch no longer provides a broader political view of the class struggle in the South. The days prior to the expulsion of the LRP when we put forward such an overview (as in the Torch series of late 1974) are long gone. As Socialist Voice has previously observed, the RSL leadership has adapted to a typically centrist, stagist view of revolutionary development: today, the struggle for trade unionist and democratic demands; revolutionary politics will be appropriate only in the indefinite future. One form such an approach takes is playing the role of tailist and cheerleader for workers’ struggles, rather than offering a revolutionary direction. In the Stevens case, the RSL is actually celebrating a course of action by the bureaucrats which will be a major step towards defeat, along the lines of past organizing attempts by the tops.

In contrast, the RCP at least complains that the bureaucrats’ strategy is inadequate. But like all Maoists, the RCP adheres to a two-stage program of “revolution” not so different from the RSL’s, despite its formal insistence that one stage is sufficient for the special case of the superpower United States. Its call to “spread unionization throughout the South” is a variant of the model we ascribed to the left bureaucrats as well as an application of the Maoist minimal first-stage program. If examined beyond its surface value as a “good idea,” it turns out to pose a task of immense difficulty for Southern workers, one that is in fact a roadblock. Such a struggle could not successfully be carried out. Either the struggle for unionization must be accompanied by a more advanced stage of struggle on the way to a revolutionary seizure of power, or it will end in defeat.


This is another way of stating the application of permanent revolution to the South. The bourgeoisie is incapable of allowing Southern workers to get even what workers in other regions have gained. This is not due simply to objective economic capabilities but to the key political role of the South and the bourgeoisie’s fear that a movement, with its threatening implications for U.S. capitalism, will get out of hand and so must be crushed. Any attempt to duplicate the struggles and gains of workers in more advanced regions must tackle the very structure of Southern society, supported by Wall Street. Though this structure has changed somewhat as we have seen, it has remained firm in the principle of keeping workers down and in the systematic exploitation of blacks. The struggle, even if begun under the banner of trade union and democratic demands, necessarily requires a more profound struggle.

Another centrist group with a special version of stagism is the Spartacist League. In its reprinted founding document, Black and Red – Class Struggle Road to Negro Freedom, the SL calls for a “Southern organizing drive backed by organized labor,” and continues, “The demand for a Southern drive is complementary to the demand for a Freedom Labor Party, and, if achieved, would lay the material basis for such a party by creating an organized Southern base.” The Freedom Labor Party notion is previously described as a means “to go beyond needed reforms and pose a real challenge to the Southern system and the basic structure of society.” Moreover, “The creation of a South-wide Freedom Labor Party would serve as a tremendous impetus for similar action by Northern workers.”

The Spartacists have added a new ingredient to the recipe for Southern stagism: a labor party. This tactic is taken from the Marxist arsenal, true enough, but the Spartacists turn it into a reformist maneuver, not a revolutionary one. And because of the undeniable weakness of Southern unions, the SL is forced to insert a prior stage as a base for the projected labor party, a union organizing drive. Thus the SL has cooked itself up a four-stage theory for the South: first, a unionization drive to lay the basis for, second, a South-wide Freedom Labor Party; then a nationwide labor party, and last, presumably, a revolutionary party.

Their call for a labor party cannot be palmed off as one that “really” means a revolutionary party, because the idea of a special revolutionary party for the South is absurd. Unlike the Spartacists, Marxists never call for a reformist labor party as an intermediate step or a solution, since it is neither. The only real answer to the economic and social problems faced by the workers is revolution, and for that a revolutionary party is necessary. At certain times when the workers are moving towards independent class political action, revolutionaries can raise the slogan of a labor party. Rather than opposing the revolutionary party to the organization that workers are striving for whose nature is not yet determined, Marxists urge that it be a revolutionary party. The struggle for a labor party is in large part a struggle to decide the party’s goals.

Necessity for Politics
While the Spartacists do recognize that a political solution is necessary, like the other centrists they place a unionization stage ahead of the party. This is a dangerous inversion which can only lead the workers to disaster. The whole trend of modern decadent capitalism is towards the incorporation of unions into the state. The national government intervenes already in the most minute details of the unions m the rest of the country in order to hedge them in, and will certainly do so in the South unless the workers’ struggle reaches the political plane and challenges the bourgeois state. Even the union bureaucrats recognize that politics determines the conditions of unionism, for their chief legislative goal under President Carter is the Thompson bill that would cut through company stalling in representation elections, according to Business Week magazine (February 7, 1977). But this is just the bureaucrats’ defense of their own interests. A real unionization drive in the South requires revolutionary measures, from a policy of armed self-defense of the working class to ward off the bosses’ thugs and police, to a political campaign that will rouse the support of the entire working class and the masses of blacks in the South. Otherwise, the state’s use of violence and the bosses’ attempts to use racism as a weapon to divide the workers will triumph, bloodily, once more.


The only way to achieve even such a fundamental, minimal necessity for the Southern workers as trade unions is through politics. The centrists are in fact the only school of thought in the workers movement which believes that a stage of industrial organizing should precede any political stage. The labor bureaucrats, as we have shown, know that organizing unions is a question of who controls the power of the state; that is why they kneel at Carters footstool. Revolutionaries counter with the overthrow of the capitalist state and its replacement by a workers’ state as the only solution.

Lenin pointed out, in his struggle against “economism” (the early form of reformism in Russia), that the “economist” strategy of sticking to trade union and economic demands while avoiding political struggles in reality left politics to the liberal bourgeoisie. This meant, in effect, support to the liberals by accepting such a division of labor. The “economists” consciously intended only to postpone revolutionary arid independent working class political action, but they in fact capitulated to the liberals’ domination of the workers movement. This for Lenin spelled disaster, since he knew that the liberals would inevitably betray the working class.

Today the centrists follow the same “economist” line. The union stage which will lead to a “labor party,” a “freedom labor party” or even a “revolution” in the bye and bye accepts the bureaucracy’s political domination of the movement and its strategy of electoralism through the Democratic Party. The centrists may well reek with hostility to the Democrats at every breath as the Russian “economists” did in the beginning to the liberals, but their failure to fight for an alternative permits the present domination by the bureaucrats and therefore by their bourgeois political masters. The centrists’ hostility serves only to keep their formal skirts clean.

Few as they are, the centrists infect the crucial advanced layer of the working class that can in the future determine the political direction of the class as a whole. The centrists strategy paves the way for the future left bureaucrats to grab the leadership when the workers break out of their present straitjacket. And these elements, like their right-wing brothers, would rather see the workers smashed than permit a collision with the bourgeois state or with the Democrats (although if absolutely necessary, the lefts may be forced to move towards a reformist labor party on a bourgeois program in order to control the ranks).

Revolutionary politics is determined by the objective situation, what is materially necessary and materially possible for the working class. The reformist “economist” centrists instead tail the current levels of class consciousness, which is largely determined by the divisive, hesitant, chauvinist and “practical” struggle led by the bureaucrats and their Democratic Party allies. The result, just as in Russia, will only mean disastrous defeats for the workers unless revolutionaries can head them off.

The Revolutionary Alternative
All the factors which a potential South-wide unionization struggle bring into play point to our conclusion: the struggle must break out of the fetters in which it is now held. The national tie-ups of the Southern bourgeoisie, the penetration of the bourgeois state into the trade unions, the central position of blacks within the proletariat, the use of the South as a weapon against workers in other regions, even the present backwardness of Southern workers – all mandate a wider struggle.

We discussed how General Motors propaganda about the unions not providing for workers played a part in defeating organizing drive in Southern auto plants. The worker is partly convinced not only by the UAW’s sell-outs but by the labor bureaucracy in general. The unions in the South all too often negotiate sweetheart contracts at Oneita, for example, a wage increase of a few cents over three years was not tied to any cost-of-living provisions or job protection. Nearby, the miners are being sabotaged by the union leadership in trying to fight for better conditions. If many Southern workers are convinced today that “the union ain’t worth the fight,” they will be convinced tomorrow that the fight ain’t worth the confines of simple trade unionism. Formal logic dictates that the worker must take the “next step” of trade unionism and trade union consciousness. Marxism however, demonstrates how this “next step” must be transcended from the start as the workers pass through it in the process of reaching revolutionary consciousness and conclusions.


The reformists and centrists will attempt to prevent such conclusions from being reached and will actively fight the actions based on those conclusions. Though subject to the pressures of the ranks, the confirmed reformists can be pushed only so far. They will ultimately ally directly with the capitalists in an attempt to smash a revolutionary offensive by the workers. To pose a trade unionist stage for workers to go through as the centrists do, means establishing a basis for the left bureaucracy. Or else it means that the centrists substitute themselves for the left bureaucracy. Either way, it is the task of revolutionaries to defeat these pretenders to the revolutionary leadership of our class.

The starting point of a revolutionary approach to any question is to “say what is” to the working class. In regard to the South, workers must be told what we have stated here: that permanent revolution is the necessary political strategy in the South and that revolutionary leadership is necessary in the coming struggles if they are to be successful.

The centrists and reformists carry pro-bourgeois programs into the workers’ movement. To this, revolutionaries must counterpose the program on the Fourth International, the Transitional Program, as the appropriate program for an epoch in which the proletariat is the only class capable of solving fundamental democratic tasks. It is a program which connects the reform and democratic desires of the workers to the need for socialist revolution to fulfill these desires.

The transitional demands demonstrate how the proletariat in power, the workers’ state, would solve the problems facing the working class today. These include a sliding scale of wages and hours – this means to divide the available work up among the available workers with no cut in pay and providing for jobs for all. The workers must not be made to pay for the decay of capitalism; nationalization of the banks, corporations and large firms under workers’ control, to point to the alternative to bourgeois nationalization schemes and other bourgeois strategies to “solve” the crisis of capitalism; a workers government, since only the power of the proletariat organized in its own state provides the real starting point for solving the basic needs of the masses.

Other revolutionary demands include equal pay for equal work – abolish the Southern-wage differential; abolish racial discrimination. The struggle for democracy and democratic demands is a necessity for revolutionaries, who point put that they can be fully secured only through the socialist revolution and the workers’ state. Revolutionaries also understand that there are sharply different levels of oppression within the Southern working class, based upon geographical distinctions within the South, racial lines, craft lines, unemployment rates, and the like. Many of the most oppressed workers who are not immediately susceptible to union organization (like the unemployed) would be the steamrollers of a militant upsurge if they had the opportunity. The proletariat needs dual institutions like workers’ councils (soviets) for many reasons, including the ability of such formations to attract the most oppressed layers of the class. The rural poor can also be brought into the workers’ councils. Councils of the unemployed should be an immediate demand leading in this direction; union action towards such councils is necessary.


Revolutionaries must also intervene in the immediate burning questions that are dividing Southern workers from workers in other regions, including an active fight against regional chauvinism. For example, we do not think building a plant in the South is in itself “worse” than building a plant in other regions; we do not reinforce and capitulate to the anti-Southern chauvinism of workers outside the South that their relative privileges and labor leadership are responsible for. What we do oppose is that this comes at the expense of other workers. In particular cases, we may oppose the farming out of work to the South from where are layoffs. Generally we raise the demand that the trade unions organize the South, and ultimately link our positions to the struggle for jobs for all through the sliding scale of wages and hours.

To campaign for the above demands, programs and conceptions, critical as that is, is not enough. The present circumstances – the objective situation, balance of forces, consciousness of the masses – must be taken into account. Revolutionaries must fight for the revolutionary program in a form appropriate to present conditions and must consider the various important tactical questions that the present conjuncture in the Southern class struggle poses.

The obvious lack of organization that exists in the Southern working class must be taken into account. We do not abstain from or oppose what at this time would be limited but progressive and important gains for Southern workers – the organization of trade unions. We will give critical support to the present union organizing drives, while at the same time exposing the hesitations, vacillations, class collaboration and inevitable betrayals by the misleaders. For example, we support the merger of the TWUA-ACW as a defensive step against the capitalist attacks, but we counter the miserably weak approach to organizing textile workers as well as the fundamental loyalty to capitalism. We also demand that other unions carry out organizing drives in the South: the labor bureaucrats must be held responsible in their capacity as leaders. It is the limitation of the struggle to a CIO-type stage that we oppose.

Due to their particular oppression, revolutionary workers in the South will form a vital component of the proletarian vanguard of the U.S. A unity between black and white Southern workers will be forged, based primarily on the interest of the most oppressed. White workers will be won to fight racism, not by soft-pedaling the issue, but by a militant defense of blacks seen as necessary defense of all workers against the capitalist attacks. Because of their position in industry and their history of struggle, blacks have gained greater consciousness and combativity than whites, underneath the present calm. The black worker is not in the situation of having to wait for whites to defend his rights or for a white-led movement in the working class to arise. Blacks will play a major role in the fight against the inevitable attempts by the bourgeoisie to divide the workers and restore lynch law. The vanguard of the politically advanced and revolutionary workers will undoubtedly contain black workers out of proportion to their numbers.

The lurking danger for the workers is the one we have discussed at length coming from within the movement. “Common sense” argues that the Southern class struggle must pass through its democratic and trade unionist stage before reaching its revolutionary stage. “Common sense” was also on the side of the Mensheviks in Russia, who foresaw a democratic capitalist stage before the socialist revolution. Interestingly enough, the October Revolution was accomplished when only a tiny minority of workers were organized into trade unions.

The South of today is not Russia of 1917. But both belong to an epoch which assigns the completion of the democratic tasks to the revolutionary proletariat. To say that the class struggle must go through a democratic stage is to pave the way for betrayal. In the South the circumstances are even more graphic, for here the Menshevik strategy means that the workers will be betrayed before even achieving what workers in other regions of the U.S. have already won.

The class struggle in the South has the potential to be the geographical tinderbox of the American revolution, being the “weakest link of imperialism” within the most advanced metropolitan country. But if the misleaders of the workers are able to confine the struggle, the South may be used as one of the bosses’ most efficient cutting edges against the working class. It is the task of revolutionaries to ensure that history decides in favor of our class.




The Presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter has given the bourgeois mythologists the opportunity to popularize the notion of the “New South” as a region emerging into the mainstream of American life out of the shadows of backwardness and (now it can be told!) racial oppression. The notion has its material roots in the industrial rise of the so-called Sunbelt, the South and the Southwest, to the extent that the South is no longer a predominantly agricultural region. Awareness of this tendency, reinforced by Nixon’s highly touted “Southern strategy,” has led a number of Northeastern and Midwestern politicians to attempt to form a bloc to redistribute federal funds from the Sunbelt to the suffering North. Business Week magazine went so far as to predict a second “war” between the states.

These issues have been taken up on the left as well among New Left and socialist theorists. The seeming accommodation between blacks and whites in the South (most recently seen in the apparent appeal of a “conservative moderate” like Carter to a black community which was on the march only yesterday) has given rise to renewed interest in whether or not the South was or is an internal colony of the U.S., whether or not blacks constituted an oppressed nation in the South and a myriad of associated questions. A number of left writers conceive of a particularly malevolent faction of the U.S. ruling class in the Sunbelt which is primarily responsible for the evils of U.S. imperialism, and some say that there has been a “power shift” to this more or less independent bourgeoisie of the “Southern rim.”

In this series of articles we will analyze the South in relation to the rest of the United States and assess the transformation which has occurred as well as its limitations. It is necessary to describe the class relations between the Northern and Southern sections of the bourgeoisie as they have developed historically. Central to the analysis is the origins and the state of the black revolution. Most critical is the condition of the forgotten social force in the South, generally ignored in the bourgeois media, the working class.

This force is actually the key to what happens with the South. It is precisely the relative political quiescence of the working class, North and South, under the tutelage of the labor bureaucracy that has been the major factor in why the changes have occurred as they have. The period of working class silence on the political scene is rapidly coming to an end. And with this the possibility of real change in the South and the country as a whole arises. The underlying purpose of our articles is to show the necessary direction the struggle has to take and to arm the vanguard tactically and programmatically for the great days of change that impend.

A seemingly small but significant event is now occurring which is receiving modest attention from both the bourgeoisie and the left.


In the late spring of 1976 a new union emerged on the American labor scene, the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU). The union is the product of a merger between the Amalgamated Clothing Workers and the Textile Workers Union and claims 500,000 members. With the merger, union leaders announced a campaign to unionize Southern textiles by declaring a national boycott of the huge J.P. Stevens Corporation “on a scale greater than that ever undertaken by the American labor movement.”

We will deal later in more detail with the strategy of the merged union and its implications. One of the more acute bourgeois observers of the working class, A.H. Raskin of the New York Times, wrote that the battle with Stevens “has important implications for the future balance of strength between all American labor and management.” Raskin is right: to organize the big textile companies or any other major non-union industry in the South would mean taking on the entire American bourgeoisie in a political struggle which would have profound revolutionary consequences. The ACTWU’s most modest drive, projected to last many years and without a strike, has begun to reveal the top of a giant iceberg. The effort has been forced upon the bureaucracy by the submerged anger and militancy of Northern workers who fear for their wage standards in the face of competition from non-unionized corporations. The drive is being handled so gingerly for the reason Raskin cites. The revolutionary strategy we propose is necessary for deciding the outcome of the “balance of strength.”

The Civil War of the last century was a class war, a conflict between industrial capitalism and that creation of developing capitalism, slavery. The emancipation of blacks from slavery was a consequence' of this struggle but not its purpose. Questions of profit, capital accumulation and the political arrangements needed to secure them were the real issues, not fundamentally the rights of man. Since freeing the slaves was a necessity for the victory of Northern industrial capitalism, it was done. And since granting the demands of the freed blacks was an obstacle, it had to be stopped.

The slaves were emancipated in order to break the power of the slaveocracy. Yet the promised extension of the rights of bourgeois democracy to the freedmen was never carried through. For a time blacks did gain effective rights beyond freedom from slavery, such as the right to vote and citizenship. But the crucial bourgeois right for an agricultural population is the division of the land; without this all the other rights are undermined and the ability to survive is brought into question. The heralded “40 acres and a mule” was continually promised and continually denied. The newly freed blacks were cast into the economic limbo between slavery and a genuine farming class – sharecropping. Also, under the emergent system millions of poor whites were forced into a state of servitude that was only marginally superior.

In the middle of the 19th century Marx had already pointed to the fact that the bourgeoisie was an increasingly conservative force and that the democratic rights made possible by the bourgeois mode of production, and previously won by the struggles of the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie of the cities and countryside, would now have to be achieved by the proletariat through a revolution “in permanence.” The change became even more pronounced as capitalism descended from its progressive epoch through a transition period in the late 1800’s passing into its epoch of decadent monopolization and imperialism.

With its growth, capitalist power became decisively urban, although even in the advanced countries the bulk of the population remained agrarian. The potential alliance between the impoverished agriculturalists and workers struck fear into the bourgeoisie. In the cities the capitalists no longer faced the opposition only of radical artisans who still held a stake in private property. Rather, “the spectre of communism haunted Europe” (and the United States to a decree) as a propertyless proletariat grew in size, combativity and organization. Under this challenge the bourgeoisie had to defend all forms of property, including the remnants of defeated feudalism in Europe and the traditions of slavery in the U.S. The patterns of capitalist development led as well to the interpenetration of the various propertied interests under the dominant bourgeoisie. A blow against one form of property was a blow against all.


Once the slaveocracy was defeated the Northern bourgeoisie recognized the harmony of its interest with the Southern bourgeoisie and not the freed blacks. It not only reneged on “40 acres and a mule” but also abandoned completely the alliance with the blacks that had characterized the Reconstruction period after the Civil War. Although the Reconstruction governments in the Southern states were agencies of capital, they harkened back to the more radical and more dangerous period. Their base was the propertyless and restive black population. The Southern bourgeoisie which was occupied with making money both for the penetrating Northern capital and on its own account had in fact been freed far more than the blacks by the war. Its interests were hostile to the black-supported Reconstruction governments and lay with the “Redemption” wing of the Democratic Party. The price paid by Northern capital for the new alliance was the abandonment of all vestiges of black rights and the remains of Reconstruction, the removal of the noxious presence of Federal troops, and certain commercial commitments. The deal received its formal codification with the Compromise of 1877, in which the Redeemers threw the Presidential election to the Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and in return took over the few remaining Reconstruction governments.

Northern capital had reason to fear the volatility of the forces which led it to make the Compromise. Such forces were present and not only in the South: in the Midwest, farmers were moving into raging conflict with the railroads and big capital. The National Labor Union had been formed with a radical program in 1866. By the 1870’s major working class riots were erupting in cities around the country. Rebellion seemed to stalk the United States. The stabilization achieved by the political modus vivendi between the different sectors of capital did not prevent the class struggle from being waged but it did prevent its victory.

“Redemption” was akin to Thermidor in the French Revolution: counterrevolutionary in that it halted the evolution of gains into the hands of the plebeians and seated the conservative bourgeoisie in power, but it did not turn the clock back to slavery. The patricians who participated were thoroughly agencies of the now-dominant industrial and financial capitalism. The alliance between the Redeemers and Northern capital set a class relationship in motion which has lasted in differing forms for a hundred years. As a result of the 1877 Compromise, the Northern bourgeoisie matured to dominate the country as a whole with the aid of its junior partners, collaborators and compradors. In turn, this hegemony was ensured by the political power in Washington of the conservative Southern bastion of capitalism.

Modern imperialism began to develop slowly in the late 1800’s and began to make itself manifest in the United States, both in relation to the underdeveloped sections of the world and within the borders of the home country itself, although in a substantially altered form. The North exported capital to the South and invested there primarily in labor-intensive and extractive primary goods industries. Southern capital, while growing in size, shared in these enterprises as a junior partner. The capitalists extracted super-profits by exploiting Southern labor at a higher rate than Northern and raked in their gains most of all as a result of the oppression of the black plebeians. After 1877, tobacco and textiles were virtually the only major industries owned by Southerners, and in the 1890's even textiles succumbed to the Northern infusion of capital. All the well-known names of Northern capitalism  (Morgan, Rockefeller, Gould, etc.) held a lesser-known share in Southern capital. The chain of financial investment reached from Wall Street through its Atlanta outposts into every village in the South. The poor sharecropper or tenant farmer, bargaining his family’s future for credit against crops at the general store, was linked by the chain all the way to lower Manhattan. The rural Southerners were more brutally exploited than any other social element in the United States, and Southern workers were hardly better off.

As a result in part of this super-exploitation of the South, Northern capital was able to industrialize rapidly and move steadily to fashion the most powerful capitalist state in the world. In the process it was able to grant some reforms to Northern workers to stave off the looming rebellion and thus the start was made towards creating a conservative labor aristocracy that led to the craft based American Federation of Labor. The strategy of dividing the working masses was natural to the capitalist system, spawned by its own laws of development. While there may or may not at times occur plots and conspiracies to divide the workers, the system's drive to protect itself and expand arises organically out of its compulsion to weaken and disorient the massive numbers of propertyless workers and poor farmers arrayed against it. Nowhere was this rule by division more prominent than in the South.

The freed slaves were denied their essential bourgeois-democratic rights and systematically prevented from selling their labor power on the market as free workers. It was the denial of bourgeois rights that made super-exploitation possible by forcing the freedmen to sell their labor power cheaply. The denial of land as well to the blacks – and to poor whites in the South – meant that the scramble for slivers of land and crumbs to eat subjected the blacks to merciless attacks by the poor whites, straining to get ahead by the one advantage they had. The smashing of slavery had given birth to new forms of the old bestialism. This was the origin of the Klan, the lynch mobs, the murder, rape and horror that capitalism wrought. It was the result of Redemption, of the betrayals of the blacks by their erstwhile allies who (like the liberals of today) promised them free access to the greater society and deserted them when the chips and the profits were down.

The bourgeoisie did not have its own way without a fight by any means. The resurgence of the agrarian movement led to the Populist rebellions of the late 1880’s and early 1890’s. More explosive and more explicitly revolutionary in the South than in the West, the Populists rebelled against the disastrous economic conditions and the control of Wall Street. They were defeated, but not before critical interracial experiences between black and white plebeians took place, the like of which had never before been seen in the South. It was the depression of the mid-nineties that the bourgeoisie used to rip this potential unity apart. The brutal competition between blacks and whites whipped up by the reaction turned the poor whites toward murderous conduct towards the blacks. Capitalism triumphed by paying the price of a little status and slightly lesser misery to the once radical and now venomously racist poor whites.

The bourgeoisie sought to seal off hermetically any possibility of unity between the poor of both races through the Jim Crow laws. Blacks were disenfranchised, terrorized, humiliated and isolated from white workers and farmers, forced to surrender many of even the tinier advances gained from the Civil War and their own struggles. The survival and continued struggle of the black masses under such conditions is a tribute to oppressed working people everywhere as well as to blacks in particular, and it signifies that the class struggle goes on even when capitalism seems to have conclusively won.

Subjugation of blacks through the poor white pawns meant that the latter became tools for their own subjugation as well. The bloody smashing of workers’ strikes became the norm in the South. The convict-lease system was the American Way of slave labor camps. Mill towns, mining towns, company towns dotted the landscape; the life of the worker was isolation and omnipresent control. The South as a whole was kept in backwardness and poverty. Capitalism was capable of ruthless extraction of surplus-value but not of building a modern or industrial South. Although earlier visions of a New South were rampant among the Atlanta compradors around the turn of the century, they were a myth. The region seemed doomed to meager cash crop monoculture of cotton and a near-starvation agriculture. With one-third of the American population by 1929, the South produced only one-ninth of the nation’s manufactured products and contained only one-tenth of the American working class.

The barbarous division and weakening of the Southern masses through the attack on the blacks gave the South a political stability and increasingly reactionary character from Redemption on. The smashing of Reconstruction, Populism and strike movements furnished the basis for the long term hidebound stabilization of the South. The Southern base of Northern capital, with its one-party system and petty political tyrannies held the fort both in the South and in Washington for its senior partners. Based upon this political stability the combine was able to pursue a growing imperialism abroad. Just as slavery and the slave trade had been a crucial factor in the primitive capital accumulation that laid the basis for developing capitalism in the U.S. and especially in Europe, so too was late decadent capitalism bolstered by the exploitation of the super-oppressed in the American South. And in turn, the super-profits garnered from imperialism overseas allowed American capitalism to partially transform the South at a later point.

The reactionary nature of the South became the butt of liberal, democratic, pseudo-sophisticated criticism from the Northern centers of bourgeois power. As Trotsky pointed out, democracy in the imperialist epoch is the most aristocratic system of all because it requires so many “slaves” to provide its super-profits and its consequent tolerance. The snobbish noblesse oblige of a Rockefeller is somewhat offended by the crudities of a Pinochet, but Pinochet is merely Rockefeller’s overseer in the fields; Bilbo, Eastland and Thurmond were slave drivers in his own house. Thus in many respects the relationship of North to South was and is imperialist. But political analysis by means of formal and definitional equations is always dubious and in this case can lead to absurd and disastrous political conclusions. While the relationship has been substantially imperialist it has not been one that is a fundamentally colonial or national form of subjugation.

One can speculate that a successful Confederate secession might have led to the creation of a separate nation, much as Canada developed largely as a result of the Revolutionary War. This did not occur in the South, and moreover, the South was never a colony except for the period of conquest immediately following the Civil War. When the Populist rebellion occurred it was framed in terms of rights for Americans and not in terms of a separate nation or nationality. Interrelated history, geographical affinity, early and continued commercial ties and inter-bourgeois class links, close communication, common arteries of transportation and cultural ties all played their role in preventing the South from becoming economically subordinate in the same way as the colonial countries. The decisive difference, however, lay in the political role of the South. Whereas Nepal furnished Great Britain its Gurkha troops, the South provided the core of the U.S. military’s general staff in addition to cannon fodder. Whereas France’s “overseas departments” were represented in the National Assembly, the Southern politicians dominated the Congress and became the bastion of stability in Washington. The Northern and Southern bourgeoisies were allied and their deals were quid pro quos, even though one ally was the dominant partner.

Not the least cementing factor was the despoiling of the South and its people. The very backwardness of its economy left many resources untapped. But quick-buck depredations reinforced the historic problems of the exhausted land, played-out mines, etc. Capitalism in its inevitable short-sightedness thought nothing of sacrificing even future returns on capital for the sake of immediate rapine. This policy, of course, served to maintain the backward political structure which acted as ballast for the country as a whole. However, with the advent of the Great Depression of the thirties the ballast threatened to sink the entire ship. The already impoverished South was the hardest hit region, and the New Deal regime saw the need for reforms. Franklin Roosevelt stated in 1938:

“It is my conviction that the South presents right now the Nation’s No.1 economic problem – the Nation’s problem, not merely the South’s. For we have an economic unbalance in the Nation as a whole, due to this very condition of the South.” 
Certain changes were attempted, most notably the Tennessee Valley Authority and other schemes to prop up agriculture. Any serious attempt to modernize the South, would have meant division of the land and destruction of the cotton monoculture. This was impossible at the time because of the danger of an attack on property rights. In addition, the massive capital required for developing an industrial economy was not available. But the real problem was the upsurge of the working class.

Much of the AFL leadership and almost all of the leaders of the new and militant CIO were political allies of the liberal bourgeoisie clustered around Roosevelt. Both the John L. Lewis wing and the Communist Party within the CIO were often capable of industrial militancy under the pressure of the swelling rebellion of the workers. But they managed to hold the line against political independence for the labor movement which would have inevitably led toward a revolutionary confrontation with the bourgeois state. Their Popular Front tactics helped to consolidate the left-wing popular base for the New Deal. Roosevelt and the liberals could not have accepted this alliance, given the dangerous rebelliousness of the workers, without resting on the reactionary Southerners. And the Southern bourgeoisie, reactionary as it was, aligned itself to the New Deal and its sops because of the danger posed by the restive Southern masses. Any severe dislocation of race and class relations in the South, anything which allowed the unions in or gave the oppressed blacks an opportunity to move, would have hit the foundations of the ruling edifice. The capitulation to the Democratic Party of the reformist and Stalinist leaderships of the CIO upsurge maintained the coalition and enabled the Southern reactionaries to exercise their sway locally and nationally.

And yet the South now has been transformed. The New South seems to stand as a challenge to Marxists who believe that the revolution “in permanence” is the strategy for the working class in this epoch.  Has not capitalism “revolutionized” a backward region? Have not both the South and the blacks now gained the bourgeois-democratic rights so long denied? And was this done by the workers and poor farmers, as the Marxists expected, or by the bourgeoisie? In fact, it is only through the theory of permanent revolution that the significance of the Southern development can be understood. The extent to which the South expanded and the bourgeoisie tolerated democratic gains was the extent to which the proletariat was defeated internationally and checked, contained and politically decapitated nationally. The limit upon this development is measured by capitalism’s fundamental decay and the proletariat’s fundamental strength, no matter what its immediate defeats and no matter how its gains are twisted and used against it. The South was transformed only when the proletariat was checked by the betrayal of the labor bureaucracy, which bases its pro-capitalist world view on the short-term interests of the labor aristocracy. World War II delayed the upsurge of the working class in the U.S. and abroad, although wartime resource allocation permitted some development in the South. The real “take-off” occurred in the aftermath of the war with the worldwide restabilization of capital built upon the imperialist strength of the U.S. bourgeoisie and the defeat of the proletariat internationally.

From capital's point of view the record has indeed been impressive. The expansion of the Sunbelt region has far outpaced the rest of the U.S. in most important areas of capital development. For example, production of goods had already increased over five times from 1939 to 1955, and manufacturing employment has nearly doubled since then. Between 1967 and 1972 alone, capital spending in manufacturing rose 21 percent. There has been some industrial diversification as well. Construction became a critical industry, employing 7.3 percent of the work force compared to 5.2 percent nationally. In the past five years the region has become an important producer of capital goods. With industry its supporting services have also arrived: financing, advertising, printing, etc.


Industrialization implies urbanization, and the center of the South’s economy has switched to the urban centers. By the late sixties, for example, the agricultural work force in North Carolina was only one-sixth of the total, in Tennessee, only one-seventh. Farm employment declined from 3.8 million in 1950 to 1.5 million by 1972, while manufacturing jobs went up from 2.4 million to 4.4 million in the same period. In addition, the old one-crop lien system has been supplanted. The mechanization and diversification of agriculture, and the application of scientific techniques to it, is in sharp contrast to the almost primitive methods used formerly to work the land. The development of the South has necessarily led to an in-crease in regional wealth. Per capita incomes are approaching national norms and sometimes exceeding them. Charlotte, North Carolina, like some other Southern cities, has surpassed the per capita income of New York and other major cities in the Northeast and Midwest.

The changes in the economic structure have profoundly affected Southern society as a whole. Health, transportation and communications have rapidly advanced. There have also been “cultural” changes: if the various patterns of Southern music, diet, idiom, etc. could have been loosely classified as an American “sub-culture” years ago (apart of course from the black sub-culture to be discussed later in this series), the South has now been penetrated by a more general Americana. The current fad among non-Southern whites for chomping grits, digging country music, and the like – “redneck chic” – should convince no one that this culture is becoming more distant from the American mainstream. Greater awareness is not greater distance. In fact, the popularity of Southern styles demonstrates how the regions have drawn closer; what were once localized customs can now be gutted, commercialized and peddled on a larger scale, North and South, as any Nashville music entrepreneur well knows.

These changes and the changing class relations within which they occurred have had significant reflections in Southern politics. After World War II, political power in the South rested with the troglodytes who largely represented plantation agriculture, extractive industry and were based in the small town and rural petty bourgeoisie. The increasingly powerful urban capitalists chafed under the domination of the reactionaries but tolerated their rule while the lingering threat of the CIO “reds” and the working class in general remained. As part of the initial post-war upsurge of the working classes internationally, the CIO threatened a massive Southern organizing drive. The fledgling New South urban bourgeoisie quivered and kept the retrograde elements in power – they, after all, knew how to string up a union organizer.

The CIO threat disappeared for a number of reasons: the setbacks to the post-war strike wave in the U.S., the decapitation of the radical and revolutionary elements from the unions in the late forties and early fifties under the attack from McCarthyism and Truman’s “Fair Deal.” Basically the drive was abandoned because of the reformist labor leaders’ recognition that organizing the South would have meant a confrontation with the whole political structure of the nation: its political regime, its dominant class alliance, its racism. Underlying the capitulation was the fact that U.S. imperialism, which had emerged from the war as the hegemonic world power and now extracted surplus-value from every corner, was able to buy off a thick layer of labor aristocrats and buttress the increasingly conservative line of the labor bureaucracy.

When the organizing threat receded, a new relationship within the bourgeoisie was made possible. The new urban capitalists resting upon an urban middle class base began to displace the reactionaries. Modern industrial development needed decent education for at least a layer of workers and an atmosphere of respectability, culture and modernity for its executives and technicians. As well, the new alignment of forces demanded a more flexible approach to general social questions. The result was New South politics. In North Carolina and Georgia, for example, this meant the landmark reapportionment cases which redefined electoral districts to better represent the urban Piedmont centers. The rural rabble-rousing Talmadge machine in Georgia crumbled. Modern middle-class politicians like Dr. Frank Graham and Estes Kefauver arose. Urban middle and upper-class voters turned to Eisenhower, who ran as a Republican. The solid Democratic South began to crumble. It was a controlled political revolution.

The most dramatic shift of social policy has been toward the race question. The rising colonial revolution taking place internationally, especially in the context of the Cold War, was an important factor in bringing the race question once more to the fore in the United States. The shift of blacks from dying agricultural employment to the cities (South as well as North) meant that the black masses were getting industrial jobs, although at the lowest rungs. A critical number of Southern black college students had their appetites whetted by increased education. The small middle class black population also sought to rise. The hope of social mobility opened up by the new development of the South contrasted with the continued disenfranchisement and segregation. An explosion took place. During the fifties, the struggle of Southern blacks against their oppression began to emerge openly, reaching the higher expression of the civil rights movement in the early sixties. The Atlanta-based financial, mercantile and real estate interests favored a policy of moderation and token reforms toward this upsurge. Racial peace was a necessity for attracting new capital investment. Industrial giants also understood the advantage of preventing racial warfare in and around their factories, and merchants were wary of black boycotts of their goods.

The withdrawal of the Southern organizing drive (and what it would have meant in terms of a united anti-racist struggle) allowed the black struggle to take place under the leadership of the black middle class. Symbolically, it was the veteran black labor leader E. B. Nixon in Montgomery who pushed a little known “sky pilot,” the late Martin Luther King Jr., to lead the historic bus boycott in 1955. The absence of working class leadership signified that the black gains so bitterly fought for would not get out of hand and threaten the rising profit margins. The white Southern labor bureaucrats played little role except to tail the white bourgeoisie. National union leaders gave moral and monetary support – and of course maintained discrimination within the unions for as long as possible to benefit the labor aristocracy. Indeed, the Southern white urban bourgeoisie was able to parade as the “progressive” section of the white population; this strengthened the racism that the bureaucrats refused to fight within the white working class.

Despite the new “progressive” image toward blacks, the Southern establishment tries to remain a bastion of conservatism and political stability for the nation. The New South bourgeoisie with its national bourgeois partners remains devoted to the old super-repressive labor policies in the still relatively cheap-labor South. This is graphically illustrated by the “right-to-work” laws; ostensibly giving workers the “right” not to join a union, their main intent is to suppress the basic right to organize by reinforcing the open shops of the South. In contrast, the now covert racism remains, but not as the central tool for defending capitalist power in the South. The collaboration of the black leadership is a far easier and more pacific solution.

For all the importance of the economic and social changes in the South, the stability and moderation that the New South proclaims is an illusion, perhaps the most powerful condemnation of the decay of American imperialism within its own borders. Southern industry still shows the marks of its origin. Despite the new plants, the old labor-intensive industries are still proportionately a huge factor. By 1971 almost half of the South’s industrial employees were still in the five lowest paying industries: furniture, lumber, food, apparel and textiles. An important bourgeois journal admitted, “Undeniably, the South has attracted and encouraged primarily low-wage, labor-intensive industry in which even the fully employed worker often exists on the margin of poverty.” (South Today, May-June 1973)

Moreover, there are important qualifications to the South's capital expansion. Tourism and the military are major enterprises in the region (tourism alone accounting for 20 percent of the gross state product of Florida), and neither “industry” fosters the self-expansion of capitalist production either locally or nationally. Nor has the transformation of the South occurred independently of Northern capital and control. Northeastern capital is national capital; it is interpenetrated with every major nucleus of industrial and financial power in the country and abroad. By all accounts the “Southern” bourgeois is as likely as not to have been born elsewhere in the country (if not the world – South Carolina claims to have more West German investment than any country in the world except Germany).

The most important way in which historical continuity has been maintained is the super-exploitation of the Southern working class. Production workers in the South take home an average of $162 per week compared to the national average of $192. The South’s reputed cheaper living costs are essentially a myth and by no means offset such a wage gap. Moreover, inflation is higher in the South than elsewhere in the nation, and Southern workers generally get lower pensions and other fringe benefits than workers nationally. This stems in part from the existence of a large reservoir of potential workers in the growing urban ghettos and on the remaining tenant farms. An enormous factor is the unions’ weakness: only 15 percent of the South’s non-agricultural work force is organized, as compared to 28 percent nationally. The New York Times (July 2, 1973) stated:

“One of the main attractions of the South for Northern industrialists has been the South’s traditional attitude against unions. An industrialist moving South from St. Louis, Detroit, Cleveland or Chicago can easily find a place in the South where he will not be bothered with union work rules, union wage scales and continuing negotiations of contracts and grievances.”
As well, in the South, even unionization is no guarantee of wages equal to the national standard. The “Southern differential” is frequently preserved in contracts. And the super-exploitation of Southern labor generally is exceeded by the level of exploitation of blacks in the South. Although socially significant only a small number of black workers have done well. Most despite their entry into industry still get the worst-paying and roughest jobs, the highest unemployment rates, the worst living conditions, the least opportunity to move up – in general, rampant inequality remains the way of life in the homeland of slavery.


Thus the New South is developing not only along the lines of the old capitalism but with the traditions of the Old South. It buttresses U.S. capitalism as a whole not only by its political role in Washington but also by offering a cheap labor area to Northern capital which is used as a lever against Northern wages as well. The Old surviving in the New is a dialectical necessity for capitalism but it generates its own contradictions. For the South has produced a very large and dangerous modern working class concentrated not simply in isolated towns but in major cities. The old migration to the North of both blacks and whites is reversing. The proletariat is more national as the cultural gaps narrow. Most crucial, capitalism has been forced out of its own needs to weaken its own weapon of racial division. It will no longer be as simple as it once was to resurrect the full venom of this tool within the Southern working class. The Southern masses were always volatile but racism could turn this to fratricide. The new proletariat, therefore, will be extremely potent. While it has less of a history of organization, it is also burdened with less of a bureaucracy and labor aristocracy. The basic unionization steps that it will naturally take will require a political onslaught against the national bourgeoisie. Such a struggle once begun can only lead to a revolutionary confrontation. But this seems far distant from the consciousness of the Southern worker, perhaps as distant as the notion of the most massive general strike in history seemed to the French worker even a few days before the May events of 1968. Right now what seems real is the appeal of politicians like Jimmy Carter.

Carter is a classic New South politician. Based in Atlanta, he blends a policy of adjusting to necessary changes in Southern society with a basic loyalty to the old order. He was hardly a staunch advocate of the civil rights movement, but he did not support the white plebeian backlash. As Governor of Georgia, he established firm links with the more conservative black leaders (like Martin Luther King Sr.) in pursuing a policy of racial moderation. But of course he had mixed his tokenism with deft appeals to racism as when he ran for Governor in 1970. He tolerates the existing docile unions in the South but is hostile to labor organizing (as in his own peanut operation) and has always fought to maintain “right-to-work” laws.

With his head in Jehovah’s austere heaven and his heart seeking the approval of the jaded, sophisticated Northern Playboy, Carter epitomizes the contradictions of the New South bourgeoisie. This opportunist, sensitive to all pressures and counter pressures, appeals to blacks while seeking to safeguard “ethnic purity.” He dutifully cajoled labor leaders wherever he campaigned, but as one Southern capitalist, Robert E. Coleman, chairman of Riegel Textile Corporation, commented (New York Times, August 15, 1976):

“As a politician, his first concern is getting elected so I don't take too seriously all his campaign promises to labor. It is inconceivable to me on his whole record that he could be anything but what he says he is, a businessman who recognizes the need for a reasonable profit.”
Carter’s contradictions affected his campaign in the form of his oft-noted capacity for talking out of all sides of his mouth. This was inevitable for such a consummate New South candidate, representing  a basically contradictory class equilibrium which can hold together in its present fashion for only a historical moment. This contradictory moment in time can appear stable and long-lasting simply because the upcoming scene will be so radically different from the past. The most conservative factor in social history, consciousness frightened of the abyss, seeks to hold on to what is familiar. Southern domination of Washington politics, maintained for decades just below the topmost levels and now clambering into the White House in the person of Jimmy Carter, has grabbed for the pinnacle just at the point where its base is about to shatter. Capitalism in the pursuit of profit has once again reinforced its mortal enemy, the proletariat.


We have stated that the development of the New South was the product of the post-war defeat of the working classes which allowed imperialism to expand. We will show in future articles in this series how the development was largely sectoral, occurring at the expense of industry and growth elsewhere in the United States; and why the nature of these capital shifts is critical to the shape of the coming American revolution. The Southern take-off was certainly not the growth of a colonial or ex-colonial nation. In fact, it was financed by the rest of the world. This was a development based on imperialist-derived super-profits and far from an organic growth of capitalism. The upshot is that the South – and the North – can no longer allow the workers to keep even the relatively meager gains made in the past. The black advances arc already atrophying as black labor is thrown out of work first in the developing worldwide downturn that succeeded the post-war boom. Bourgeois democracy and equal rights were temporary concessions based upon the imperial capitalists' ability to secure super-profits. As this erodes, Carter, the “New South,” the labor bureaucracy and the whole constellation of bourgeois property will lie exposed before an undefeated working class on the march. Business Week (November 8, 1976) quoted an Arkansas businessman on the labor-black unity against “right-to work” legislation:

“What bothers me is that blacks here don’t seem to know what unions have done to them up North. If they stick with labor down here, then God only know where all this is going to stop.”
If God knows, Jimmy Carter will soon find out. And he will also find, like the Cheshire cat in Wonderland, that his ephemeral toothy grin has lost all the material reality behind it.

Cosby’s Campaign Against Black Workers

Proletarian Revolution No. 74 (Spring 2005)
 Transcribed, Edited and Formatted by Damon Maxwell and David Walters in 2008 for the Encyclopedia of Trotskyism On-Line.

Bill Cosby, the wealthy liberal Black comedian, has become the point man for a vicious attack on what he calls the Black “lower economic people.” It began at a NAACP gala in Washington D.C. on May 17, 2004, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Brown vs. Board of Education decision against segregation in public schools. Cosby's speech contemptuously denounced working-class Black parents and youth as responsible for social ills like unemployment that blight the Black community.
His tirade hit its low point when he gave a cover for racist police murders: 
These are people going around stealing Coca-Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over  a piece of pound cake and then we run out and we are outraged, “The cops shouldn’t have shot him.” What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand?
Unlike the justified mass outrage that he mocks, Cosby is outraged at the thought of protests over cops killing kids who supposedly commit petty thievery. Thus he makes light of hundreds of brutal slayings—like that of Amadou Diallo, who was shot 41 times in New York in 1999 for having his own  wallet in his hand. 
This scandalous harangue was only the beginning. In the same speech he spewed out a litany of racist and anti-working-class claims. He has since carried his campaign across the nation, and support for his campaign isn’t coming only from the far right. 
Cosby received accolades in the white and Black bourgeois media for his “courage,” for “telling it like it is.” The Democratic Party warmly welcomed his support. He has been feted by Black colleges and churches. He is supported not only by Black businessmen and reactionary nationalists like Louis Farrakhan, but also by liberal integrationists like Jesse Jackson and Kweisi Mfume, and artists like Spike Lee. Even the “militant” Al Sharpton registered as ambivalent. Outrage has been disgustingly little, even on the left.
COSBY’S DIATRIBE
Here are more gems from Cosby’s Washington speech:
The lower economic and lower middle economic people are not holding their end in this deal. ... And these people are not parenting. They’re buying things for the kid—$500 sneakers—for what? They won't buy or spend $250 on “Hooked on Phonics.” ... Brown v. Board of Education—these people who marched and were hit in the face with rocks and punched in the face to get an education and we got these knuckleheads walking around who don't want to learn English.
That is, poor Black people are wasting the opportunities that the civil rights struggle gave them, says Cosby. Parents in the “lower economic” order spoil and fail to control their “knucklehead” children who do not bother to learn standard English. 
It didn’t stop there. On July 1 in Chicago, at Jesse Jackson’s Operation Push conference, he enlarged on his attacks on poor Black workers. He deliberately stereotyped all impoverished Blacks as violent, uneducated and unmotivated: 
You’ve got to stop beating up your women because you can’t find a job, because you didn’t want to get an education and now you’re [earning] minimum wage. 
He said he didn’t care about airing “dirty laundry” in front of white people. About Black youth, he sneered, 
Let me tell you something, your dirty laundry gets out of school at 2:30 every day, it’s cursing and calling each other n-----. ... “They think they’re hip. They can’t read; they can’t write. They’re laughing and giggling, and they’re going nowhere. 
Cosby added that Blacks shouldn’t blame whites for their problems today: 
We have to turn the mirror around. Because for me it is almost analgesic to talk about what the white man is doing against us, and it keeps a person frozen in their seat. It keeps you frozen in your hole that you are sitting in to point up and say, âThat’s the reason why I am here.’ We need to stop this. 
Translation: Racism isn’t why poor Blacks are stuck at the bottom; it’s now their own fault. Conclusion: a struggle against racism is irrelevant.

COSBY’S ATTACK ON BLACK WORKERS
Cosby attributes anti-social conduct like unwillingness to work, criminality, drug and alcohol addiction and hostility to education to the poor in general. Much of this conduct is prevalent among the lumpen proletarians—the dregs of society, the hoodlums, rapists, drug pushers, pimps and other parasites—of all races. But it is a sick lie to paint the majority of less well-paid Black working-class people with the same brush.
Given racism and its forced inequality, Black people still constitute a disproportionate share of the people who are unemployed, many of whom have had their benefits slashed by Clinton’s “reform” measures and other cutbacks accelerated by Bush. No unprejudiced person can deny that this is the result of the history and ongoing reality of racism. The broad anti-working-class cutbacks in income and social benefits, combined with the anti-Black backlash, have taken their toll. 
Despite the pressures of joblessness, the overwhelming majority of able-bodied people on welfare or unemployment insurance wanted to work rather than to stay on the dole. The notion that the unemployed Black people are responsible for their own plight excuses these cutbacks while obstructing a desperately needed serious fight against layoffs and for jobs. There are more white people getting such assistance than Black people, yet the white racists and Cosby’s of this world characteristically single out the Black recipients and lump all poor Blacks together.
There is a connection, but it is not what Cosby assumes. Capitalism requires unemployment so it can use competition among workers to lower wages and conditions. In the U.S. and around the world, it uses racism to intensify this competition. Historically, after slavery American Black people served as an enforced reservoir of “free” but ill-paid labor, used to undercut all wage levels and to undermine strikes by all workers. U.S. capitalism grew rich by dividing and conquering the working class through racial oppression. Even though banned by law, the segregated racial caste system is still operative.
Today, past gains won by working-class struggles are being taken away. Wages are being forced down, and many workers are forced to compete even more for the minimum-wage, hardest and dirtiest jobs. In the U.S., the primary target continues to be the Black workers.
	 	
Racially-dictated unemployment, when it becomes long-term and chronic, serves as a spawning ground for lumpenproletarians. Their predatory conduct mirrors the rapaciousness of the capitalism that bred them. Racism segregates poverty-stricken Black workers, employed and unemployed, and forces them to live side by side with their predators, the lumpen elements. This miserable social situation is created by racist capitalism itself, not by personal choice.
COSBY’S ATTACK ON BLACK YOUTH
The anti-youth aspect of Cosby’s attack is virulent. He dwells on their lack of education and blames them and their parents. Never mind the decrepit and underfunded schools. Youth are characteristically rebellious, and given the huge barriers they face in the United States, Black youth are often particularly angry. Many plunge into escapist dreams of achieving celebrity, instead of the effort necessary to achieve the (highly improbable) long-term rewards that genteel society pretends are realistic. The rich—like Cosby—deliberately ignore the life and aspirations of youth in the ghettos. Very few Black people will be allowed to rise to the top and live the “American Dream.” 
On top of that, the schools are disciplining agencies, meting out more penalties and threats in an already threatening world. Much of what they teach is obedience and propaganda for the system. Many white kids play the game because they see reasonable job rewards for regurgitating the lessons. Not so for huge numbers of Black youth (and increasing numbers of whites as well), who are doomed to unemployment, marginal work or life in the army as cannon fodder. No wonder that more Black (and Latino) youth tend to be rebellious, suspicious and alienated from the start. 

THE ATTITUDE OF REVOLUTIONISTS
Proletarian revolutionists do not patronize working-class youth. When we see anti-social or criminal conduct by people who are racially or nationally oppressed, we readily acknowledge the fact and point out its dangers, just as we do with the rest of the working class. But we blame anti-social criminals for their rotten acts. We don’t smear the innocent by lumping them together with the guilty. We also point to the true cause—racist capitalism. Only a racist or a fool fails to note the deeper social causes. Cosby is no fool.
Cosby and his ilk are our enemies. They are part of the problem, not the solution. Today, the massive attack on the working class is picking up steam. Both Republicans and Democrats, representing the ruling class, are intent on wiping out all the gains made by workers during the explosive labor struggles of the 1930's and the Black revolt of the 1960’s-70’s. Cosby’s crusade meshes with the rollback by denying this reality and calling for individualist solutions, not a mass fightback. The once powerful militancy in defense of their rights demonstrated by Black workers has already been stifled for years, with the help of Black middle-class politicians and trade union misleaders. 
In the course of finding its way to revolutionary consciousness, the working class goes through many forms of rebellion, some productive and some self-defeating. As Marxists we know that consciousness of the truth does not come through supernatural revelations, intellectual saviors or elitist lectures and attacks. The trial and error of experience, together with the leadership of those workers who already understand revolutionary reality, is key. In fighting against the sometimes mistaken paths taken by workers, revolutionists always identify with the spirit of revolt. That spirit needs to be revived if the entwined struggle against racism and capitalism is to be resurgent. In contrast, Cosby is embarrassed by and seeks to crush the healthy aspects of the day-to-day struggle for survival in the ghetto—the rebellious spirit.
One of the most vicious weapons used historically, and still today, in the racist attack on Black people is “mind rape.” The pervasive myth of Black inferiority has not only been used to inflame white racists but has often been imposed on Black consciousness itself. In class society, many subjugated people often, for a time, accept the self-denigrating images forced upon them by their oppressors. The revolts against segregation and oppression in the 1960’s and 70’s not only attacked racist institutions and laws—they were the means through which many Black people cast off this self-defeating mythology. Thus “Black Pride” became a symbol of the anti-racist struggle. 
It is no accident that since the mass Black struggle has been diminished over the years, self-contempt has risen among the youth. And Cosby criminally tells them that they are right!
Moreover, social explosions and mass movements, from the Paris Commune to the Montgomery Bus Boycott, show that the best way for the oppressed and exploited to get rid of petty thievery and other anti-social conduct is through mass revolts against the social order. From this angle, Cosby's complaint denounces the only real solution to the problems he says he is concerned about.
WHY IS COSBY NOW SO POPULAR?
Current data shows that criminal conduct among Black youth has seriously receded in recent years. So why is Cosby’s attack now so openly popular in Black middle- and upper-class circles? 
As a result of the Black revolt of the 1960’s and 70’s, a sizable Black middle class has arisen. Because of their class position, many of them have come to share the disdain for the Black masses held by their white equivalents. But despite these common class attitudes, the Black upper strata have not been allowed to achieve Martin Luther King, Jr.’s dream of real equality. And even for them, “integration” is severely limited and tenuous. Over the years, many embarrassed middle-class Black people have tried to distance themselves from the Black poor, in order to achieve acceptance by their white counterparts.
The bitter phrase heard so often about the Black middle class is that “they have forgotten where they came from.” It isn’t entirely true, but not because many haven’t tried. The unyielding fact is that capitalist America remains thoroughly racist even though it now tries to hide it. The upper strata of Black people are still identified by whites as linked by color to the mass of poor Black people, and for all their displays of wealth and education, they have not been allowed to escape that fact. They are linked not with the real working people of the ghetto, with all their pluses and minuses, but with the all-pervasive racist stereotypes. 
The Black upper strata have tried a variety of approaches to fulfil their social ambitions. They enthused over Jesse Jackson’s political campaigns, which were designed to gain acceptance of Black people as “just another ethnic group” within the mainstream: “African-Americans”—just like Irish Americans, Italian Americans, etc. Their most saluted “role models” are people like Colin Powell, Condoleeza Rice and Barack Obama, who happen to be completely untinged by any contact with struggles against Black oppression. Many even momentarily embraced Farrakhan and his “Million Man March,” which called for Black “atonement” (no less!) for their alleged past misdeeds as a people. Since many feel that their role models have been totally incapable of changing the outlook of the youth, they temporarily bought into the false idea that Farrakhan could get them to clean up their act. 
With the appearance of Black faces in important positions, the middle class has had some hope for further success. Their open acceptance of Cosby’s attack shows an added degree of class confidence. But many also see the threat on the horizon. As the economic situation declines and joblessness expands, the prospects worsen and the potential for a greater growth of even more rebellious conduct by young Black workers looms on the horizon. As well, the gains made by much of the Black middle class are tied to government support, especially in areas like heavy industry and the public sector where contraction is most likely. Cutbacks and rollbacks loom like swords poised above their heads. An economic plunge could reduce their living standards to working-class levels, uncomfortably close to the image of the Black masses.
COSBY GETS HIS HISTORY BACKWARDS
Cosby’s key claim, that Black workers are betraying the gains made by the civil rights movement, is a monstrous untruth. He assumes that those gains were won by the middle-class religious and political leaders. In fact, the civil rights leadership hit an impasse in the late 1960's. Martin Luther King, the NAACP and the other leaders were fruitlessly begging the liberal Democrats to cede more gains. They warned that if they didn’t, the growing ghetto revolts would explode in size and power. None of them had the power to restrain the Black workers who led the uprisings. 
This revolt scared Washington into making massive concessions in jobs and income to Black America. The government and private bourgeois foundations moved rapidly to create a leadership which would have clout among the Black masses but would be dependent on the ruling-class institutions for its stake in society. Blacks were given positions in government and the corporations to back up the illusion that real upward mobility for the masses was possible. The expanded middle class owes its very existence to the struggle of the Black workers and unemployed who rose up in ghetto rebellions, and to the Black-led industrial strikes in the same years. 
Cosby says to the Black masses, “We won it for you.” In reality, they won it for him.
WHAT IS TO BE DONE
As the decay of capitalism deepens, the situation for Black America can only worsen. The history of liberation struggles reveals two facts. The huge gains were won by the working class through mass action. The primary beneficiaries have been the upper and middle strata, who misled the struggles. It is time that the Black working class took charge of its own destiny and provided the leadership for the struggles that will inevitably explode once again.
The ghetto revolts and the strikes of the 60’s and 70’s showed the enormous power of Black workers. Even with all the industrial erosion in the U.S., Black workers are still central to the workforce in the decisive industries and in major cities. The early 1970’s also showed—for the first time—that white workers would follow the lead of militant Black workers in significant strikes, even in the South. In the coming days when the class struggle erupts again, Black workers will take the lead again.
And they won’t be alone. Black workers have natural allies, not enemies, in the growing Latino and immigrant sectors of the working class. It is now inescapable that the only way that Black and Latino workers can keep their jobs, given racial and ethnic discrimination, is by championing a program of guaranteed jobs for all people who want to work.
Further struggles demanding the end of the attack on Black workers and youth will prove that racism is inherent in capitalism; the only way that democratic rights, equality and economic security can be achieved is through socialist revolution. Cosby’s tirade, and its support among the Black elite, shows once again that the fight against racism will have to be led by the Black working class and youth. An end to racism is only possible through the conquest of power by the united, interracial working class, and the building of socialism, led by its own re-created revolutionary party. Given their history of struggle, there is no doubt that young Black and Latino workers will be represented in the revolutionary vanguard far in excess of their proportion in society.
