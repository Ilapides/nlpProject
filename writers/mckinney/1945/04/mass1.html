<h3>Capitalist Press and the Miners</h3>

<p class="fst">Labor could learn a lot about how to carry on working class
propaganda by paying attention to the way the ruling class does the
job in its own capitalist, press. Not from the Hearst or McCormick
papers, which are merely the asinine, vicious and puerile babblings
of two old men and their paid street-walkers, but from a paper like
the <strong>New York Times</strong>. Here is an &ldquo;impartial&rdquo;
journal, &ldquo;independent&rdquo; and giving &ldquo;all the news
that&rsquo;s fit to print.&rdquo;</p>

<P>In a leading editorial on the UMWA and the coal negotiations
entitled &ldquo;Believe It or Not,&rdquo; the <strong>Times</strong> opens up
as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;If there is a strange spectacle anywhere in the
world to-day, it is the spectacle of the government of the United
States solemnly preparing to poll the coal miners, under its official
auspices, on the question whether they want to cripple the American
Army and the American Navy with a wartime strike.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">And further:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;... here is the government of the United States
moving with all its majesty and the logic of some character out of
Alice in Wonderland, to ask the coal miners whether they would or
would not like to wreck the whole war effort in the event that they
are dissatisfied with the action on their wage demands.&rdquo;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<a name="p2"></a>
<h4>The <em>Times</em>&rsquo; Secret</h4>

<p class="fst">Then the <strong>Times</strong> lets its readers in on a secret, evidently
known only to the <strong>Times</strong>. &ldquo;This fantastic situation is
all in strict accordance with the Smith-Connally Act, the so-called
&lsquo;anti-strike law.&rsquo;&rdquo; It seems the miners didn&rsquo;t
know about the Smith-Connally Act. They just filed that strike notice
because they wanted to give the employers an opportunity to change
their minds and the government an opportunity to enter as
&ldquo;conciliator.&rdquo;</p>

<P><em>What is important about this editorial is the fact that the
<strong>Times</strong> editors know how to prepare propaganda in
the interest of the capitalist class, which the <strong>Times</strong>
serves. Some workers and labor leaders will read this editorial
and exclaim that &ldquo;<strong>The Times</strong> is unfair to
labor,&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong>The Times</strong> has distorted the
dispute between the miners and the coal operators,&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong>The
Times</strong> is more reactionary than Smith and Connally.&rdquo;</em></p>

<P><em>All of which is pure nonsense and beside the point. As
spokesmen for capitalist &ldquo;free enterprise,&rdquo; the <strong>Times</strong>
editors know precisely what they are about. They are not primarily
concerned with the law or the. Smith-Connally Act They are primarily
concerned with strikes, with the stopping, of production, They know
that the chief function of a strike is to halt production.</em></p>

<P>A halt in production has two features, both of which are very
disagreeable to the capitalist employer and to the capitalist press,
the mouth-piece of the employer. <em>One thorn in the side of the
employers and stockholders is that a halt in production may have an
effect on profits, which may affect the big salaries and dividends.
Also the strike might be won by the union if it is strong enough and
militant enough to confront the employer (and the employer&rsquo;s
government) face to face for a showdown. In that case, the employer
will be forced to raise wages, which also affects profits, dividends
and the big salaries.</em></p>

<P>This is really what the <strong>Times</strong> is talking about. The <strong>Times</strong>
and the rest of the capitalist press did not adopt this attitude for
the period of the war. This is their permanent attitude in connection
with strikes and even in the matter of labor organization. This was
the attitude of the capitalists as far back as the first quarter of
the nineteenth century, when the workers were hauled into court and
convicted for &ldquo;conspiring to raise their wages.&rdquo; And all
they had done in this instance was attempt to form a union.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<a name="p3"></a>
<h4>Speaks for Capitalism</h4>

<p class="fst">The <strong>Times</strong> is particularly concerned now with strikes
because the ruling class, for which the <strong>Times</strong> speaks, is
engaged in the Second Imperialist World War. Out of military victory
in the war the capitalist ruling class in the United States expects
to attain world domination for United States capitalism, financial
and commercial.</p>

<P>It is or should be understandable to any worker why any banker,
manufacturer or capitalist journalist, seeing such a prize within
grasp, will writhe in agony and fury when confronted with the
possibility of a strike and the stopping of production. The fact that
a part of Poland and a half dozen little countries are tossed into
the Russian wolf pen, or that &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; Britain, will
come out of the war with all her millions of colonial slaves
accounted for, does not destroy the central fact that the capitalist
ruling class and its government at Washington fight the present war
for imperialist domination of the world.</p>

<P><em>It would never do of course to say this; that is, it would
never do to tell the masses of the people the truth. The capitalist
ruling class is class-conscious; it knows how to carry on the class
struggle, in peacetime and in wartime. With them the politics of war
is basically identical with the politics of peace. Even the use of
armed force, which is the chief characteristic of wartime politics,
is not peculiar to the wartime functioning of the ruling class. This
class never hesitates to use armed force in peace-time to defend its
class interests against the demands of the working-class.</em></p>

<P>The <strong>Times</strong> therefore, all the capitalist press and the
government, which Karl Marx called &ldquo;the executive committee of
the ruling class,&rdquo; construct their propaganda in such a way as
to further and protect their class interests. What other meaning can
be given to the demand for the no-strike pledge, the Little Steel
wage formula, job-freezing, the Smith-Connally Act and the new
Roosevelt-sponsored totalitarian slave labor bill?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<a name="p4"></a>
<h4>For Whom? Against Whom?</h4>

<p class="fst">Whose interests do these measures serve and protect? Which class?
Which class are they directed at and against? Which class makes
unlimited profits and disburses to itself unlimited cash dividends
while Davis, Vinson, Byrnes and Roosevelt &ldquo;hold the line&rdquo;?
Which class raises prices through the black market and other devices
of &ldquo;free enterprise&rdquo; while the OPA pats itself on the
back? Bill Green, Johnny Green, Phil Murray and R.J. Thomas should
answer these questions for the membership which pays their salaries.</p>

<P><em><strong>The Times</strong> says that the government is preparing to ask
the miners whether or not they want to cripple the Army and Navy. Or
whether or not not they would like to wreck the whole war effort.
Unfair? Biased? Perhaps, but that is beside the point. The point is
WHO is &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; and for what purpose? Who, which class is
ignoring the miners&rsquo; side and to what end? <strong>The Times</strong>
does a little tear-jerking too in this editorial. &ldquo;And so we
are treated to the spectacle of the same august government passing
out rations on Iwo Jima with one hand and strike votes with the
other.&rdquo;</em></p>

<P>This is good capitalist propaganda. It has been a complete success
up to now. That&rsquo;s what the <strong>Times</strong>, is published for.
That&rsquo;s how it makes its profits. It is a factory producing
capitalist propaganda. It pays dividends, too. Every daily paper in,
the U.S. does the same thing. (<strong>The Daily Worker</strong> is different
only in that it doesn&rsquo;t pay dividends, unless they carry
lend-lease to Russia on their books as dividends.)<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<a name="p5"></a>
<h4>Need a Labor Press</h4>

<p class="fst">Of course the capitalist press ignores the miners&rsquo; side. But
they don&rsquo;t ignore the coal operators&rsquo; side, the
automobile manufacturers&rsquo; side and the steel corporations&rsquo;
side. The capitalist press defends the class which supports it with
&ldquo;earnings&rdquo; filched through the unpaid toil of the working class.</p>

<P>The <strong>CIO News</strong>, the <strong>American Federationist</strong> of the AFL,
the papers of the railway brotherhoods, and the publications of the
CIO internationals should be giving the miners&rsquo; side and
defending their interests.</p>

<P><em>Labor must have its own daily papers to print its own side. The
capitalist press distorts and lies. We do not need to distort and we
will not lie. We can and must tell the truth. The imperialists must
lie. They must lie about the war, they must lie about their profits,
they must lie about the miners and all the other unions that stand up
and fight. Churchill and</em></p>

<P><em>Roosevelt must lie about Yalta, Stalin must lie about his slave
dungeons, his deportations, his anti-union depredations and his murders.</em></p>

<P>The whole propaganda of imperialism is a mass of distortions,
trickery and lies. The imperialist governments are staffed with
distorters and liars who go under the name of &ldquo;diplomats.&rdquo;
The capitalist press is staffed by liars and distorters who go under
the name of editors, reporters, correspondents.</p>

<P><em>One problem of the working class today is to have our own
working class press to tell the working class truth, to spread
working class propaganda, to fight for labor and not for Roosevelt.
There should be no whimpering over the &ldquo;distortions&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;unfairness&rdquo; of the capitalists, their press and
their government.</em></p>
