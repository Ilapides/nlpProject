<h3>Black Market Is Necessary for Profits</h3>

<p class="fst">It has been my contention for sometime that the use of the
expression &ldquo;black market,&rdquo; especially when applied to the
meat situation, was incorrect. What is called the &ldquo;black
market&rdquo; is nothing more nor less than the regular activity of
&ldquo;our system of free enterprise&rdquo; carried on for
profit-making under the &ldquo;restrictions'&rsquo; laid down by the
OPA. <em>The so-called black, market is a method used by the big
packers, poultry raisers, canners and produce jobbers to raise prices
despite the official price ceilings.</em></p>

<p>There are five big meat packers in the country. They control not
only the meat packing industry but also to a large extent the raising
of cattle. Altogether there are less than 100 packers of any
consequence. Then where do the little fellows get the meat which
sells at &ldquo;black market&rdquo; prices? From these packers of
course, all of whom are members of the American Meat Packers
Association. This is an organization like the Iron and Steel
Institute which controls the production and marketing of steel and
steel products.</p>

<p>The members of the Meat Packers Association may not increase their
profits directly right now from their connivance in &ldquo;black
market&rdquo; operations but they do hope by this procedure to defeat
the price control measures of their government to the end that they
may be granted &ldquo;legal&rdquo; price increases. They do this by
withholding meat from the market and by conspiring with the
go-between shysters to run meat through &ldquo;black market&rdquo; dealers.</p>

<p><em>And now comes one Arthur Winn, representative of the packers,
to admit that all of this is true. Winn admitted in testimony before
the Senate Banking committee that many packers are violating price
ceilings and are operating in the &ldquo;black market.&rdquo; The
packers don&rsquo;t like the OPA rulings and the price ceilings and
they refuse to abide by them. They refuse to submit financial
statements tothe OPA. One can understand this when it is revealed
that the profits of the meat people have jumped 700 per cent (That&rsquo;s
one for the capitalist press to write editorials about.)</em></p>

<p>The packers and others in the food industry are only following in
the footsteps of the airplane manufacturers and other &ldquo;free
enterprisers.&rdquo; If their government refuses to give them the
profits which they demand they will refuse to produce, and in the
case of the meat producers, what they do produce they sell through
the &ldquo;black market,&rdquo; And nobody stopped them: the
President, Byrnes, &ldquo;the White House spokesman,&rdquo; nor OPA
Bowles, nor Congress.</p>

<p><em>The capitalist manufacturers and bankers are not impressed by
the speeches of Murray and Thomas about the boys dying in Europe
because they don&rsquo;t get enough supplies from the home front.
They know that the purpose of the dying is to guarantee profits to
U.S. &ldquo;free enterprise.&rdquo; They are not fooled about this.
They know that the best patriot is not the youth who dies on the
battlefield but the man who remains at home and keeps the profits of
capitalist industry at an all-time high. If you want to be a real
patriot and go down in history as a man who served his country well
the thing to do is to become a meat packer during war time, boost
your profits 700 per cent, boost the cost of living 43 per cent while
wages go up only half that amount and the boys die on the front by
the hundreds of thousands.</em></p>

<p>Also the working people should not forget that the meat packers,
the automobile and steel makers, the shipowners, the coal operators
and all of &ldquo;free enterprise&rdquo; had a president who approved
their profit boosting schemes, so that they might get their profits
not only in wartime but after the war is over. A National Service Act
which was demanded chains the working class to the 700 per
cent-profit mines, mills and factories.</p>
