<br />
<p class="fst">Herbert R. Northrup&#8217;s first-hand study of the Negro in the labor
movement in the United States <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> should be a textbook for every
union official, for every white and black worker and particularly for
revolutionists who want to see the trade-union movement as it really
is in relation to the Negro worker. This holds especially for the AFL
and the non-affiliated railway unions. These unions are revealed in
all their stark nakedness and hypocrisy in connection with their
anti-Negro position. Mr. Northrup made personal investigations and
has told in this book the results of those investigations. He reports
what the AFL, railway and CIO unions stand for, what they do and how
they act when faced with the problem of the Negro in industry. He
tells what their constitutions say, what is provided for in their
rituals and to what extent the organized labor movement practices
what it preaches in relation to the Negro worker and the Negro
member.</p>
<p>The author has been well placed for acquiring the necessary
information and experience for this study. He has worked for the WLB,
was a consultant to the Fair Employment Practices Committee and is
now connected with the National Labor Relations Board. In his preface
he reports that &#8220;the basic material for this book was gathered in
the field during the summers of 1940&#8211;1943.&#8221;</p>
<p>The book is divided into sections dealing with the building
trades, railroads, tobacco industry, textiles, clothing and
laundries; longshoremen, coal mines, iron and steel, automobiles and
aircraft and shipbuilding. There are explanatory notes on the
material in the various chapters, a bibliography and an introduction
by Prof. Sumner Slichter of Harvard University, where Mr. Northrup
took his doctorate in economics and wrote his thesis on <em>Negro
Labor and Union Policies in the South</em>.</p>
<p>Mr. Northrup not only presents the reader with an abundance of
factual material on the subject with which he is dealing but he has a
point of view which he gives in summary form at the end of the book
in his <em>Concluding Remarks</em>.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Union Discrimination Against Negroes</h4>
<p class="fst">The author warns that care must be exercised in any attempt to
evaluate the &#8220;racial policies&#8221; of the unions for the reason that
&#8220;the attitude of unions toward Negroes ... often varies within the
same organization from region to region ...&#8221; He classifies the
unions which exclude Negroes by ritual, the machinists, for example;
unions which exclude Negroes by the constitution, and names six AFL
affiliates and seven non-affiliated railway unions. Then he gives the
unions which exclude Negroes by &#8220;tacit consent,&#8221; naming six AFL
affiliates and ten unaffiliated organizations. His last category is
unions &#8220;which afford Negroes only segregated auxiliary status.&#8221;
He finds seven of these in the AFL and two unaffiliated. It is
probably not necessary to say that no CIO international or local
union falls within any of these exclusionist categories.</p>
<p>In connection with Northrup&#8217;s catalog of unions which
discriminate against Negroes in one way or another, it is necessary
to bear in mind his own warning about &#8220;dynamic elements&#8221; which
operate to change the picture. For instance, Northrup gives the
Seafarers International Union as one of the unions excluding Negroes
by &#8220;tacit consent.&#8221; Today the SIU does not exclude Negroes but I
have been told that this international maintains a separate hiring
hall for Negroes in New York City. Also it should be remarked that
since Mr. Northrup wrote his book the courts of California have
upheld a petition of Negro members asking that the Boilermakers be
ordered to dissolve its auxiliary locals and to admit Negroes to the
regular locals. It is too early to say what the final results will
be, as the Boilermakers have appealed to a higher court.</p>
<p>Northrup contrasts the policies and practices of the AFL with
those of the CIO. He points out that in the first few years of its
existence the leaders of the AFL &#8220;apparently&#8221; made an effort to
live up to their &#8220;expressed policies of racial equality ... These
sentiments, however, were of short duration.&#8221; In this statement
Northrup reveals what is brought out throughout the book in those
parts dealing with interpretation: namely, that the author evaluates
the labor movement as just one of the important and significant
social movements in the American scene. The formation of the AFL was
a class in motion but this is not expressed in the book. The coming
of the AFL represented a class in motion, despite the fact that its
leaders failed to recognize this fact and its tremendous importance
for the future of organized labor in the U.S. The fact that the AFL
displaced the Knights of Labor despite the latter organization&#8217;s
equalitarian policies, demonstrated that there was objective need for
an organization <em>basing itself</em> on the skilled workers and
excluding some of the elements which were admitted to the Knights.
The AFL leaders did not live up to their &#8220;expressed policies of
racial equality&#8221; mainly for the reason that they did not recognize
American capitalist society as a class society and therefore did not
understand or agree that class solidarity across racial lines was
imperative for the health and vigor of the labor movement. The AFL
developed a &#8220;success&#8221; philosophy based on expansion among the
skilled workers.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Negroes in the Building Trades Unions</h4>
<p class="fst">Mr. Northrup begins his consideration of the several groupings in
the labor movement with the building trades. Since the space allotted
is not sufficient to discuss the author&#8217;s treatment in detail I can
only give what is of outstanding significance. He points out that
one-half of Negro skilled workers are in the building trades and that
of these, sixty per cent are in the South. The Negro lost ground in
the building trades due to the pressure of the white workers as
unionization proceeded. He goes into the attitude of the plumbers and
electricians in their efforts to bar Negro mechanics by finagling
with city councils to pass ordinances which worked hardships on
Negroes. Also both of these internationals adopted apprenticeship
standards which Negroes could not meet due to the discriminatory
practices of the unions themselves. The carpenters, although having
no formal discriminatory policy against Negroes, have found such
subtle ways of exclusion as confining Negro carpenters to the Negro
section of the community. In the South, the Carpenters&#8217;
International has not bothered to intercede in behalf of Negro
carpenters who were denied work on account of race. In this
connection Northrup relates the results of government intervention in
behalf of Negro carpenters in the case of federal public housing as
well as the opposition against equality for Negro mechanics voiced by
members of Congress.</p>
<p>The set-up in the Painters is similar to that of the Carpenters.
They too set up separate Negro locals. This has been done by the
Painters in the North to a greater extent than in the Carpenters. The
Painters also resort to various schemes to keep Negro workmen from
obtaining jobs.</p>
<p>Unlike the Carpenters and the Painters, the Bricklayers&#8217;
officers began a campaign &#8220;as early as 1870 ... to achieve equal
status for Negroes.&#8221; Unlike the Carpenters, the Bricklayers did not
adopt the separate local as a national policy. In his field survey in
1940&#8211;41 Northrup found separate Negro locals in only three cities,
all in the South. In this international too, however, the Negro
worker runs into difficulties in getting admitted to certain locals
and in getting his share of the work.</p>
<p>In 1940, 15.2 per cent of the plasterers in the country and 54.5
of those in the South were Negroes. This is accounted for by the ease
with which Negro hod carriers and plasterers&#8217; helpers may graduate
into the higher trade. Negro plasterers have less difficulties over
discriminatory practices than other Negro building craftsmen.</p>
<p>Northrup&#8217;s investigations serve to underscore and give the
concrete material to buttress what was generally known: that the
building trades unions of the AFL, all of them in one way or another,
discriminate against the Negro mechanic. These were the unions which
first came under notice and against which the main fire was directed
for the reason that it was these unions which sought jurisdiction in
the field occupied by the overwhelming majority of Negro skilled
workers.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Railroad Organizations and the Negro</h4>
<p class="fst">Northrup next deals with the railroad organizations and here he
tells a sordid story indeed. He says: &#8220;The Negro railroad worker is
in an anomalous position. He is denied a voice in the affairs of
nearly all railway labor organizations; yet collective bargaining on
the railroads has received wider acceptance than in almost any other
American industry.&#8221; He relates how violence has been used against
Negro railway workers by white union members, how the brotherhoods
have connived with railroad management to bar Negroes and
discriminate against them and how &#8220;since 1934&#8221; the brotherhoods
&#8220;have found federal agencies useful in accomplishing their
purpose.&#8221; The Engineers, in their jurisdictional quarrel with the
Firemen, have attempted to use the Negro firemen as pawns in the
game. On the Florida East Coast Railroad &#8220;the general chairman of
the Engineers&#8217; Union acted as representative for the Negro firemen
in return for monetary consideration.&#8221; Dr. William Leiserson,
chairman of the Railway Mediation Board, wrote to the Firemen and
Engineers suggesting that they withdraw a request for an election
because no matter what bargaining units resulted, the colored
employees would control the results for the particular region for
which the election was requested. James W. Carmalt, a member of the
board, wrote to the Engineers and Firemen that in the &#8220;Southeastern
region the Negro question interjects itself in that the B. of L.E.
are (<em>sic</em>) soliciting the votes of Negro firemen ... This
demonstrates the unhealthy condition that has grown in the relation
between the two organizations <em>when the votes of the colored
employees are used to determine white representation</em>.&#8221; Northrup
adds: &#8220;One cannot avoid receiving the impression that the board
regards collective bargaining in the train and engine services as
strictly a white man&#8217;s affair.&#8221; It is necessary to emphasize that
the Railway Mediation Board is a federal government board appointed
by the President.</p>
<p>Northrup goes over the whole miserable affair and closes by saying
that discrimination against the Negro railroad workers by the
employers and the unions &#8220;is assisted by the policies of government
agencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is one argument which Northrup makes which needs examination
because here again his point of view appears. He argues against a
suggestion which has been made to the effect that the Amended Railway
Labor Act should be extended to other industries because this Act has
made for industrial peace in the railroad industry. Northrup admits
that peace has been preserved &#8220;and due credit should be accorded to
the Railway Labor Act and its administrators for this laudable
accomplishment. But peace on the rails has had its price. One price
... is the acceptance by employers of obsolete made-work, or
&#8216;featherbed&#8217; working rules. Another has been the toleration of
intense discrimination against Negroes.&#8221;</p>
<p>We cannot agree to Northrup&#8217;s equating what is called
&#8220;featherbed&#8221; working rules with discrimination against Negroes or
any other group of workers. No matter what its merits or demerits
today, what is called &#8220;featherbedding&#8221; was devised by the unions
as a protection against unemployment due to technological changes and
covert anti-union acts of the</p>
<p>employers. All unions and the whole working class at some time or
another are confronted with this problem (one-man street cars, for
instance). Historically, made-work rules were an effort on the part
of labor to ward off unemployment due to the ups and downs in the
development of capitalist production and organization. These shifts
and developments affect all of labor. These demands of labor are
directed at and against the employer. Discrimination against Negroes
or any other group in the working class is not an act directed at the
employer but at the worker group discriminated against. This creates
a rift in the working class and operates against the interests of the
labor movement at any and all times. The basic reason that the
Railway Mediation Act should not be extended to cover other
industries is not that it tolerates &#8220;made-work&#8221; or even that its
administrators have promoted discrimination against Negroes. The
basic reason is that this act, in so far as it establishes government
control over unions, would be detrimental to the unions and to the
working class, including the Negroes. The experience of the unions
with the WLB, which is looked upon as a temporary war body, has
illustrated the danger of the intervention of capitalist government
into union affairs.</p>
<p>In March of this year, the Regional War Labor Board denied a
request of Radio Station WOV in New York City for permission to
reduce the number of musicians hired under contract with the American
Federation of Musicians. WOV charged &#8220;featherbedding&#8221; on the part
of the union. The regional board said that it had no authority to
&#8220;destroy or diminish privileges won by a local union through
collective bargaining.&#8221; The question as to what &#8220;featherbedding&#8221;
actually is in practice always arises. In the case cited, the radio
station planned to reduce the number of musicians from twelve, as
called for in the collective bargaining agreement, to five.
Furthermore, in these days of &#8220;government control,&#8221;
&#8220;feather-bedding&#8221; can become a very useful dodge to be used by
employers for contract breaking and by government boards for an
assault on the unions.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Organization of Separate Locals</h4>
<p class="fst">Northrup deals with a group of unions which are divided between
the CIO and AFL. Here are the Tobacco Workers; Textile, Clothing and
Laundries; Longshoremen and Shipbuilding Workers. In pre-Civil War
days tobacco, was grown and processed by Negro slaves. In the
industry today &#8220;whites operate the machines and weigh and pack the
final product ... The racial-occupation segregation pattern is made
practical because the stemming and blending and shredding departments
where the majority of Negroes are employed, have to be housed in
separate buildings, or at least on separate floors.&#8221; The jobs the
Negroes have are the least desirable because they work in the heat
and the dust. Furthermore there are wage differentials based on race.</p>
<p>The AFL Tobacco Workers Union forbids discrimination in its
constitution but has organized separate locals in the South. A new
administration elected in 1940 has adopted a policy of mixed unions
&#8220;wherever possible&#8221; and at the 1940 convention a Negro was
elected to a vice-presidency.</p>
<p>Few Negroes have ever been employed in the cotton textile industry
either North or South. In the South, &#8220;legislation demanding the
complete segregation of workers of the two races ... has not only
helped to institutionalize the exclusion of Negroes ... but has
assisted white workers to preempt most of the desirable work
opportunities.&#8221; In the South, the CIO Textile Workers Union has
adopted the policy of organizing separate locals for Negroes under
certain conditions. This is the case at a Virginia mill and. at the
Marshall Field Mills in North Carolina. &#8220;To the writer&#8217;s
knowledge,&#8221; says Northrup, &#8220;no other CIO affiliate has adopted
the separate Negro local as a union policy.&#8221; This means that the
Textile Workers Union &#8220;has accepted the racial employment pattern
in the industry.&#8221; The author doubts that the union can do otherwise
now because the TWU has only a small portion of the industry under
contract and to &#8220;advocate an alteration in the <em>status quo</em> at
this time would insure the Textile Workers Union, or any other
organization, complete defeat in the Southern textile mills.&#8221; I do
not believe that there is any warrant for this position. In the first
place, it smacks too much of the philosophy of the Southern
inter-racial committees, that is, it is too tinged with liberal
opportunism. Admitting that the poor whites in Southern textile mills
are an ignorant and very debased group of workers, there is no good
reason for approaching them in any fundamentally different way from
the miners and steel workers, for instance. Also, the way to organize
these backward textile workers and force contracts from the mill
owners is not to hold the very small Negro minority in the foreground
but the very large unorganized white majority already in the mills.
The mill owners at present are not so much concerned with Negroes who
are not present but the white workers who are now employed by the
thousands. They are not organized. The TWU has the task of pushing a
vigorous organization campaign in the South. The road to changing the
attitude of white workers toward Negroes is to get the white workers
organized; let them learn something about trade unionism and they
will at the same time learn the value of a different outlook on the
Negro worker. Any other attitude is to advocate the acceptance of
&#8220;the racial employment pattern in the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the same chapter Mr. Northrup relates that in Miami, Fla.,
separate locals of laundry workers were established by the Laundry
Workers Union, &#8220;but their charters were recently revoked and a new
charter for a mixed local granted instead. In most of the local
organizations Negroes are well&#8221; integrated, holding various offices
and being well represented as shop stewards.&#8221; It seems that what
the Laundry Workers could do in Miami, the Textile Workers might
attempt in South Carolina.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>&#8220;The Greater Tractability of Negroes&#8221;</h4>
<p class="fst">Northrup says that in longshore work one find emphasis on speed
and &#8220;in view of the greater tractability of Negroes in submitting
to continual prodding &#8211; a result of their inferior socio-economic
status &#8211; it is not difficult to imagine that many employers hire
them even when white workers are available at the same pay.&#8221; Here
Mr. Northrup sounds like a &#8220;car window&#8221; sociologist. He certainly
did not discover this about Negroes generally in the course of his
<em>investigations</em>. What often seems to be tractability on the
part of Negroes is often nothing more than a very astute physical
procedure for reducing physical exertion to the level of the pay
received without getting into conflict with a brutal but stupid
anti-Negro superintendent.</p>
<p>About ninety per cent of the longshoremen at Hampton Roads are
Negroes. Before 1900, the locals were entirely Negro. White workers
refused to join and &#8220;the colored longshoremen were finally
persuaded to consent to the issuance of a separate charter for white
men.&#8221; I suppose that one of the arguments made by the white men was
that if the situation were reversed and the Negroes wanted a separate
local, the whites would readily consent.</p>
<p>For the coal industry, Northrup holds that increasing
mechanization has injured Negro employment and &#8220;if past experience
is any guide, Negroes will suffer disproportionately heavy losses in
jobs ... These post-war adjustments will put the equalitarian
policies of the UMWA to their severest test.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the steel industry, Northrup finds that employment has tripled
since 1910 but that there was a decrease in the proportion of Negro
workers in the Thirties. This was due to personnel policies of the
corporations. Most of the Negroes were held in unskilled
classifications and were not therefore in the indispensable class.
The majority of Negroes in the industry remain in the unskilled
class. This is particularly true of the South. Equalitarian policies
have met more obstacles in steel than in coal. &#8220;Successful unionism
is newer,&#8221; there is a wider wage differential &#8220;between the
unskilled and skilled work&#8221; and there is more &#8220;job segregation&#8221;
in the steel industry.</p>
<p>Here again, however, it is necessary to remark that these are
problems for the unions to tackle and solve. There are all manner of
differences in the world in everything. It is true that it is easier
to open &#8220;all white&#8221; departments in steel than in coal. But all
white departments are just as unnecessary in steel as in coal. There
is nothing about the steel industry which makes some operations more
effectual if done by white workers. This is one of the problems for
the United Steel Workers to solve by effective and militant union
action.</p>
<p>How seniority is applied affects the welfare of Negro workers,
according to Northrup. The prevalence of departmental seniority
&#8220;accounts in large measure for the failure of the USA-CIO to open
up some all-white departments to Negroes. On the other hand, in
periods of depressed business ... departmental seniority works to the
advantage of Negroes ... where they are heavily concentrated in a few
departments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Northrup makes a queer and unexplained statement when he writes
that &#8220;Most companies prefer departmental seniority, for its
operation interferes the least with the established order of things,
and <em>hence has not the adverse effect on the efficiency of
operations which the application of plant seniority does</em>.&#8221; (My
emphasis. &#8211; <em>D.C.</em>) It is true that any seniority operations
interfere with the &#8220;order of things,&#8221; but just how does plant
seniority interfere with &#8220;efficiency of operations?&#8221; Which is
better for the union and the workers?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Negroes as Active Union Members</h4>
<p class="fst">In the automobile industry, Negroes are also predominantly in the
unskilled class. (Of course, there has been some change in all
industries since this book was published.) Northrup found that
generally Negroes had not been dealt with unfairly in layoffs. This
was largely due to the fact that they had acquired seniority in
departments where they were concentrated.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;On the other hand, a majority of Negroes have been
quite unsatisfied with the operation of departmental and occupational
seniority. They regard it as a thinly disguised ruse to keep them
concentrated in the poorer and more undesirable departments and
occupations.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">In the automobile industry, Northrup makes a statement on Negro
participation in union affairs similar to the one he makes about the
United Steel Workers. &#8220;UAW-CIO leaders continue to be hindered in
their attempts to secure equality of opportunity for Negroes by the
failure of Negroes in some plants to give the union their full
support.&#8221; He mentions the Flint Buick plant, where the union was
successful in getting 500 Negro foundry workers upgraded to
production. &#8220;Yet in July 1942 less than fifty per cent of the
Negroes were union members, as compared with ninety per cent of the
white workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is true that Negroes have been slow in getting into the union
and becoming active. However, it should not be expected that Negroes
will rush into a union merely through the impetus of one event in
which the local has succeeded in getting Negroes upgraded. Whereas
Negro workers have a single experience of the value of the union to
them, white workers in the same plant may have had a hundred such
experiences. It will take a long time to convince Negroes that
getting upgraded through the activity of the union will be a
permanent and regular experience in their working lives. There must
be no attitude that Negroes give thanks for any fight which unions
carry on against discrimination. This sounds too much like &#8220;remember
Abraham Lincoln.&#8221; What is necessary is the complete integration of
Negroes into the union, equality in the union, a persistent demand
for job equality and the education of Negroes in the principles of
trade unionism. If this is done more and more Negroes will join the
unions and become among the most active members.</p>
<p>Oh the aircraft industry, Northrup points out that &#8220;the
responsibility for excluding Negroes from the industry clearly rested
upon the management.&#8221; In those cases where the union or the.
international officers acted vigorously against Jim Crow the Negroes
rally to the CIO against the AFL, as was the case in Kansas City,
where the Negroes supported the UAW-CIO against the IAM-AFL.</p>
<p>Mr. Northrup deals with the AFL Metal Trades Department in his
discussion of the shipbuilding unions: with the Boilermakers&#8217; Jim
Crow auxiliaries, whose international removed the Negro exclusion
clause from its ritual in 1937 and resorted to the Negro auxiliary
set-up as a substitute. In a Tampa yard, where one-half of the
employees were Negroes, the Boilermakers and the Machinists did not
establish Negro auxiliaries but &#8220;used the closed-shop contract to
secure the dismissal of about 500 Negroes and the demotion of all but
two of the remainder to unskilled jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the CIO Shipbuilding Workers, the author deals with the
situation at the Sun Co., where a Jim Crow yard was established in
the midst of three nearly all-white yards. He also discusses the
situation in the yards on the Gulf Coast, where there have been many
difficulties in connection with Negro employment. He concludes as of
the date of the book that &#8220;serious attempts have not been made to
utilize Negro labor.&#8221; Negroes have had the best opportunities on
the Atlantic Coast in the yards under contract to the CIO
Shipbuilding Workers.</p>
<p>In his <em>Concluding Remarks</em>, Mr. Northrup expresses his point
of view on several complicated and controversial questions. He
observes that there is a tendency for &#8220;union racial policies to be
conditioned by their environment.&#8221; Unions have the habit of
accepting &#8220;the racial employment pattern of an industry.&#8221; He
finds that national officers &#8220;can and do take a more detached view
of the situation, to the resultant advantage of Negroes.&#8221; This is
probably true but in the AFL this &#8220;detached view&#8221; is usually
filled with a great deal of hocus-pocus and hypocrisy. In the CIO it
is certainly true that the national officers have been outstanding in
their efforts to wipe out discrimination both in the CIO unions and
in industry. But here too there are many things yet to be done.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Question of Government Intervention</h4>
<p class="fst">An important section deals with <em>Public Policy, the Negro and
Unions</em>. He asks the question: should unions which discriminate be
permitted to limit employment opportunities, to sign closed shop
contracts, to use public labor relations boards, or be designated as
the bargaining agent? Northrup makes a distinction between what he,
following the courts, calls &#8220;private institutions such as the
church or the Elks,&#8221; and &#8220;quasi-public institutions,&#8221; in which
category he places the unions. Mr. Northrup writes:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The claims of unions that they should be permitted to
govern their own affairs, free from government interference of any
sort, is a &#8216;sheer anachronism,&#8217; out of keeping with their actual
status in our present social organization ... Once unions are
admitted to be quasi-public institutions, it follows that their rules
and practices should be subject to some public scrutiny, and those
found contrary to the public interest should be forbidden.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">It is precisely by the acceptance of this premise that Congress
passed the Smith-Connally Act, that the no-strike pledge was
demanded, that the Little Steel formula was established and that
Roosevelt demanded passage of a National Service Act. The question
must be asked: What is a quasi-public institution? Unions are
institutions of a class, organized for the purpose of protecting the
interests of a class. They are or should be public in their relations
to the class which they represent. Implied in the demand of the
unions that they be free from government interference is the position
that government interference in the affairs of unions is interference
by another and a hostile class. The fact that this notion is usually
not explicit is only demonstrative of the lack of class-consciousness
and political understanding in the labor movement.</p>
<p>It is a tragedy in the labor movement that the unions do not
understand that they can hold to their discriminatory policies only
so long as the employers and the government have no need for the
services of the whole labor force. When, as at present, there is a
war to fight, the class interests of the employers and the government
will result in the intervention of the government by law and
administrative or presidential decree.</p>
<p>Mr. Northrup argues furthers, apropos the closed shop, that &#8220;it
seems quite sound, also, that unions which sign closed shop contracts
should also be subject to further regulation.&#8221; Also the existence
of &#8220;race wage differential&#8221; indicates &#8220;the need for strong
governmental action.&#8221; We agree with and support Mr. Northrup&#8217;s
very laudable attitude against the discrimination and Jim Crow. But
we do not agree with the cure which he proposes, namely, government
intervention or control. Even the most ordinary workers have acquired
an education in the meaning of government intervention in the &#8220;public
interest&#8221; through their experiences with the &#8220;public&#8221; members
of the WLB.</p>
<p>Negroes may profit materially, for the time being, by virtue of
government action against discriminatory unions but as a section of
the working class they have suffered along with the white workers
from the government and employer restrictions on the functioning of
the unions. The organization of the CIO did more to advance the
interests of Negroes and Negro labor than all the government
intervention in the twentieth century.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Liberal and the &#8220;Public&#8221;</h4>
<p class="fst">In advocating government regulation as a cure for racial
discrimination, Mr. Northrup takes the viewpoint of the middle-class
liberal in setting up an entity known as the &#8220;public&#8221; and then
arguing for action in the &#8220;public interest.&#8221; This attitude, as we
have remarked, ignores the class organization of capitalist society
and the further fact that unions are basically class institutions
participating in a struggle between classes. As the working class
develops greater class-consciousness and the Negro worker becomes
more firmly integrated thereby into the labor movement, Jim Crow and
discrimination will tend to vanish and the solidarity of labor will
be increased.</p>
<p>Despite his point of view for government regulation, Mr. Northrup
seems to agree with this position. He writes: &#8220;The overwhelming
bulk of organized labor ... has everything to gain from continued
improvements in the economic status of Negroes.&#8221; Also &#8220;it is
difficult to understand how Negroes can improve their lot without the
aid of organized labor. It is therefore obvious that Negro workers
who want unions to continue their fight for equal opportunity must
join and support the unions.&#8221;</p>
