<h3>Relief of Hungry: A Political Question</h3>

<p class="fst">Mr. Roosevelt wants us to tighten our belts so that more food can
go to the hungry people of Europe. At least that&rsquo;s the reason
he gave for the belt-tightening. He says that we just can&rsquo;t let
the people of Europe starve.</p>

<p>The working class in the U.S. should certainly be concerned over
the plight of the European and Asiatic workers. But before we pull up
our belts to another hole we ought to have sense enough to
investigate the food situation to discover whether or not it is
necessary for us to reduce our food consumption in order to feed the
workers of Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>Labor doesn&rsquo;t know how much food is being produced, how much
goes to the military establishment, how much is being sent to
countries overseas, how much is packed away in storage, how much
finds its way into what the capitalists call &ldquo;the black
market,&rdquo; nor how much is rotting on farms, in warehouses, in
cold storage and in produce yards.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know how much the Army and Navy are wasting, nor
just exactly what the meat packers, the butter people and the canners
are doing with their commodities in order to force their government
to grant them permission to boost prices.</p>

<p>All we know is that the bureaucracy in Washington issues orders
which we are forced to obey. We are forced to obey because we are
just little people who have done the work from Pharaoh&rsquo;s
pyramids to the last tank off the Chrysler production line.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we don&rsquo;t know where the food goes that is sent
to &ldquo;feed Europe.&rdquo; We want to feed the workers of Europe,
Asia and Africa. We don&rsquo;t want our sacrifices used to stifle
the workers of the world. We don&rsquo;t want our sacrifices to go to
reestablish the runaway monarchical cowards on their thrones again.</p>

<p>As the United Nations armies proceed with their conquest of
Europe, the kings, queens, and presidents, who ran off and left their
&ldquo;subjects&rdquo; to face the lash of the Gestapo, are returning
from their hideouts in London, Washington and Long Island. They bring
up the rear of the conquering armies of the Big Three like so many
scavengers.</p>

<p>The food inquiry now being pursued by Congress is, to be sure, a
political move by anti-Roosevelt hatchet men. But that&rsquo;s all
right. The working class must take advantage of every rift, every
dispute in the ranks of the ruling class arid use it to our
advantage. We can be sure that if the truth were known, Roosevelt&rsquo;s
belt-tightening quip has some connection with bureaucratic
skullduggery and collaboration in Washington between the food
monopolists and the government at Washington.</p>
