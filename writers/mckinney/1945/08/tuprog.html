<p class="fst">The present article in this series is addressed primarily to the
white workers in the organized labor movement: CIO, AFL and the
railway brotherhoods. The demand contained in the subtitle is urged
upon the white workers. The main body of the working class does not
and cannot have genuine social equality in capitalist society. That
is, the white workers themselves do not have social equality, in the
fundamental sense. We will have more to say on this point later.</p>

<p>The white worker has a degree of political and economic equality
in the sense that white workers are not denied the right to vote by
direct legal act any place in the country, nor are they denied
employment on the basis of their color. It is only the Negro who
faces Jim Crow socially, politically and in a special and unique
manner. It is the purpose of this article to discuss the attitudes of
white and Negro workers toward each other, to discover the source of
clearly apparent antagonisms and to suggest the working-class means
for the resolution of this conflict within the working class.</p>

<p>We realize the difficulties and complexities inherent in any
attempt at a frank discussion of this problem as it exists in the
United States. But the only way to approach the question is in the
frankest and most vigorous manner. This method of approach is
indicated for the reason that the working class is rent asunder by
hatreds. It is the rock upon which the working class dashes about and
remains divided and disunited. It is an apple of discord thrown into
the ranks of labor to keep labor divided in the interest of ruling
class peace-of-mind and domination. Workers on both sides, so to
speak, have very strong opinions and attitudes on the question of
their relation one with the other.</p>

<p>Oftentimes these attitudes are extremely irrational and are held
to without rhyme or reason. The leader of a strike in Philadelphia,
called to protest the employment of Negroes on the street railway,
gives as his reason for opposition to working with Negroes that:
&#8220;Negroes carry bed bugs. We sit on wooden benches in the car house
and wood breeds bedbugs.&#8221; The question of admitting Negroes to a
machinist&#8217;s local of the AFL is under discussion in a meeting of
the local. A member takes the floor to object to the admission of
Negroes working in the plant because, &#8220;I hate the black s&#8213;bs.&#8221;
A very militant white worker is against Negroes because &#8220;they are
savages.&#8221; A young white worker who was defending the rights of
Negroes was reproached with the question: &#8220;You must want your
sister to marry a nigger.&#8221; A white worker rises in the UAW
convention to object to the resolution demanding equality for Negroes
because &#8220;I would not want my wife and daughter to mix with Negroes
at our convention.&#8221; The management of a plant decides under
pressure from the union to upgrade Negroes. A member of the 7-man
negotiating committee begins circulating a petition in his department
against the admission of upgraded Negroes to that department. Members
of a railway union organize a reign of terror against Negro firemen.
In numerous instances where the announcement has been made that
Negroes would be promoted to skilled jobs there have been strikes.</p>

<p>In a steel mill, two Negroes are promoted to a department where
Negroes have not worked before. Two white workers, one a union
member, begin the circulation of a petition against them. They give
as their reason for not wanting to work with Negroes that &#8220;Negroes
smell bad.&#8221; The superintendent added to the ludicrousness of the
situation by telling these two workers that he got very close to the
two Negro workers while they were in his office and &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
smell anything.&#8221; Right at the time that Hitler was crushing the
Poles in Poland, Polish workers in a northern city were raising
furious objection to a plan of the Federal Housing Authority to erect
a project to be occupied by Negroes in an area where the Poles lived.</p>

<p>Hundreds of instances of this kind could be given but these are
enough to illustrate the situation concretely. It is interesting to
compare these statements and attitudes of white workers with
statements and attitudes of certain white people outside the working
class. Senator Bilbo, of Mississippi, announces in the Senate that
&#8220;all history and biology prove that the white race has been the
leader of civilization for the past 6,000 years.&#8221; Senator Eastland
of the same state tells the world that the &#8220;white boys in the
Pacific are fighting for white supremacy.&#8221; A judge in the
Scottsboro case announced that &#8220;no white woman would voluntarily
give herself to a Negro.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Workers Imitate Employers</h4>

<p class="fst">The point which we are making is that the white workers as a rule
take the same attitude toward Negroes and Negro workers as that
assumed by the white bourgeoisie: the industrialists, financiers,
Republican and Democratic Party leaders and government functionaries.
Negroes assume similar attitudes: A Negro waiter on a dining car
intones that it is not Negroes whose writing is difficult to read but
&#8220;it&#8217;s these white folks who come in here who can&#8217;t write.&#8221; A
Negro worker expresses the opinion that &#8220;hunkies can live cheaper
than we can because all they eat is black bread and onions.&#8221; A
Negro soldier is convinced that &#8220;the Japanese are savages.&#8221; Negro
workers have stated that &#8220;the foreigners take our jobs.&#8221; &#8220;If I
had a black chicken and a white chicken came around I would kill the
white chicken,&#8221; &#8220;a white man is a white man and the white man in
the union is no different from a white man anywhere else.&#8221;</p>

<p>White workers block up against Negro candidates for office in the
unions and &#8220;plug&#8221; for a white candidate, purely on racial
grounds. The unions under the leadership of the white workers permit
the company to discriminate against and Jim Crow Negro workers. AFL
unions bar Negroes from membership and hold Negroes out of employment
under closed shop agreements. In all sections of the labor movement
locals or groups of white members object to Negroes attending social
affairs given by the union on the ground that they are against
&#8220;social equality.&#8221; All of these are common practices and
attitudes found everywhere, to one degree or other, in the trades
unions. It is necessary to unearth the roots and the source of these
attitudes on the part of white workers. The attitude of Negro workers
is essentially a defense set-up against the anti-Negro practices of
white trade unionists.</p>

<p>The labor movement and the white workers act in this reactionary
manner under the impact of capitalist society. It is a demonstration
of the fact that <i>no</i> institution is immune from the
all-prevailing miasma of a putrid social order whose devotees profit
materially from this fratricidal strife in the labor movement and the
working class. Workers enter the factory and the union out of the
capitalist world, enveloped in all the prejudices, hatreds,
puerilities, psychological distortions and social fabrications of
bourgeoisie society. The workers, white and black, live in a
capitalist social order encompassed about with every tangible and
concrete device necessary for the maintenance of the class supremacy
of the bourgeoisie and the breeding of internecine conflict among the proletarians.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of propaganda, the subtlest means used to keep
white and black workers embroiled in bitterness and hatred is the
doctrine of the superiority of the white race and the inferiority of
the Negro. This propaganda and agitation seep through the whole
national scene and enter every nook and cranny of human
relationships. For the country at large this is well understood. What
is difficult for Negroes to understand is why such attitudes are
prevalent in the labor movement. It is the purpose of this article to
give an exposition of the reasons for this phenomenon.</p>

<p>We say that the base for hatred between black and white workers is
laid when it is established in the mind of the white proletarian or
other white toiler that the Negro is inferior. The white worker
quoted does not want Negroes in his union because they are &#8220;savages&#8221;
and of course it is well understood that savages are an inferior
breed. They are &#8220;dirty,&#8221; &#8220;diseased,&#8221; &#8220;ignorant,&#8221; give off
an &#8220;offensive odor,&#8221; etc., etc. It is not that the Negro worker
is literally a savage, rather he is only one step removed from the
savage state. He is therefore not a person one sits beside, works
with, eats with or dances with. &#8220;Negroes don&#8217;t make good union
men,&#8221; they are &#8220;scabs,&#8221; &#8220;difficult to organize,&#8221; &#8220;won&#8217;t
pay their dues.&#8221;</p>

<p>The white worker has these notions drilled into him day and day
out; year and year out. Not always in the crude and semi-illiterate
manner of a Bilbo but far more effectively by distortions of
bourgeois historians, journalists, publicists and the mumb-jumbo
written by sociologists and political scientists in the name of
science and scientific method. These bourgeois scholars, academic
sorcerers, with their ill-founded generalizations, really plant the
seed which flowers into the ignorant but articulate and vicious
demagogues who infest the Congress, state legislatures, newspaper
offices and other public institutions. One can prove this to oneself
by consulting some of the school histories, especially those sections
dealing with slavery and the Negro today. Also many of the
sociological treatises have been responsible for a great deal of
rubbish about race which with some people passes for science. For
instance, in their discussions of &#8220;miscegenation&#8221; it is always a
white man and a Negro woman. Reading these &#8220;investigations&#8221; one
would never get the idea that &#8220;miscegenation&#8221; takes place the
other way round. One of the judges in the Scottsboro Case concluded
that these Negro boys must be guilty of rape because &#8220;no white
woman would willingly give herself to a Negro.&#8221; This judge of
course knew that this was a lie, but there are simple-minded white
folk who could be made to believe it.</p>

<p>The white worker also receives a daily training in the concept of
superior and inferior races from federal, state and municipal
governments. He learns that Negroes are Jim Crowed by the government,
that the federal government does not enforce the 14th and 15th
amendments, that Negroes and white people are always placed into
separate units in the Army, that the Navy has a tradition that
Negroes are neither to serve nor be transported on battleships.</p>

<p>For decades the white worker has been taught through the practices
of capitalist employers that Negro workers are confined to the
menial, dirty, heavy, the lowest paying and most undesirable jobs.
The white worker has become accustomed to seeing Negroes pushing the
trucks, sweeping the floor, running the elevator, slaving at the coke
oven or in the foundry. He is not accustomed to seeing Negroes in the
company office, in the engineering or drafting departments or as part
of the sales force. It is understood that Negro women can be only
domestics, cotton pickers or scrubwomen. These practices in
conjunction with the writing, speeches and lectures of the
publicists, politicians and teachers, thoroughly indoctrinate the
white worker with the idea of white superiority and Negro
inferiority. Consequently when the white worker enters the factory he
carries the ideas, notions and prejudices with him which he has
acquired in capitalist society. On this, as well as other questions,
he thinks as the leaders of capitalist society want him to think. His
social theories as well as his economic ideas are not his own but
those of the capitalist ruling class.</p>

<p>Such a white worker, and this type is the overwhelming majority,
therefore thinks of the factory as a white factory, the union becomes
a white man&#8217;s organization, because they both exist in a &#8220;white
man&#8217;s country,&#8221; with a white man&#8217;s government, a white man&#8217;s
army fighting a white man&#8217;s war, white business enterprises, white
amusement places and restaurants, big league ball clubs, YMCA&#8217;s and
churches. He often resents Negroes being employed in &#8220;his plant,&#8221;
opposes his promotion to a &#8220;white man&#8217;s job,&#8221; his running for
office in a white man&#8217;s union, or his attending a dance given by
this white man&#8217;s union. Being white is alone enough in the thinking
of the white worker to make him superior to the Negro.</p>

<p>This quality of whiteness with the attendant propaganda, tradition
and pseudo-science produces a queer mental state in the white worker.
The doctrine of the superiority of the white race and the inferiority
of the Negro creates for the white worker, a feeling of oneness with
the ruling class: with the employers, financiers and big government
officials. This thing called the white race is a mystical entity, a
hallowed group, a pure strain whose purity and thousand-year-old
achievements must be kept inviolate and isolated from contamination
by contact, as equals, with &#8220;inferior&#8221; races. The indoctrination
of the white worker with ideas of Negro racial inferiority and white
supremacy creates a harmony-of-interests attitude on the part of the
white worker toward his employer, his congresssman and even toward
the policeman on his block. On the question of Negroes the white
proletarian closes ranks with every section of the white population
except that small minority of white people who reject the race
superiority myth and the resultant practices. This minority become
&#8220;nigger lovers,&#8221; and a serious threat to &#8220;white supremacy.&#8221;
The white worker can eat with the general manager of the plant, he
can get a room in the same hotel as Ford or Truman, he can ride in
the same car with Col. McCormick of the <b>Chicago Tribune</b>. Or so
he believes, and the real situation in this connection is a subject
unexplored and totally misunderstood by the average white worker.</p>

<p>His acceptance of this hocus-pocus about race and race superiority
envelops the white worker in a cloud of ignorance, superstition,
anti-labor practices and class collaboration. The whole set-up of
capitalist exploitation and the class organization of capitalist
society becomes obscured. By their blind adherence to the notion of
white superiority and Negro inferiority, the white proletarians
stultify the class struggle and defeat the purpose for which the
trade-union movement exists. In the mass production industries where
the majority of them receive the same pay as the Negroes,they solace
themselves on the propaganda, put over by the ruling class, that
although they receive the same pay as the &#8220;inferior&#8221; Negroes,
they belong to a superior race, to the race that maintains &#8220;white
supremacy.&#8221; They belong to the race which owns the biggest bank in
the world, the tallest building on earth, which operates the richest
university in the world, which operates extra-fare luxurious trains,
which owns the most palatial dwellings: these white workers belong to
a race which pays itself billions in dividends and interest every
year, to a race which gorges itself on the finest food brought from
every corner of the earth. The white proletarian accepts this
situation as part of his pay. Although his pay envelope may contain
the same amount as the Negro on the next machine, this white worker
nevertheless permits himself to be drugged with the propaganda of a
superior and an inferior race.</p>

<p>The Negro worker along with other Negroes is given a status in
society, similar to the status of the serf in feudal society. The
Negro is assigned a place and is expected to &#8220;know his place.&#8221; By
his actions, the white worker divides capitalist society into two
groups: Negroes and white people. The &#8220;white&#8221; group includes all
white people: the employing ruling class, the middle class and the
white working class. The Negro group includes all Negroes: the Negro
banker and businessman, the professional group and the black worker.</p>

<p>Workers acquire such reactions mainly for the reason that the
working class has not yet developed the habit, in its thinking, of
inquiring into the source, the history and the roots of any body of
opinion which is disseminated in society. Concepts, notions and
propaganda are accepted uncritically and without any thought as to
what effect such doctrines may have on the working class as a whole.
For instance, workers and others use the term &#8220;race&#8221; as though
they really knew what they were talking about. (The pamphlet, <b>Races
of Mankind</b>, should do yeoman service in dispelling these
illusions and this ignorance.) They do not know that no reputable and
competent biologist, anthropologist or sociologist would dare come
out today with the statement that there are superior and inferior
races. Anthropologists definitely discount and reject the notion of
race as ordinarily understood. There are no pure races. They are all
mixed. This can be demonstrated to anyone in the U.S. except to the
most obtuse or to those who profit from the propagation of this myth
in some material or social way. This doctrine is often spread around
by those who know that it is not true. The South is the hot-bed of
this nonsense and it is very significant that in this section, where
the greatest amount of mixing has gone on, we find the most
pronounced talk about the purity of the white race. It is interesting
that genealogical organizations, whose business it is to trace one&#8217;s
ancestry, do not do a very extensive business in the South. Many
Southerners, when they find it necessary or expedient to account for
some seeming &#8220;impurity&#8221; in their lineage, are in the habit of
discovering that they are descended from some Indian chief or
princess. (Pocahontas is a very popular ancestor for white Virginians.)</p>

<p>Suppose, however, the scientists, whose business it is to be
acquainted with such things as race and &#8220;racial characteristics,&#8221;
were of the opinion that there are superior and inferior races. What
would this mean? What would they be talking about? Of what
significance would such theories or discoveries have for the working
class? That is, what social, economic or political importance would
such a theory have for wage earners? How could white workers use such
a theory to improve their material status, their political and
economic position in capitalist society? Would employers be inclined
to raise the wages of the white workers because these workers were of
a group which was &#8220;superior&#8221; to the group which Negro workers
belonged to? Will lay-offs during &#8220;reconversion&#8221; be determined by
considerations of racial superiority or inferiority? If this is the
case, is it not true that during the last depression, the only people
on the relief rolls would have been Negroes and other non-white
workers? Furthermore, one would suppose that employers would never
object to collective bargaining agreements except where Negroes are
to be covered by the contract. Also, one would think that the federal
government which also is a practitioner of race superiority and
Jim-Crow, would only deny maintenance of membership after strikes in
cases where the strikers were members of the &#8220;inferior&#8221; race. In
the case of military conscription, one should draw the inference that
only members of the inferior race would have to be drafted since
their very inferiority would mean that they had no proper. notions
about patriotism, the defense of civilization and of &#8220;our noble
institutions.&#8221; We can add another inference. That is, we should
expect our Jim-Crow federal government to do more than merely
segregate Negroes in separate regiments. We should expect them to
keep the members of the superior race at home and let the inferiors
go to the jungles of Burma, the reptile-infested fastnesses of the
Pacific and brave the vicissitudes of German prison camps. It might
be replied that these are deeds for men of heroic mold, pastimes for
the brave, the chivalrous and the noble.</p>

<p>Some white workers will be inclined to say that what we say here
is merely ludicrous and fantastic. Perhaps so, but what makes it
ludicrous and fantastic? Only the brute fact that many white workers
act toward the Negro workers as though these things were true and
actual. If white workers do not believe the &#8220;ludicrous&#8221; ideas
which we express above, they will have to express such disbelief in
action. They must base their changed actions on their discovery of
the facts of life as it is in capitalist society: a social order
based on the ownership of the means of production by a class and the
use of the productive forces for the extraction of private profit.</p>

<p>They will have to divest themselves of quack notions about race
and begin thinking in terms of working class and ruling class. They
will have to throw off all ideas of superior and inferior races and
begin to understand that in capitalist society, the attempt to divide
mankind into races can have no value for the working class, which as
a whole is exploited and oppressed by the capitalist ruling class all
over the world. On the basis of this fundamental idea it will become
clear that what is important for the working class is not what race
or nationality one belongs to but rather which class is he a part of.</p>
