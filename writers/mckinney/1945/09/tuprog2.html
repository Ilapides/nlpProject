<p class="fst">White workers have an abundance of evidence at hand in their past
experience with the capitalist employers to teach them that what we
say here is true. White workers acquiesced in the barring of Negroes
from skilled and semi-skilled occupations for decades. Some of them
went so far as to write in their union constitutions that Negroes
could not be members. They participated in pogroms against Negro
workers. They collaborated with anti-Negro employers and used their
closed shop agreements to keep Negroes off the job. They engaged in
strikes against the hiring or the upgrading of Negroes. But when the
Second Imperialist World War rolled around with unprecedented demand
for increased production, the capitalists and their government did
not hesitate to raze the job barriers against Negroes and induct
hundreds of thousands of them into &#8220;white&#8221; jobs. The Negro lost
his inferiority, at least to a considerable degree. The protestations
of white workers availed them nothing. The FEPC appeared. There were
presidential decrees against the barring of Negroes. Capitalist
employers discovered that Negroes were as good workmen as white men.
They even expressed disagreement when white women objected to working
with Negro women.</p>

<p>The contention that &#8220;Negroes are savages&#8221; did not seem to be a
matter of any importance. The lathes, punch presses and welding
apparatus did not seem to be concerned with whether or not the
&#8220;hands&#8221; that operated them were black or white. The owners of the
machines also did not bother about the niceties of social theory and
practice. For the time being at least these were things for the
erudition of a backwoods Bilbo, the gentlemen of the professorial
chair, the editorial office and the street corner. When a big war is
on, there are capitalist profits to be made and gold is neither black
nor white. Fifteen per cent on one&#8217;s investment or an annual salary
of $100,000 wrung out of the sweat and blood of a black worker will
buy just as many mansions, cocktails, and chorus girls as the same
amount from the labor of a white worker. Capitalist profit really
knows no color line. The African native toiling in the Transvaal gold
fields, concentration camps, the Nicaraguan peon writhing under the
lash of the slave drivers of the United Fruit Company, the Chinese
coolie sweating out profits for the British imperialists, the Indian
laborer bowed under the weight of the whole British ruling class, the
Negro sharecropper of the South eking out his inhuman existence on
sow belly and corn meal, the Mexican peon enriching the Associated
&#8220;Farmers&#8221; of California, stand no lower in the estimation of the
capitalist masters than the &#8220;aristocracy of labor&#8221; in the most
highly skilled of the AFL craft unions.</p>

<p>The white worker who does not understand these things is in fact a
very naive individual. He believes everything that he is told. He is
a glutton for error, myth, ignorance and superstition. He sees the
employers and the government crack down on his Negro exclusionist
policies during the war and his only reaction is: &#8220;Just wait until
the war is over and we&#8217;ll get rid of the niggers.&#8221; How does he
know he will, and what does he mean by &#8220;get rid of?&#8221; White
workers have never understood that the preferment which has been
theirs all these decades was neither basically a matter of the
capitalist employers being pro-white labor or anti-Negro labor but
what best serves the interest of capitalism at a certain time or in a
certain locality. The ruling class always seeks to divide and rule.
The atomization of the working class has not been promoted by the
ruling class in the relations between black and white workers but
also between skilled and unskilled, male and female, children and
adults, natives and &#8220;foreigners,&#8221; Jew and Gentile, northerner and
southerner, urban and rural.</p>

<p>We have said that these phenomena in the ranks of the white
workers are the result of the impact of capitalist society on the
working class: the penetration of the working class by ideas which
should be cast out as alien and inimical to the welfare of the
proletariat as a class. A united and class conscious ruling class
parades before the working class with slogans and ideas which if
accepted by the workers can only lead to strife, disruption and
disintegration of the working class front. The fact that the economic
problem facing the white worker is the same problem faced by the
Negro does not impress itself on the white worker. He has a feeling
that because he is white, he is entitled to more and better. The
capitalist employers, knowing full well that the root of the problem
is capitalism itself and the search for capitalist profits, seek
always to keep the white worker disoriented and safe in the tow path
of race and race superiority.</p>

<p>The root problem is the job problem. Under capitalism there are
not, will not and cannot be enough jobs for all the people. Those who
work can never hope to receive adequate wages or a high enough
standard of living. Capitalist profits and a high standard of living
for the masses are incommensurable. White workers act as though they
believed that if there were no Negroes in the U.S., they would have
no economic difficulties. If this is true then Bilbo and the Negro
chauvinists have the solution white workers are looking for more
jim-crow, complete separation or giving the Negroes a country of
their own. It is extremely difficult, however, to grasp how a white
worker can accept such nonsense. To believe this is to believe that
12 or so million Negro workers are the main obstacle to the economic
welfare of 40 to 50 millions of white workers. And not only this but
the 50 millions Belong to the superior race and the 12 millions are
cursed with the badge of inferiority.</p>

<p>It is a most sorrowful predicament that the white workers have
permitted themselves to be pushed into. Fifty millions of them have
developed the conception that they can enhance or sustain their
present economic, social and political position by keeping Negroes
common laborers, by segregating them into Jim Crow departments, by
disenfranchisement, by forcing them to live in Negro ghettoes, by mob
violence, terrorism and lynching. This is the way the white worker
attacks the problem of capitalist exploitation, of profit grabbing
and imperialist war. If there are no Negroes around the capitalists
will agree among themselves not to have any more depressions. If
there were no Negroes involved, the capitalists and the government
would reconvert to peace-time production at a faster tempo, they
would never attack seniority and no white worker would ever be fired
and rehired at a lower rate Of pay. Any employer who violated the
sacredness of this arrangement would be branded by the National
Association of Manufacturers, as a betrayer of the white race. If
such events occurred in the South, that would be betrayal of the
South and an insult to southern white womanhood.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The Roots of Negro Aggressiveness</h4>

<p class="fst">And thus the white worker attempts to rise on the backs of the
Negro toilers. He attempts to solve the problems of capitalist
created scarcity by demanding only a meagre portion for his children
and starvation of the child of the black worker. He demands a cheap
pair of shoes for his wife and is satisfied if the wife of the Negro
worker goes barefoot. He confines his efforts to getting some kind of
shelter for himself and drives the black worker into the unspeakable
cabins of the cotton fields and the vermin infested hovels of the big
cities. This is what the white worker has learned in capitalist
society. This is what he has imbibed from the capitalist press, the
capitalist school, the capitalist pulpit and the capitalist
government. This is the halter which the ruling class has drawn
around the neck of the white working class, the blinders which this
class has placed over its own eyes.</p>

<p>Quite often white workers resent aggressiveness on the part of
Negroes. I have heard them say that Negroes &#8220;push too hard&#8221; for
their rights. Negroes are too &#8220;uppity.&#8221; &#8220;They should take
things a little easy.&#8221; Here these white workers are only producing
an echo. That is what he reads in the capitalist press. That is what
he hears from white &#8220;friends of the Negro,&#8221; and white enemies of
the Negro. That is the kind of advice the Negro gets from certain
white liberals, especially the southern white &#8220;liberals.&#8221; The
white worker should stop and ask himself: what or whom is the Negro
pushing against? What are the roots of this aggressiveness? Does the
Negro push too much against the employer? If so, this is good. The
white workers themselves need a few practical lessons in this type of
pushing. If the Negro worker gives them this lesson, we say &#8220;well
and good.&#8221; That is a much needed contribution that militant Negro
workers can make to the labor movement.</p>

<p>Do the Negro workers push too hard against the officers of a local
which collaborates with the employer in discrimination against
Negroes? We will support wholeheartedly this type of pushing also and
every white worker who is against discrimination should do likewise.
And without hesitation or qualification. Do Negroes demand in a most
aggressive manner, their democratic rights in all phases of national
life? The Workers Party supports this type of pushing also and every
white worker should go arm in arm with the Negroes in this demand.</p>

<p>Are Negroes angry in the United States today? Do they at times
give vent to their anger in foolish ways? Do they at times react in
an incorrect manner toward white workers? To be sure they do, but who
are the white workers to rise in such righteous indignation against
them? How did the Negroes get into this condition? Is the white
working class ready to pretend that it has made no contribution to
this situation?It can be only a pretense because the Negro worker has
had many sad experiences with the white working class during the past
decades since his emancipation. The Negro has been oppressed and
exploited by the white ruling class and maltreated and oppressed by
the white working class. In his political and social immaturity he
has not always understood how to make the proper distinction between
the &#8220;boss&#8221; and the white worker. The Negro worker and the white
worker both have been victims of the same capitalist poison
propaganda. White workers should therefore ask themselves whom and
what Negroes &#8220;push&#8221; against. Do they push against the union and
when? Do they push against the employer and when?</p>

<p>Here too the white worker is thinking in terms of race and not of
class. It is race against race. The militant and aggressive Negro in
the factory is not a worker with a grievance against the company or
the local, or the international. He becomes a Negro who &#8220;wants to
be as good as a white man. The white worker develops a grievance
against the Negroes and at times expresses this resentment by
collaborating with the company.</p>

<p>Do Negro workers who come North for example, try to move into
&#8220;white neighborhoods&#8221; after they have accumulated a few dollars
and become accustomed to a higher standard of living? To be sure they
do. Is this one other mark of inferiority? Does the white worker
expect the Negro to act in any different way from the white worker.
The white worker from Mississippi or Arkansas, who has come North to
escape the horrors and misery of &#8220;Tobacco Road,&#8221; to escape the
low wages and the meagre standard of living of the South, begins to
fix himself up as soon as he has made a few days&#8217; pay. The Negro
who has left the South or the slums of the North, does likewise. He
moves into a &#8220;white neighborhood.&#8221; Why? Because he has only one
aim in life: to live beside a white man? The white worker who thinks
this is really too stupid to be entitled to opinion on any question
whatsoever. The Negro goes to the &#8220;white neighborhood&#8221; because
here he finds the most modern houses, the best paved streets, the
most up-to-date school buildings, fewer brothels, whiskey shops,
factories and dumps.</p>

<p>Instead of the white working class welcoming this move by the
Negro, quite often a mob is organized to drive Negroes back to the
slums and shanty-towns from which they came. What are the white
workers protecting when they act in this manner? Whose property?
Their own property? Nonsense; they own no property. Even those white
workers, particularly in small communities, who have a little home of
their own, discover every so often that they do not own anything; not
even the house on which they pay taxes to the capitalist state. The
white working class renters who object to Negro neighbors are victims
of the propaganda of the big property owners and real estate
operators who say that &#8220;Negroes depress property values,&#8221; Why
should white workers be interested in maintaining &#8220;property
values?&#8221; It is not their property. They, like other wage-earners,
own no property. The property is owned by the banks, landlords,
insurance companies: that is, by the capitalist exploiters of all the
workers; black and white. If Negroes depress property values, that in
itself is a good reason for any white worker to welcome the arrival
of Negroes.</p>

<p>Do Negroes want to eat in &#8220;white&#8221; restaurants? Of course they
do. They want to eat where other people eat and where it is most
convenient to eat. Why do white workers object? The proprietor says
that if he serves Negroes he will lose his trade. Why will he lose
his trade? Because white workers will not eat with Negroes or rent a
room in a hotel if the proprietor accommodates Negroes? But we ask
any white worker: &#8220;What interest can you have in refusing to eat in
a restaurant which serves Negroes or live in a hotel which rents a
room to a Negro?&#8221; Assuming that there is a loss if Negroes are
served or accommodated, is it the white worker who suffers the loss?
How many white workers own hotels, restaurants, theatres, railroads
or bus lines? In what way to white workers profit by the exclusion of
Negroes? Does the hotel keeper reduce their room rent, the cafe owner
the prices of the meal, the railroad the cost of the ticket or the
landlord the amount of the rent? If none of this, then what? A
feeling of racial superiority? This is very poor material to use as a
foundation for economic security, for the building of the unions, for
the struggle against the employers, or for the organization of
working class political action.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The Bogey of Social Equality</h4>

<p class="fst">The white worker has one stock argument against Negro equality
which is likely to be pulled out at the drop of the hat. That is his
obsession with what he calls &#8220;social equality.&#8221; &#8220;How would you
like for your sister to marry a Negro?&#8221; It is expected that this
question will floor any white worker who has been advocating that
Negroes should have the right to a job, to live in a decent house, to
eat in a &#8220;white&#8221; restaurant or ride on a train like other people.
&#8220;How would you feel if you looked up and saw your girl friend
dancing with a Negro?&#8221; For fear that the &#8220;girl friend&#8221; might
forget herself and dance with one of the Negro members of the union,
such a worker takes the position that Negro members should not be
allowed to attend union social affairs.</p>

<p>Years ago I heard a southern congressman say in the House that he
went into the Washington Union Station and there was no place &#8220;for
my wife and daughter to set. Every place they went they would have to
set by a darky.&#8221; The white union member who talks about &#8220;social
equality&#8221; in the way which is prevalent among these workers is
taking the identical attitude as this congressman. If Negroes just
must use the trains then let them have a separate waiting room and a
separate coach. If Negroes insist on joining &#8220;our unions&#8221; then
let them have their own department, their own washrooms and their own
social affairs.</p>

<p>This attitude on the part of white workers is reactionary In more
ways than one. It assumes that men should control the lives of women
and dictate to their wives, sisters and sweet- hearts, who their
associates should be. This is a medieval conception of the place of
women in society. They are given an inferior status and told by the
men how they should live their lives. Also such an attitude on the
part of white workers assumes that the main determinant in social
behavior should be, or is, sex and the relations between the sexes. A
white worker who exhibits such beliefs reveals that he accepts all
the anti-Negro propaganda that is spread through the country by the
purveyors of hate and working class disruption. This &#8220;social
equality&#8221; obsession of the white workers gives the impression that
his main concern in life is to keep Negro men away from &#8220;our
women.&#8221; All of this orients white labor away from what should be
their main concern: the united struggle of the working class black
and white, male and female, against the capitalist employers and
exploiters. Their attention gets centered on maintaining artificial
divisions within the working class, which strips labor of its
striking power, makes it the prey of every demagogue and hate-monger.</p>

<p>The most important aspect of this question of &#8220;social equality&#8221;
for the working class, however, is the fact that the white worker
thinks that he has social equality. He doesn&#8217;t know that the Negro
worker has just as much social equality in the fundamental sense as
the white worker. The essence of social equality is not merely nor
primarily the right or the opportunity to mingle socially with those
of other racial groups. The white worker does not achieve social
equality in capitalist society just because he excludes Negroes from
association with him. Social equality is the question of which class
one belongs to: ruling class or working class. In a capitalist
society if one belongs to the working class, then one does not and
cannot have or achieve social equality in that society. Only those
can be socially equal who share in the distribution of social power.
Social power, therefore, social equality is based on economic power.
Economic power means the owner ship of the means of producing wealth:
the mines, mills, factories and the banks.</p>

<p>The white worker deludes himself even if he believes that he has
political equality. Many workers think thus because they have one
vote the same as the millionaire. Rockefeller has only one vote the
same as the lowliest wage-earner. But political power too, can be
understood only by looking at capitalist society or capitalist
democracy (the United States) as a society divided by class lines:
ruling class on one side and the working class on the other. The
ruling class rules politically as a class because this class owns the
wealth and the means of producing wealth. It protects its political
power, it dominates the government and the country by virtue of the
fact that it has social power.</p>

<p>If the white worker, the white trade unionist, would look at this
question through his own eyes, that is, through his own experience he
would get the point clearly. He wants to bar the Negro worker from
his dance but this white worker doesn&#8217;t think the matter through.
This white worker is himself barred from his employer&#8217;s dance or
other social affairs of his employer. He is barred from his
employer&#8217;s club, from his home and from the whole social, economic
and political life of his employer. The two belong to two different
and antagonistic classes in capitalist society. The employer has
social equality. He can go wherever his desires or inclinations lead
him. He may marry in his own class or in the working class. He may
eat in the most expensive cafe or in the humblest and cheapest. He
may join the swankiest club or the cellar hangout of the very dregs
of society. For his social life he may stay in his class or leave his
class., The white worker cannot do these things. He is forced to
remain with his class. He has no economic power, no social power,
therefore he cannot have social equality in a capitalist society.</p>

<p>The natural ally therefore for the white worker, socially,
politically and industrially is the Negro worker. They are in the
same boat together: members of the same class. The work- ing class
cannot cross the class line; either in its social life, its economic
life or its political life. Both are propertyless wage-earners. There
is political, social and economic equality between them. The white
worker is socially equal to the Negro worker and <i>vice versa</i>.
This is one of the stark and crude facts of capitalist society. No
amount of nonsense about superior and inferior races; no catch
questions about the marriage of one&#8217;s sister to a Negro worker can
destroy the fact that this Negro worker, as a worker, is socially,
politically and economically equal to the white worker; to his
sister, his wife or his mother. It is capitalist society with its
class lines and its exploitation which makes this so. It is the fact
that both are wage-earners which establishes this basic fact.</p>

<p>The new program urgently needed for the labor movement must take
this fact into account. The white working class must place in its
program and in all workers&#8217; organizations: Social, Political and
Economic Equality for the Negro.</p>
