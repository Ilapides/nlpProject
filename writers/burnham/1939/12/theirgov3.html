<p class="fst">Anthropologists have carried out many interesting studies of a
widespread historical phenomenon which they sometimes call &ldquo;cultural
lag.&rdquo; A cultural lag occurs, to take a simple instance, when a
set of ideas, relevant to a particular social context, persist as
beliefs in the minds and words of men when that context has
disappeared. In the new context, the ideas are a carry-over from an
earlier cultural situation.</p>

<p>No group in society is altogether exempt from such cultural lags.
As I read, last week, the reports of the proceedings of the annual
&ldquo;Congress of American Industry,&rdquo; sponsored by the
National Association of Manufacturers, I regretted that no
anthropologist has as yet taken as his subject for examination this
authoritative group of American businessmen, to place in his textbook
alongside the examples he gives from the life of primitive tribes.</p>

<p>These men, so &ldquo;practical,&rdquo; ruthless and flexible in
their business conduct, are in a true sense of the word primitive in
their entire ideology. Their system of general ideas continues to be
merely a re-hash of the concepts of the &ldquo;classical economics&rdquo;
of a century ago, referring to the early stages of industrial
capitalism, without the slightest significant relation to
contemporary society. Not a single one of them is capable of giving
any scientific or philosophic illumination to the problems of today,
not even to their own problems. Their ideas are as outmoded as would
be a chemist&rsquo;s who talked about &ldquo;phlogiston&rdquo; or an
electro-physicist who argued about an &ldquo;electrical fluid.&rdquo;
Their ideal is, in their own words, that of &ldquo;normal economic
processes, unhampered by artificial restraints&rdquo;: the ideal,
that is, of the immediate followers of Ricardo.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Wisdom of our Masters</h4>

<p class="fst">This year&rsquo;s Congress of American Industry adopted, with a
unanimous flourish, a grandiose <em>Platform of the Congress of
American Industry</em>, the Magna Charta, presumably, of the N.A.M.
Few recorded documents have ever been emptier.</p>

<p>There is no lack, of course, of self-confidence:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;It must be made clear to the public that
industry&rsquo;s enlightened self-interest is linked inextricably
with the welfare of all of these other elements and with the welfare
of the nation of the whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Nor any absence of tried and trusted phrases:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Industrial management must continue to do all in
its power to keep alive the faith of the public in the traditional
American principles of free enterprise, as the guarantor of
individual opportunity and security.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">But, incredible as it might seem, the entire platform does not
mention in a single word or phrase either unemployment or the war!
Nor, indeed, is there any concrete analysis of anything.</p>

<p>Yet, from another point of view, this <em>Platform</em> is not
without a purpose, and this purpose at the same time explains why it
cannot be other than stupid.</p>

<p>Eight requisites for achieving the &ldquo;goal&rdquo; of industry
are listed. The <em>first two</em> of the requisites are as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;1. Maintenance of individual initiative and free
enterprise ...</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;2. Recognition of the social value of the profit
motive as a powerful incentive to all productive effort and of the
economic need for profits in industry sufficient to maintain and
expand existing enterprise.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">These are the polite words in which businessmen refer to
capitalism. Placing these two requisites as first in achieving their
goal means simply: for us, capitalist private property rights come
first, and everything else is subordinated to them, everything else
will be sacrificed to them.</p>

<p>With this as their central purpose, they could not possibly go on
to any scientific analysis of the economy. If they did, they would
only be able to prove that unemployment, starvation, misery, war,
national and international chaos are what follow from their purpose;
they would have to expose themselves to the public, and &ndash; what
is painful for many of them &ndash; also to themselves. Therefore,
they can only fall back on vague generalities and the slogans of Adam
Smith.</p>

<p>The cultural lag in the ideas of these men symbolizes accurately
the fact that the men themselves and the purposes which they try to
fulfill in the world have come into insurmountable conflict with any
sane and decent plan for the re-organization of society in the
interests of mankind as a whole.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The N.A.M. and Washington</h4>

<p class="fst">There is another notable feature of the <em>Platform</em> and, for
the most part, of the speeches at the Congress. As compared with
former years, the tone is extremely mild. From 1935 until last year
there were always a number of bitter attacks on the Roosevelt
administration and its policies. This year, the administration was
hardly mentioned, and objections to its policies took the form
usually of friendly advice rather than sharp criticism.</p>

<p>There seem to be two chief reasons for this important change. In
the first place, these men, so stupid in general ideas but shrewd in
practical affairs, know that the New Deal is buried. They do not,
like Dubinsky or Hillman or the <strong>New Leader</strong>, bury their heads
in a dream of the past, when it comes to a problem of dollars and
cents. They are well satisfied with the Roosevelt reaction of the
last year, so far as it has gone to date. Naturally they still have
their demands: one of the planks in their platform is their way of
calling for abolition of the closed shop. But the bogeyman of
Roosevelt as a &ldquo;serious threat to business,&rdquo; which
haunted some of them, is by now dispelled.</p>

<p>And, secondly, they are, in their own way, worried about the war.
Their fears were expressed by Ernest T. Weir, who has spoken
similarly on several occasions during recent months. Dimly they grasp
their terrible dilemma: that they, the rulers of America, cannot live
without plunging the nation into the war; and yet that they may not
find themselves and their system still living when the war is over.
They do not know how to solve this dilemma, which is in fact
insoluble. And many of them are beginning to believe that they will
have to turn the war-job over to Roosevelt, who seems so confident
that he can handle it.</p>
