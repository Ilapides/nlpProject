<h4>The Relief Crisis</h4>

<p class="fst">The relief crisis in Cleveland, rapidly coming to a head also in
other Ohio cities, serves to remind us in a very grim and dramatic
manner that the war is not an isolated symptom of the frightful decay
of capitalist civilization, and that the United States is in no way
immune from the international spread of that decay. 16,000 persons,
with no resources and no chance for any job, public or private, have
been cut entirely off home relief. They and many tens of thousands
more are subsisting on a diet, provided by the Federal Surplus
Commodities Corporation which is demonstrably unable to maintain a
minimum health level, in many cases not even life itself.</p>

<p>The Mayor of Cleveland, the Governor of Ohio and the Federal
government are engaged in a vigorous game of three-cornered
buck-passing, each trying to get rid of the responsibility. It can
hardly make much difference to the unemployed under whose auspices
they are condemned to starve and freeze.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter, of course, is that during the past year,
at the bidding of big business, a <em>combined</em> drive against the
unemployed has been pushed steadily forward by federal, State and
local governments, Republican and Democratic parties alike.</p>

<p>At the head of this drive stands Franklin Roosevelt, who, a little
more than a year ago, began the rapid transformation of the New Deal
into the War Deal.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Plans for the Next Congress</h4>

<p class="fst">There is nothing to be astonished at in the Cleveland crisis. It
is just one more blow in a long and linked series which is by no
means ended. It ties up plainly with the way in which, last November
and December, Roosevelt dropped 300,000 from the WPA rolls, and, in
March of this year, threw 50,000 foreign-born residents into the
streets. It is bound closely to this year&rsquo;s WPA appropriation
figure, which, at Roosevelt&rsquo;s demand, is a billion dollars less
than last year. It is related directly to Roosevelt&rsquo;s slashing
of WPA rolls by 1,700,000 between November 1, 1938 and September 1,
1939 (they have risen only slightly from the low point of 1,600,000
which they reached in September). It is comparable, plainly, to the
dropping of all WPA workers who had been on the rolls more than
eighteen months, to the elimination of the theater projects and most
of the arts and cultural projects, to the smashing of the wage scales
on the building projects.</p>

<p>And, when anyone actively resists the process, we know already
what happens: the current Minneapolis trials, prepared by the F.B.I.
and directed by Roosevelt&rsquo;s favorite, Frank Murphy, are samples
of the answers that the administration gives to its serious critics.
According to Murphy and the Minneapolis judge, unwillingness on the
part of the unemployed to starve and freeze constitutes: conspiracy.</p>

<p>Let no one imagine that what is happening in Ohio will suggest to
Roosevelt that he has perhaps gone &ldquo;too far&rdquo; and that
more adequate appropriations for the unemployed should be restricted.
He hasn&rsquo;t started yet. The present plan of the administration
is to recommend to the next session of Congress a total WPA
appropriation of one billion dollars &ndash; a further cut, from the
figure of this year&rsquo;s budget, of approximately half a billion
dollars.</p>

<p>The size of the WPA and other public works appropriations is
necessarily related to the home relief conditions in the cities,
since less public works money means more home relief needed; and the
bankers who control the city and State finances are not prepared to
meet the additional financial strains.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Relief, WPA and the War</h4>

<p class="fst">The cartoonists of the boss press are fond of showing us that the
slogan of Goering and the other Nazis is &lsquo;Guns, not butter&rdquo;.
That is what Nazism means, they tell us: you get armaments and war
instead of food. They say this today in order to ask us to fight in
their war tomorrow.</p>

<p>But the cartoonists, like Roosevelt, seem to be suffering from
severe cases of far-sightedness. They can distinguish events much
more clearly at 4,000 miles than in their own front yards.</p>

<p>And their far-sightedness seems to affect not merely their eyes
but their feelings. Their horror, sympathy and indignation are most
easily and immensely aroused at the plight of Marshal Mannerheim &ndash;
murderer of tens of thousands of Finnish workers and peasants &ndash;
and the plight of Polish colonels and landlords &ndash; inventors of
modern pogroms (not to mention Chinese cities bombed by planes and
ammunition constructed in their factories), but they have only G-men
and cops for the conspirators in Minneapolis and Cleveland who want,
of all things, a little food, and medicine for their children.</p>

<p>And while quietly preparing the new WPA bill with the half-billion
cut, the administration announces &ndash; not so quietly &ndash; that
at the least half a billion will have to be added to the armament
appropriations. Somehow, when you stop to think about it, it&rsquo;s
not so easy to see just exactly where this whole policy differs from
the Goering guns-not-butter principle.</p>

<p>Doubtless we should sympathize with Roosevelt: with all the mighty
events in Europe and Asia to keep him busy, he probably has no time
left to worry about a dozen million unemployed and their families at
home. But the unemployed themselves, not having jobs to waste their
energies on, can profitably devote some time to the question of how
they are going to continue living.</p>

<p>In reply to Roosevelt&rsquo;s weekly declarations to the world
about democracy and humanity, the unemployed might well issue
statements of their own on such subjects as &ldquo;A job and a decent
living for every worker&rdquo;, &ldquo;All war funds to the
unemployed&rdquo;, &ldquo;A thirty dollar weekly minimum income for
every worker, employed or unemployed&rdquo;, &ldquo;Expropriate the
Sixty Families, and use the money for a gigantic scheme of public
works&rdquo; ... And if the statements did not receive the notice
that Roosevelt is granted in the press, militant action under the
banner of such statements will be sure to do so.</p>

<p>Nor will such action by the unemployed be separated from the
struggle against the war itself. The fight against the war is the
fight against the war-makers and their whole rotten system. The War
Deal plans to reduce the unemployed to an outlaw, coolie caste.
Successful resistance to these plans by the unemployed will be their
heaviest blow at the war.</p>
