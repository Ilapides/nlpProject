<p class="fst">The CIO&rsquo;s <em>Legislative Program for 1940</em>, which was
made public this week, deserves careful study. However inadequate we
may think it, however much we may disagree with part or all of it,
its contrast to the <em>Platform of American Industry</em> (the
manifesto of the National Association of Manufacturers that I
discussed last week) is immediately apparent and in all respects
favorable to the CIO. The CIO document <em>says something</em>, and
what it says is relevant to the concrete realities of present-day
life. The N.A.M. said nothing; its platform is a meaningless jumble
of abstract rhetoric. There is little doubt that the CIO deliberately
intends to have its program appear in the public eye as the direct
challenger of that of the bosses.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The C.I.O. States the Problems</h4>

<p class="fst">John L. Lewis has many times proved himself a sensitive reflector
of the moods of the workers in this country. This, indeed, is the
source of his great strength and superiority as a labor leader. (That
he ruthlessly exploits and perverts these moods for reactionary ends
is another matter.) He is the shrewdest of opportunists, riding on
the crest of proletarian mass sentiment. It was in this way that he
took triumphant leadership of the industrial union movement, leaving
behind in his wake the case-hardened old fogies.</p>

<p>The new CIO Legislative Program gives witness once again to Lewis&rsquo;
sensitivity. In clear and open fashion, the <em>Program</em> states,
and states correctly, the really major problems facing the American
working class. Every worker will find himself in agreement on <em>the
statement of problems</em>. There is no twaddle about &ldquo;Hull&rsquo;s
trade treaties&rdquo; or &ldquo;balanced budgets&rdquo; or &ldquo;municipal
corruption,&rdquo; with which the boss press is now filled in an
effort to confuse the people, but: <em>the war, jobs, and democratic
rights.</em></p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The Congress of Industrial Organizations urges for
the serious consideration by the Federal Congress a legislative
program based upon certain fundamental objectives; (1) The United
States must keep out of involvement in the foreign wars; (2) The
attention of this country and the energies of our Government,
industrial and labor leaders of this country, must be directed toward
the immediate solving of the problem of unemployment; (3) The
democratic rights and institutions of this country must be preserved
and maintained; and (4) There must be continued assurance and
protection of the rights of labor to organize and bargain
collectively as the cornerstone for the preservation and extension of
any economic and social program.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">These points are elaborated in the body of the program. In
addition there are sections on the Wagner Act, the Fair Labor
Standards Act, Social Security, Health, Housing and Taxation. So far
as they go, no exception can be taken to what is advocated in these
sections. The demands, it is true, do not in any case go far enough
if we judge them in terms of the needs of the masses, but their
direction is undoubtedly right. As a matter of fact, they are more
adequate and enlightened than I remember in any comparable CIO or AFL
document in recent years.</p>

<p>In passing, it is worth observing that the old CIO policy of
calling for &ldquo;no amendment&rdquo; to the Wagner Act, as the
means of fighting against reactionary attempts at amendment, has been
changed to a counterattack. The CIO now demands amendments of its own
directed toward strengthening the Act in labor&rsquo;s interests by
providing criminal penalties for employers&rsquo; offenses against
the Act, prohibition of government contracts to firms violating the
Act, and prohibition of the splitting up of industrial unions.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What Is Left Out</h4>

<p class="fst">From what I have said so far, it might seem that I ought to urge
support and acceptance of the <em>Program</em> as a suitable platform
for the Socialist Workers Party. Indeed, I do believe that most of
its specific proposals ought to be supported by the S.W.P. and by all
workers.</p>

<p>But a <em>Program</em> has a history; and must be judged by what it
omits as well as by what it says. If we examine this <em>CIO Program</em>
from a more extended point of view, we must add new conclusions.</p>

<p>The <em>Program</em>, for example, says nothing about whom labor
must fight against in order to achieve its objectives; nor how to
carry on the fight for them; nor also most important &ndash; what the
record of Lewis has been in the past fights for similar objectives.</p>

<p>The <em>Program</em> advocates a minimum of 3.000,000 jobs in public
works plus public jobs for all youth who are out of work and out of
school. In the past also Lewis has been for jobs; but he persuaded
the workers to fight for them by putting all faith in Roosevelt, who
was the man who cut the jobs.</p>

<p>The <em>Program</em> advocates keeping out of war. In the past, too,
Lewis has spoken against getting into the war; but he has been and
remains a part of the Roosevelt machine which is itself the chief
war-making apparatus.</p>

<p>The <em>Program</em> demands democratic rights for labor. But in the
past Lewis has got the workers to support the candidates of the
Republican and Democratic parties, who, once in office, are the ones
who smash those rights.</p>

<p>The <em>Program</em> advocates decent housing, medical service,
social security. But it says not one word against the rotted system
of private property and private profits which, so long as it
continues, guarantees that the workers will never have decent housing
or medical service or social security.</p>

<p>This is the record, and this is why the <em>Program</em>, from the
point of view of Lewis and his fellow-bureaucrats, is a fake,
designed not to organize the workers for a real struggle toward the
objectives of peace, jobs and freedom, but to head off such a
struggle and to keep them tied to things as they are.</p>

<p>This does not mean that the <em>Program</em> should be just
forgotten (as Lewis will forget it when the time for voting comes).
It means that if its progressive aims are to be realized, the
workers, and especially the CIO members, should take the struggle for
those aims out of the hands of Lewis, and fight in closed, militant
and independent class ranks.</p>
