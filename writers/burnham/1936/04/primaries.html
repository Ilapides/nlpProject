<p class="fst">In the recent New York State Primaries, both in New York City and
 upstate, the Militant Socialists won a substantial and decisive
 majority over the Old Guard. This result is particularly important in
 its prophecy of an equally progressive outcome to next month&rsquo;s
 national convention of the Socialist Party. Prom every
 forward-looking point of view, this repudiation of the Old Guard
 represents a genuine step in advance not merely for the Socialist
 Party itself, but for the developing labor movement in this country
 as a whole.</P>
<P>The extent of the victory of the Militants exceeded most
 predictions, even those of the Militants themselves. It is important
 and necessary to understand what accounts for the result.</P>
<P>Basically &ndash; as we have on numerous occasions pointed out &ndash;
 the factional struggle within the Socialist Party reflects new
 processes of ferment and differentiation which have been taking place
 within the advanced sections of the working class as a result of the
 Spanish, German, and Austrian events, the intensification of the war
 crisis, and the character of the post-1929 economic crisis. The
 ferment and differentiation are not, of course, confined to this
 country, but are reproduced in an analogous manner on an
 international scale. The central lesson drawn from the world events,
 with varying degrees of clarity, by increasing sections of workers
 within the orbit of the Second International has been: traditional
 social-democratic reformism is bankrupt, and serves only to lead the
 working class to disaster, and to sacrifice the working class to
 finance-capital in every crisis &ndash; to fascism as readily as to
 imperialist war.</P>
<P>This is, it will be observed, the negative half of the lesson
 which must be drawn if the full positive potentialities of these
 developments are to be achieved. It is necessary not merely to
 understand that social-democratic reformism is bankrupt ; but,
 positively, to break sharply from Social-democracy; and this sharp
 break can be decisively accomplished only by embracing and adhering
 firmly to the principles of revolutionary Marxism. Half-way measures
 and ambiguities can provide a partial and temporary solution, can
 make possible even certain victories on the road; but anything less
 than the full conclusion will in the end cut short the progressive
 development, will route the advancing workers back to reformism,
 aside into the death-house of Stalinism, or down into futile
 isolation.</P>
<P>At each stage of the development, the basic underlying process
 appears only to a limited and to some degree distorted extent on the
 surface. The political differentiation takes on in the struggle an
 organizational form; and for a while it is the organizational contest
 which appears as paramount over the political issues &ndash; though
 it is the latter which in the long run determine the organizational
 expressions. The opposing slogans hide as often as they reveal the
 basic questions. Nevertheless, the process and the movement continue,
 and gradually re-shape the slogans.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Two Decisive Factors</H4>
<p class="fst">The New York Primaries fight, itself a stage in the larger
 struggle, is highly instructive as an aid to our understanding of the
 process as a whole, if we examine the specific and immediate factors
 which account for the sweeping victory of the Militants, the
 following two seem to have been decisive:</P>
<OL>
	<li>The Old Guard openly and consistently conducted its fight on
	the basis of conservative social-democratic reformism. Their
	campaign was a campaign of furious Red-baiting, in which the New
	Leader accused the Militants every week of being dyed-in-the-wool
	Communists, reds, Trotskyists, and revolutionists. But the majority
	of the dues-paying party members and the non-party enrolled
	Socialist voters have already absorbed the negative half of the
	lesson of the past three years; they have become convinced that
	hardened reformism is useless and worse than useless. Thus, this
	campaign of the Old Guard, though consistent and on the whole ably
	conducted, lost rather than gained support, recommended the
	Militants to the members rather than frightened the members away.
	The case of the Old Guard <I>against</I> the Militants was, in the
	eyes of the majority of the membership the best case that could be
	made <I>for</I> the Militants. In this sense, it might be said that
	the <B>New Leader</B> was the most effective agitational organ of
	the Militants; politically speaking, more effective than their own
	<B>Socialist Call</B>.<BR>&nbsp;</li>
</OL>
<H4>Ranks Activized</H4>
<OL START=2>
	<li>A different kind of factor played almost an equally important
	role in this Primary struggle. For the first time in years, under
	the leadership of the Militants in the past few months, the
	Socialist Party of New York State showed real signs of activity. The
	Militants sent organizers up-state, renewed branches, made speaking
	tours, sent out communications, increased their participation in
	strikes and demonstrations. They conducted debates with the
	Stalinists &ndash; and out-debated them. The party felt some new
	blood in its veins. The Old Guard had completely neglected the rank
	and file of the party. And. indeed, the Old Guard is not greatly
	interested in the rank and file. It rests on institutions like the
	Forward, on the trade union bureaucracy, on fat retainers from the
	unions for Old Guard lawyers, on appointments by LaGuardia. In many
	ways, a rank and file is an inconvenience to the Old Guard. The
	membership was undoubtedly strongly impressed by this difference
	between the Old Guard and the Militant leadership. They responded to
	the Militant appeal for &ldquo;an active, effective Socialist
	Party.&rdquo; They linked this slogan for &ldquo;a democratic,
	inclusive party,&rdquo; and saw that together they meant a resolve
	to bring the Socialist Party out of the backwater in which it had
	been sleeping for a decade into the broader stream of the mass
	movement. Many members doubtless cast their votes for the Militants
	on this basis rather than from the more complex theoretic
	consideration &ndash; though the two are not, of course, unrelated.</li>
</OL>
<p class="fst">The character of the struggle of the Old Guard is very strikingly
 shown by the issue of the <B>New Leader</B> (dated April 11) which
 followed the Primaries. Indeed, this issue sums up in brief the whole
 nature of the Old Guard. Significantly, we find a repeated insistence
 that their fight is a fight &ldquo;for principle&rdquo;; and repeated
 references to themselves as &ldquo;Social Democrats&rdquo; and to
 their principles as the principles of &ldquo;Social Democracy.&rdquo;
 Their fight, they make clear, is absolutely uncompromising and
 intransigent.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>&ldquo;Voice of Social Democracy&rdquo;</H4>
<p class="fst">&ldquo;The voice of Social Democracy,&rdquo; they threaten, &ldquo;will
 be heard in Cleveland&rdquo; (at the national convention). &ldquo;The
 Social Democrats in the party,&rdquo; they warn, &ldquo;know no
 surrender. They have just begun to fight.&rdquo; In an editorial
 headed <I>Our Eight for Principles</I> they herald the approaching
 end of the present struggle &ndash; &ldquo;The long struggle of the
 <B>New Leader</B> for fundamental principles and policies is drawing
 to a close ...&rdquo;</P>
<P>The feature article on the <B>New Leader</B>&rsquo;s Anniversary
 Banquet quotes from the speech of Louis Waldman:</P>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Ours was not a fight, as some tried to make people
 believe, for the continuance in power of our side of the Socialist
 Party but for the fundamental program of Social Democracy. From that
 program we shall not recede, no matter who is in control of the
 Socialist Party.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="fst">This issue of the <B>New Leader</B>, furthermore, makes entirely
 clear what the Old Guard understands the fundamental program of
 Social Democracy to be. No opportunity is overlooked to crack down on
 &ldquo;dictatorship&rdquo; and to uphold &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;:
 that is, to attack the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat, and
 to announce the adhesion of the Old Guard to the bourgeois-democratic
 state, whose agents in the working class the Old Guard prides itself
 on being, and aims to continue to be.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Bill Green Toasted</H4>
<p class="fst">The biggest display of the entire issue is given to the speech of
 William Green, the guest of honor at the Anniversary Banquet &ndash;
 Green, whose long record of thorough-going reaction and treachery in
 the trade union movement has been climaxed during the past year by
 his firm resistance to every progressive development, by his bitter
 fight against the industrial unionists, by his dictatorial brutality
 in connection with the automobile workers, the rubber workers, the
 teachers, and the radio workers, by his pitiful cringing before the
 government on every possible occasion. Vladeck, at the banquet, paid
 fulsome &ldquo;tribute to Mr. Green for his constructive leadership
 of the American labor movement and for his conduct as the champion of
 the oppressed.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The other featured trade-unionist among the speakers at the
 banquet was Matthew Woll, partner of Ralph Easley for years in the
 National Civic Federation, Hearst&rsquo;s chief red-baiting rival.
 Another leading article, proudly displayed in a box on the front
 page, is by Abraham Lefkowitz, co-leader of the Teachers&rsquo;
 Guild, splitter of the Teachers&rsquo; Union, and active dualist to
 the A.F. of L. The Old Guard, of course, is a great denunciator of
 &ldquo;dual unionism&rdquo; &ndash; except, naturally, when more
 &ldquo;basic&rdquo; issues are involved.</P>
<P>The strategic aim of the Old Guard is also given:</P>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Confident,&rdquo; said Waldman at the banquet, &ldquo;in
 the conviction that we represent on the political field the same
 program, the same principles, the same loyalty to labor exemplified
 in the British Labour Party, we are equally confident that with our
 allies of the labor movement the future belongs to our type of
 socialism.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="fst">Abe Cahan looked forward to &ldquo;the rapid development of
 fraternal relationship between the Socialist and labor movements in
 this country similar to that existing between the British Trades
 Union Congress and the Labor Party.&rdquo; The visit of Herbert
 Morrison of the British Labour Party to this country is hailed and
 advertised. And well might the Old Guard greet its British brothers:
 has not the British Labour Party set them grandiose examples in the
 technique of representing the interests of finance-capital within the
 working class? Was it not through the British L.P. that national
 unity was achieved in the last war? that the General Strike was
 broken? that the budget is balanced at the expense of the British
 workers? that British imperial policy is now being put across to the
 masses in the present war crisis?</P>
<P>Yes, the Old Guard knows where it stands. It stands for the tried
 and sure methods for bringing defeat and disaster to the working
 class; for the policies that assembled the workers for imperialism in
 1914; the policies that defeated the revolution in Germany; the
 policies that greased the ways for Hitler, that shed the despairing
 blood of the workers in Austria and Spain. These policies it
 inscribes on its banner, and displays proudly and openly to the
 world.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Safety-Valve Labor Party</H4>
<p class="fst">Nor is it to be imagined that these policies are defeated by the
 victory of the Militants in the Primaries, or by their probable
 victory at the national convention. The Old Guard looks ahead. It
 realizes that a broad rank and file is not vital to its plans. It
 sees the &ldquo;model of the British Labour Party&rdquo;. And it
 aims, together with the trade union bureaucrats, to head off the
 development of the revolutionary party in this country, during the
 years after 1936, by harnessing the leftward movement of the workers
 into a reformist Labor Party controlled by it and the bureaucrats,
 together no doubt with various of the &ldquo;progressives&rdquo; and
 liberals. And it is confident that this is the kind of Labor Party
 which could alone be built on a mass basis in this country. And it
 understands that, under present conditions, the Labor Party agitation
 can be utilized as by far the most effective weapon against the
 progress of revolutionary ideas among the masses and the
 strengthening of revolutionary organization.</P>
<P>The Old Guard, then, is fighting a principled and uncompromising
 tight. On the whole, it has been a well-fought fight. The occasional
 slanders and exaggerations are perhaps the inevitable concomitants of
 such political struggles. The trouble with their fight has been not
 the lack of principled character, but that their principles were
 wrong. And, in this case, not merely wrong from the point of view of
 the historical interests of the working class, but also out of line
 with the wishes and opinions of the majority of Socialist Party
 members and enrolled voters.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Lessons for the Militants</H4>
<p class="fst">But, in spite of the fact that the Militants won in the Primary
 contest, there are lessons for the Militants to learn from the
 general character of the fight which the Old Guard conducted. The
 campaign of the <B>Socialist Call</B> compares in many respects
 unfavorably with the campaign of the <B>New Leader</B>. During the
 months preceding the Primaries there was only one substantial article
 published in the <B>Call</B> making a principled political attack on
 the Old Guard. In the time intervening before the national
 convention, the <B>Call</B> has a chance to remedy this defect by
 setting itself the task of clarifying political issues, of stating
 and exposing before the party membership the precise political
 character of the Old Guard and its policies, of lifting the struggle
 determinedly from a merely personal and organizational plane. Only in
 this way will the factional struggle be in the fuller sense
 educational and invigorating, instead of petty and disintegrating,
 for the party as a whole. And only in this way will the Militants lay
 the firm basis for broader and deeper leftward developments in the
 days ahead.</P>
<P>For this reason, there is occasion to be concerned over references
 to possibilities of &ldquo;conciliation with the Old Guard&rsquo;&rsquo;
 which have been made since the Primaries. Naturally, individual
 workers who hold reformist positions are and should be eligible for
 Party membership, if &ndash; from whatever motive &ndash; they are
 prepared to work loyally within the framework of the Party. But here
 it is a question of the Old Guard as such. The Old Guard, it is true,
 makes clear that the only possible &ldquo;conciliation&rdquo; from
 its point of view would be triumph for itself and its ideas; and
 consequently there is little probability that any kind of actual
 organizational conciliation could be arrived at under any formula.
 But the real danger in talk of &ldquo;conciliation&rdquo; is not an
 organizational question.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Danger of Conciliation</H4>
<p class="fst">The real danger is that behind such talk there can readily creep a
 tendency to conciliate with Old Guard ideas and policies, a tendency
 to retreat from the leftward front so far won, and march back along
 the road of disaster. What has been won can be held only by boldness,
 not by timidity; social forces are in continual motion, and positions
 can be maintained only by further advance and attack, never by
 resting in the trenches. The Old Guard has suffered a severe setback
 organizationally; now is exactly the time to follow the blow up with
 others still stronger, and to add to the organizational the more
 powerful and more lasting political weapons.</P>
