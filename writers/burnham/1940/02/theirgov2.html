<p class="fst">It is a key principle of realistic political analysis that the
foreign and domestic policies of governments are inseparably linked,
that they are, in fact, for the most part simply two phases of the
same policy. It could hardly be otherwise. The basic problem for each
government is to run the state institutions, which it administers, in
the interests of the ruling class of the given nation; to uphold
against all enemies the social structure upon which the power of the
ruling class rests. This problem confronts the government equally on
the domestic and the international arena. Foreign policy (including
war) is the attempt to solve this problem as it is posed externally,
just as domestic policy is the attempt to solve the same problem
internally.</p>

<p>Most liberals and reformists try to obscure the link between
foreign and domestic policy. Up until recently some of them used to
tell us that they &ldquo;approved Roosevelt&rsquo;s New Deal&rdquo;
(his domestic policy) but disagreed with his &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo;
foreign policy. Now many of them are reversing. They say that they
object to his internal measures (cutting down of relief, drive
against civil rights, prosecution of labor unions ...) but are in
accord with his &ldquo;peace&rdquo; and &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo;
program in external affairs.</p>

<p>Social-patriotic support of wars is often founded upon a pretended
separation between foreign and domestic policy. During peace, the
social-patriot criticizes the government, even calls for ousting it
and putting a labor government in its place. Internally, they admit,
the government (Daladier&rsquo;s, for example!) run by bourgeois
parties acts for the bankers and the industrialists, and against the
masses of the people. But beyond the borders the government changes
its spots: there it acts as the representative of &ldquo;the entire
nation.&rdquo; Consequently (as in France and England today) the
social-patriotic parties vote unanimously for the government when it
comes to prosecuting a war.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>New Deal and War Deal</h4>

<p class="fst">The general rule that foreign and domestic policies are linked
applies, of course, to the Roosevelt government. Roosevelt was not a
Dr. Jekyll when proposing New Deal laws to Congress and a Mr. Hyde
when sending a note to Japan or intervening in Mexico. In both types
of action, he proceeded from the same premise in the effort to solve
the same problem.</p>

<p>The transition from New Deal to War Deal, which began in October
1937, swung into high a year ago, and will be completed with the
entry of the country directly into the war, can be understood as a
shift in emphasis. During the New Deal the emphasis, the weighting,
was on internal measures as the primary mechanism for solving the
problems of American capitalism; the War Deal means the realization
that the internal measures have failed, and the consequent shifting
of relative emphasis to external measures.</p>

<p>The shift is symbolized by the difference in the way that
Roosevelt is looked upon by most people. Until a year ago he appeared
primarily as a national reformer on the home front. More and more he
now figures as the bearer of the country&rsquo;s destiny on the
international scene.</p>

<p>However, the linkage between domestic and foreign affairs does not
stop merely because of the shift of emphasis. Major stress on
external measures came about as a result of the breakdown of
preceding internal measures; similarly the current external measures
react upon the internal situation.</p>

<p>This is true for American society as a whole, and in relation to
the government&rsquo;s basic problem of upholding capitalist rule. It
is true also for Roosevelt&rsquo;s narrower problem as head of the
governmental bureaucracy, as party politician and as an individual.</p>

<p>The enormous, swollen bureaucracy (Federal, State and local), the
Democratic party and Roosevelt as a person have very important
special interests of their own, in addition to and sometimes in
conflict with the interests of the ruling class which they serve.
Roosevelt knows that, just as formerly these special interests
depended chiefly on the showing made internally, so now they depend
first of all on the showing made externally. Roosevelt knows that his
own political fate, and the fate of his wing of the Democratic party,
and the jobs in the bureaucratic apparatus, are being decided by
&ldquo;foreign affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I believe that this background must be kept in mind if we are to
evaluate correctly many of the recent moves which Roosevelt has been
making in foreign affairs &ndash; including his flirtations with the
Vatican, the particular manner in which he has been handling the
Soviet-Finnish war, and the junket of Sumner Welles.</p>

<p>If the war had not started, Roosevelt would, I think, have been
washed up by now. He took an almost unalloyed beating from the
regular Congress last year, and from the opposition wing of his own
party. But the war put him back on his feet. His rating in the Gallup
Poll made an unprecedented jump in September and October.</p>

<p>At first his advisers apparently thought that the United States
would declare war within six or eight months, and that he and his
followers would ride back into office as the only adequate war
leaders. With the war developing as no one expected, they have become
puzzled. Will they campaign, in the party convention and the
election, on a &ldquo;he kept us out of war&rdquo; platform or with a
&ldquo;unite to win the war&rdquo; slogan? They can keep both roads
open provided (1) the war increases in seriousness and extent and (2)
Roosevelt is made to seem the only man who can handle the war crisis,
whether or not this country is formally a belligerent.</p>

<p>The first condition will take care of itself, without any pushing
from Roosevelt. The fulfillment of the second is a congenial task for
so accomplished a demagogue as Roosevelt. He and his publicity staff
constantly reinforce the impression that he is indispensable; his war
moves and his &ldquo;peace moves&rdquo; are alike presented with that
twist.</p>

<p>Some of these moves, like the armament appropriations, the
pressure on Japan, the drive in Latin America, the munitions sales
to France and Britain, are altogether serious parts of the general
war preparations and would be undertaken by any administration,
Democratic or Republican. In the case of others (the overtures to the
Vatican, the trip of Welles, and even the policy on Finland), we
observe a great gap between the grandiose words and the insignificant
actions. (With all the talk, Finland has got next to nothing that it
needs from this country, and probably is never going to get much.) It
is reasonable to suppose that in these latter moves, at least one of
Roosevelt&rsquo;s eyes and maybe half of the other is on next
summer&rsquo;s Chicago convention and November&rsquo;s election day
to follow.</p>
