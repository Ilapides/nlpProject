<p class="fst">Election Day next November will be pointed to with pride by
defenders of the &ldquo;American system&rsquo;&rsquo; as convincing
proof that &ldquo;genuine democracy&rdquo; prevails in this country.
On that day, they will argue, the adult population, of its own free
will, without coercion and by secret ballot, selects its own chief
executive, together with the other major officials who govern the
nation. In the case of the Presidency, all citizens over 21 years of
age may vote for anyone he wishes who is native-born and more than 35
years old. What further evidence could be required to show that the
people rule themselves, that they have the kind of government which
the majority wants to have?</p>

<p>Universal suffrage and the secret ballot are, in truth, precious
rights, and no Marxist will advocate abandoning them; on the
contrary, the problem in this country is rather to extend them so
that they will apply in fact to all, and not be restricted as at
present through various kinds of racial and property
disqualifications. Nevertheless, a very little examination of what
happens on and before Election Day will be enough to show that
universal suffrage and the secret ballot are in themselves powerless
to guarantee a full and genuine democracy.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>How Do Names Get on the Ballot?</h4>

<p class="fst">The Presidency is the decisive political office in the United
States today. The extension of the power of the executive branch of
the government during the past two or three decades gives it in
practice the controlling power over the most important political and
social issues, including power to involve the country in war.</p>

<p>On Election Day, though theoretically free to vote for anyone we
wish, the ballot actually prints the names of electors for only from
two to five or six candidates for the Presidency. In many if not most
States, only two candidates &ndash; those of the Republican and
Democratic parties &ndash; appear on the ballot.</p>

<p>How did those names get there? If the people have no real say
about what names they select from on the November ballot, or what
policies the men named stand for, then the pretended freedom of
choice in November is largely an illusion. It would be like telling
someone he is free to select any card he may wish from a deck, but
then constructing the deck so that it contained only two&rsquo;s and
three&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The decision about the two principal names to appear on the
November ballot will be made at the national conventions of the
Republican and Democratic parties, to be held in June and July.
Preparations for these conventions are now going rapidly forward.
Beginning next month, a series of primary elections will be held in
many States to select the convention delegates.</p>

<p>It might seem that through these primary elections, the people
should be able to control the work of the conventions, and thus
decide whose names go on the convention ballots. This is not at all
the case. The delegate slates at the primary elections are publicized
as if they were men pledged to Roosevelt, Garner, Dewey, Taft, or
whoever it might be; but, with the exception of only one or two
States, the pledges are not binding. The delegates are in no way
responsible to the people who voted for them; they may do anything
they please at the conventions. They are almost always hardened
machine-men, ready to do whatever they are told. The public pledge to
one candidate or another is only a temporary device to attract votes
and interest.</p>

<p>So much so is this the case that many of the chief candidates do
not even bother to enter slates in the primary elections. Senator
Taft, for example, high on the list of Republican possibilities, is
steering clear of public primary battles. He is lining up delegates
quietly, behind the scenes in the club-houses and committee-rooms.</p>

<p>Some years ago, many liberal reformers thought that direct
primaries for convention delegates would break the backs of the
corrupt political machines. A majority of States introduced them.
Experience showed that they were seldom a handicap, and often an
additional advantage, to the machines. In recent years, several
States have abandoned direct primaries, and gone back to the standard
method of selection by the State party committees.</p>

<p>Indirectly, of course, popular feeling influences to some extent
the selection of candidates. A convention, unless it wants to out its
own party throat, has got to pick a man with a certain amount of mass
appeal, who can be put across to the voters. But it remains a fact
that in the United States today there is no serious and responsible
democratic control over the major political parties and, through
them, over the personnel and policies of the government.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A Labor Party and Democracy</h4>

<p class="fst">There is no mystery in this fact when once we understand that the
existing parliamentary and party machinery in this country has as its
object not merely or even primarily to express a certain (very minor)
degree of democracy, but to <em>limit</em> and restrict democracy
within narrow and closely guarded borders. These borders are defined
by the property relations of capitalist economy and the interests of
the owners of property.</p>

<p>Inside those borders, some democracy is permissible, at least
until capitalism in order to save itself is compelled to resort to
fascist totalitarian politics. Outside those borders, attempts at
democracy become &ndash; &ldquo;subversive agitation.&rdquo; The
parliamentary machinery, the &ldquo;two-party system,&rdquo; are
designed to defend those borders, and thus to <em>limit</em> democratic
control by the masses in such a way that it cannot interfere with
capitalism.</p>

<p>These general considerations indicate one reason why it is so vain
to hope that the workers can ever &ldquo;use&rdquo; either the
Democratic or Republic parties to achieve their aims: by their very
nature these parties are anti-working class, and workers support them
only at the cost of making their own aims impossible.</p>

<p>For the workers to get anywhere on the political arena, the first
step has got to be to break out of the framework of capitalist &ndash;
that is, anti-working class &ndash; politics; specifically, in this
country, to break away from both the Democratic and Republican
parties, and build a workers&rsquo; party with a workers&rsquo;
program and workers&rsquo; candidates. If this isn&rsquo;t done, the
choice in November isn&rsquo;t worth the time it takes to walk to the
polls. A vote over who is to be warden is not very crucial when the
real problem is how to get out of jail.</p>
