<p class="fst">What, exactly, led John L. Lewis to open up against Roosevelt and
the Democratic Party at the recent convention of the United Mine
Workers? Where does it suggest that he is leading?</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Lewis is a sensitive reflector of mass
opinion. He has proved this by his whole career, outstandingly by the
organization of the CIO itself. He now feels a groundswell of
discontent, or resentment against Roosevelt, beginning to grow among
the workers. It is undoubtedly there, though not yet explicit enough
to be noticed by the Gallup polls.</p>

<p>Roosevelt is becoming too open and too crude in his drive toward
reaction. During the last year, he has had to appear more and more
into the open: his budgets propose the slashing of relief; he gives
the quotation to help break the WPA strike; his department of Justice
smashes down on civil rights; he becomes brazenly the head
war-monger.</p>

<p>Lewis&rsquo; speeches at the convention articulated the resentment
felt at this lengthening series of actions. He went &ndash; in words
&ndash; farther than the workers themselves have yet gone &ndash; in
words, and thereby holds on to his position of leadership, at the
front of the rising wave.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>CIO and the Administration</h4>

<p class="fst">But there was additional motivation as well. Until a year and a
half or so ago, it was undoubtedly the case that the administration
favored the CIO as against the AFL. This was shown by many decisions
of the Labor Board, by the designation of bargaining units, etc.; and
was marked for Lewis himself by his easy personal entry to the White
House. He was made to feel very much at home around the Presidential
fireside.</p>

<p>It would hardly be correct to say that the pendulum has swung
today all the distance to the AFL side, but this has certainly been
the trend. Last Spring the private Washington letters had already
begun to note that Congress and the White House were paying more
serious attention to the AFL leaders than to the CIO.</p>

<p>The Labor Board, with Leiserson replacing Smith, has been handing
down frequent decisions with an AFL slant. It is rumored that, in the
talks dealing with war plans in their relation to labor, Lewis is not
being given much consideration. At the same time, Lewis has more
difficulty arranging conversations with the smiling chief of the
White House.</p>

<p>Here, then, was a second group of reasons calling for public
action by Lewis.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What Is Lewis After?</h4>

<p class="fst">Lewis seemed to be burning a good many bridges by his remarks. But
a careful study of what he said, and left unsaid, shows that there
were not so many teeth behind the barks.</p>

<p>For a labor bureaucrat to express the resentment of the workers
does not at all mean that he will act to implement this resentment.
Indeed, history shows that most often the expression serves to quiet
down and divert the resentment: if it were allowed to remain bottled
up, it might explode in ways most awkward for the bureaucrat. There
is no good reason to imagine that Lewis intended to do much more than
carry out this time-worn function of the labor bureaucracy.</p>

<p>In order to keep his hold on the workers, he has got to show more
than he has been able to during the past year. Unquestionably his
speeches were meant as bargaining threats directed to the leaders of
both the Republican and Democratic parties, He is trying to remind
them that if they want to get labor votes, they will at the very
least have to give more lip-service to labor.</p>

<p>I do not, however, think that he himself took even his predictions
of &ldquo;inglorious defeat&rdquo; for Roosevelt, if Roosevelt tries
a third term, as literally as the words would seem to say. If
Roosevelt runs again &ndash; and it seems to me the most probable
variant &ndash; I think Lewis will still want to go along. Roosevelt
is clever enough to give him a formula which will help him in
re-writing his convention predictions.</p>

<p>There has been much gossip in Washington of Lewis&rsquo; dickering
with members of the Republican National Committee. Many of the
younger men in the administration are convinced that Lewis wants to
swing the CIO into the Republican column next November &ndash; the
Republican Party, until a few years ago, has been Lewis&rsquo;
traditional allegiance.</p>

<p>In the face of the attitude of most of the other union heads, this
would seem to be a move almost too dangerous even for Lewis. It is
noteworthy that his remarks at the convention were almost all in the
mode of a critical, &ldquo;left&rdquo; supporter of the Democrats. He
was calling on the Democratic Party to &ldquo;be sensible&rdquo;
about labor.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What of a Labor Party?</h4>

<p class="fst">There is not the slightest indication in Lewis&rsquo; actions that
he is moving toward a labor party for this year. Here also, his words
were, if anything, designed to head off, not to further, incipient
labor party sentiment. Lewis remains convinced that a labor party is
&ldquo;unrealistic politics&rdquo; in this country, with its
two-party parliamentary structure.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Lewis was compelled to say more than he doubtless
wanted to. The only possible logical conclusion from his attack was,
in actuality, a clean break with both of the boss parties and the
building of a labor party. Though he refused to state the conclusion,
Lewis really proved that labor cannot make use of the boss parties
and must have a party of its own. There must have been many delegates
at the convention, and many workers throughout the country, who drew
this conclusion for themselves in spite of their not hearing it from
the platform.</p>

<p>A first step to put this conclusion into practise will have to be
the realization that a fight for an independent labor party now is a
fight against Lewis. We must not allow Lewis&rsquo; bold words to
deceive us into thinking that he intends to follow them with bold
actions next summer and autumn. If Lewis goes into a labor party, it
will be because he sees as the alternative getting out of the labor
movement altogether. It would be a fine thing if that choice could be
put before him.</p>
