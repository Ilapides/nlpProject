<p class="fst">National politics, in its narrower aspects, continues to be
dominated by &ldquo;the third term issue&rdquo;, Roosevelt, as
always, plays his cards shrewdly &ndash; close to his chest, as the
gamblers say. By his careful silence, broken only by the smiling
wisecracks, he has kept in domination of the whole field, in both
parties. The entire struggle for the Presidency centers around him;
every eager candidate is measured first and last against him, not
against his fellow-hopefuls.</p>

<p>The best-informed opinion runs at present about as follows: Within
the next month or two Roosevelt will issue a statement on his
candidacy. In this he will give a Rooseveltian version of Coolidge&rsquo;s
famous 1928 &ldquo;I do not choose to run&rdquo;. Meanwhile, he will
continue leaning toward Secretary of State Hull, following up the
boost he gave in the annual message to Congress. Hull (who, in spite
of his white hair and his innocent honest expression is well known as
a hardened and skillful machine man) is acceptable to the right wing
of the Democratic party, and looks right now like the ideal
compromise between the New Deal and the Garner factions. Garner,
according to this perspective, would withdraw his name, since he has
entered the race chiefly to block a third term.</p>

<p>For Vice President, Roosevelt is supposed to be supporting his
newly appointed Attorney-General, Robert H. Jackson, whom last year
the Corcoran-Cohen group favored for Governor of New York. Jackson,
however, would be stiffly fought by Garner and, probably, Farley.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>To Run or Not to Run?</h4>

<p class="fst">It should not be imagined, however, that the &ldquo;I do not
choose&rdquo; statement (and the rumors expecting it are doubtless
correct) will end the third term issue. The potential candidate who
does not choose, can always be &ldquo;drafted&rdquo; &ndash; for, as
it would be explained, the good of the Party and the country. Even if
Roosevelt had actually reached an irrevocable decision not to run
again, he would hardly say so with 100% clarity, since this would
eliminate him not only as a candidate but as a factor in the party
machine and at the convention.</p>

<p>But there is no reason to believe that Roosevelt has reached such
an irrevocable decision. On the contrary, it seems fairly clear that
Roosevelt is ready to run again if he thinks he can get away with it.</p>

<p>It is even clearer that most of the leaders in the national party
machine do not want him to run. Some of them, like Garner and Glass,
do really consider him dangerous politically. Others are afraid of
the popular effect of a break from the anti-third term tradition.
Many, like Farley, get disturbed by his often erratic and headstrong
moves, and would like someone in office who would be more docile and
&ldquo;regular&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is an indisputable fact that the overwhelming
majority of the rank and file Democratic voters are in favor of
Roosevelt&rsquo;s running again; and that a decisive majority of the
voters of all parties are still pro-Roosevelt. As a public
personality, no candidate in either party comes within striking
distance of Roosevelt. Party machines are very powerful, but they run
a suicidal risk when they go headlong against popular sentiment.</p>

<p>The drawing appeal of the Presidential candidate is, as
Attorney-General Jackson took recent occasion to point out, of
particular importance to the Democratic party. Since the World War,
the Republicans have always been able to count on at least 14,000,000
votes in a Presidential election; but the Democratic vote has varied
from 8,000,000 to Roosevelt&rsquo;s 27,000,000 in 1936. These figures
show that the Democrats must be able to swing the unattached voters
in order to win, and it is hard to see that a man so old, and so
colorless as a public figure, as Hull could be safely counted on to
do the trick.</p>

<p>It is of the greatest significance to observe that the firmest
support for a third term (apart from the playboys in the
Administration, who don&rsquo;t count much when it comes to votes) is
appearing from the hardened big-city bosses, like Hague in New Jersey
and the Kelly-Nash gang in Chicago. Tammany, in New York, is reported
ready to go along. The New Leader, which is also 100% third term, has
embarrassing allies!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Will Roosevelt Run Again?</h4>

<p class="fst">Roosevelt&rsquo;s New Deal lives now only as a memory. In most
respects he is to the right even of the current Congress. He has
dropped all mention of the &ldquo;Lend-Spend&rdquo; program that he
got so many headlines for last summer. He has proposed such drastic
reductions in relief that Congress will probably increase them over
his budget figures. He is ready, without resistance, to let the NLRB
and the Wage- Hour Administration be altered further in favor of the
bosses. He is backing the G-Men to the hilt in their drive against
labor rights.</p>

<p>On the domestic front, Roosevelt&rsquo;s program is a complete
shambles. All that he has left is the war, toward which he is driving
with such recklessness that Congress, feeling something of the
pressure of the people, is compelled now and then to draw him back &ndash;
as in attempts to cut down armament expenditures or to block an
outright war loan to Finland.</p>

<p>But it is precisely his bold attitude toward the war that
recommends Roosevelt to widening circles in Wall Street; and even the
memory of the New Deal has more substance in the eyes of the people
than any program that his opponents have brought forth.</p>

<p>Roosevelt is so strong because none of the other representatives
of the bosses have anything at all to offer &ndash; except the war,
and Roosevelt has monopolized first claim on the war; and because
labor has failed to strike out on an independent road. If the only
shelter to be seen is a pig-sty, then it will seem that we will have
to remain in the pig-sty, even that we will try to pretend to
ourselves that the pig-sty is a palace.</p>

<p>Since these things are so, it seems probable that the Democratic
party will have to re-nominate Roosevelt, that it cannot risk losing
that smile, those memories, and that ruthless hand on the reins of
the war chariot. And if he runs, how can the New York cop, Dewey, or
the Ohio platitude, Taft, or the Michigan vacuum, Vandenberg, expect
to beat him?</p>
