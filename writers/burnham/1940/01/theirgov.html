<p class="fst">There was no recess in the war moves of the Roosevelt
administration after the close of the Special Session. Repeal of the
arms embargo was a major step in freeing the hands of the war-makers
for intervention, but they did not rest on their oars. Nor will they
rest until this country takes its place as a full-fledged
belligerent. I want here to review a few of the landmarks of recent
weeks in the trail toward war:</p>

<p class="fst">1. Two days after the scuttling of the it was revealed that the
United States had played the decisive role in forcing the German ship
to leave the docks at Montevideo. The legal rights under
international law, in this case as in all others, are obscure. The
result is obvious: a unilateral blow was struck at Germany, one of
the belligerent powers.</p>

<p class="fst">2. A British cruiser chased a German freighter into Ft.
Lauderdale, Florida. The evidence of eyewitnesses indicates that the
cruiser violated not merely the &ldquo;safety zone&rdquo; established
by the Panama Conference but the territorial waters of the United
States. This violation was supposed to be &ldquo;investigated&rdquo;.
The investigation has quietly dropped out of the news. Anyone who
still thinks that Roosevelt is neutral might well ask himself what
would have happened if a similar circumstance had taken place with
the battleship German and the freighter British.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Law Is What You Make It</h4>

<p class="fst">3. In connection with the war in Finland, Roosevelt has been
discovering the beauties of the device which he calls a &ldquo;moral
embargo&rdquo;. There is no sanction whatever in law or tradition for
these moral embargoes. They are, in fact, directly counter to the
avowed intentions of the various laws on neutrality which have passed
Congress; and, indeed, are counter to the whole professed theory of
American government, since they are actions taken solely by the
executive without any control or check whatever from Congress or the
Courts.</p>

<p>According even to the Roosevelt Neutrality Act, which passed the
Special Session, no credits can be granted to warring governments;
transfer of title on all goods for such governments must be completed
before shipment from this country; and ships of U.S. registry cannot
sail to ports of such governments.</p>

<p>When Roosevelt argued in public for his law, he made the people
believe that it would keep the U.S. free from involvement in the war.
When war began in Finland, presumably the Neutrality Act should have
been invoked at once. But it was not: Roosevelt has not found that a
&ldquo;state of war&rdquo; exists in Finland &ndash; apparently
having the same view on this point as the Kremlin. Consequently none
of the provisions of the Act apply: credit can be extended to the
belligerents, U.S. ships can sail to their ports, and so on. The
ground is laid for a whole series of those &ldquo;incidents&rdquo;
from which the people were told that the Neutrality Act would
guarantee avoidance.</p>

<p>But not merely has the law of the land been suspended. Roosevelt
has, through the invention of the &ldquo;moral embargo&rdquo;, a
grandiose new law of his own. The moral embargo, proclaimed by
Secretary of State Hull, prohibits shipment of airplanes, airplane
parts, bombs, airplane gasoline and gasoline refining equipment and
several other types of munitions to &ndash; not both belligerents,
which would have , been in line with the older neutrality law &ndash;
but to one, to the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>It might be thought that a moral embargo is merely a Platonic
gesture or at most a propaganda measure (which latter of course it
also is). But the truth is that the moral embargo is a hard and fast
kind of sanction. It is enforced by confidentially telling armament
manufacturers that if they break it they will no longer get U.S.
government orders.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>War Birds on Top of the Roost</h4>

<p class="fst">4. Last week Roosevelt appointed Charles Edison Secretary of the
Navy. Edison is a plain-speaking-man, who has
broadcast his opinions. He favors a &ldquo;two-ocean navy&rdquo;, big
enough to smash everything else afloat, and he believes, as he puts
it, in protecting this country by carrying the war as far as possible
away from its shores: that is, by sending U.S. soldiers to fight in
Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>For some months Louis Johnson, though still rated as Assistant
Secretary, has been running the War Office. Johnson is of exactly the
same war-mongering breed as Edison, and has among his other
accomplishments the distinction of perfecting the M-Day plans for the
war-time dictatorship.</p>

<p>Putting these two men in charge of the war machine is a complete
answer to those scoundrels who try to &ldquo;excuse&rdquo;
Roosevelt&rsquo;s &ldquo;errors&rdquo; as being due to the influence
of &ldquo;bad advisers&rdquo; who have managed to worm their way into
the administration. Johnson and Edison take their rightful place
alongside of Colonel Harrington, in charge of WPA, and Colonel
Fleming, now running the Wages and Hours administration. Roosevelt,
for all his smiles, deliberately picks for key positions those men
who can and will carry out his own ruthless policies.</p>

<p class="fst">5. Taking advantage of a loophole in a law, &ldquo;competitive
bidding&rdquo; on armament orders has, during the past few months,
been dumped. Competitive bidding was, it is true, often enough a
farce, but now and then &ndash; when there was genuine rivalry among
the companies concerned &ndash; it did serve to cut somewhat the
armament profits. Now the companies can write up their costs
virtually to where they please, and get a 10 per cent profit added
for good measure, with no chance for a rival concern to put in a
lower bid.</p>

<p class="fst">6. The bold and unprecedented act of sending Myron Taylor
(ex-Chairman of the U.S. Steel Corporation, by the way) as diplomatic
representative to the Vatican can only be understood as a means of
mobilizing Catholic opinion for &ldquo;national unity&rdquo; in
preparation for war. The Catholic hierarchy, because partly of its
leaning toward fascism and the tie-up between the Vatican and Rome,
is rather shy about Roosevelt&rsquo;s coming war &ndash; and the
Catholics are the most powerful and best organized of the religious
groups. Roosevelt&rsquo;s gesture &ndash; which cost a few demurrers
from Protestants &ndash; seems to have taken them 100 per cent into
camp.</p>
