<p class="fst">Politicians ordinarily use key words not so much to describe
clearly what they mean as for the sake of the feelings the words
arouse. Imagine, for example, what a difference it would make in the
public attitude if armament expenditures in the budget were listed
under the title, &ldquo;Imperialist Aggression,&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;National Defense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the funds for armaments which Roosevelt has proposed for the
fiscal year 1940&ndash;41 are worth thinking about. $1,800,000,000 are
included for the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; expenses of the army and navy.
$272,000,000 is asked as an emergency deficiency appropriation for
this year; and $302,000,000 for &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; items during
the coming fiscal year. These, totalling the colossal sum of
$2,374,000,000, only begin to indicate the true burden of war on the
community.</p>

<p>Interest on the public debt will come to $1,100,000,000. War and
armament expenditures during the past twenty-five years have amounted
to far more than the entire federal debt; and, since these
expenditures serve no conceivably useful social function, it is
entirely legitimate to charge the whole interest payment against war.
Pensions will come to $1,200,000,000; at least three-fourths
resulting from war. Out of the $1,100,000,000 listed for public
works, a minimum of several hundred millions will go to war projects.
Similarly with the $1,300,000,000 allotted for work relief. The
$1,000,000,000 for &ldquo;regular operating expenditures&rdquo;
includes at least a couple of hundred millions for activities of
State, War, Navy, Justice departments that would have no place except
for war.</p>

<p>Figured very conservatively, this will give us around:
$5,300,000,000 which last week Roosevelt proposed for war &ndash;
nearly two-thirds of the budget of the federal government. We can say
without exaggeration that governments in the modern imperialist world
have become, first and foremost, war-making machines.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What is to be Defended?</h4>

<p class="fst">When the phrase &ldquo;national defense&rdquo; is used about
armaments, it is designed to suggest certain pictures to the minds of
the ordinary honest people of the country. We imagine bombers
swarming over the cities, troops landing in California and Florida,
tanks storming down from Canada or up from Mexico. And it seems most
natural to think: &ldquo;Should we not have the means to defend
ourselves &ndash; our homes and children &ndash; from the invaders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even if we approached the problem from a purely military point of
view, and thought carefully about what the money is being spent for,
these pictures would rapidly disappear.</p>

<p>On the new program, for instance, are ten huge battleships either
already begun or soon to be started. Two of them are at present
designed to be of 45,000 tons displacement &ndash; the largest in the
world, costing $90,000,000 each. Still larger sizes are being
debated.</p>

<p>But battleships are not suited to defend the shores of a country
in a literal sense. They operate at a long distance from their bases.
Shore defenses feature submarines, mines, coastal artillery, mosquito
boats, etc. No imaginable attack against the shores of the United
States would require these battleships (though, for that matter, no
attack of any kind against the shores of the United States is
imaginable).</p>

<p>The truth is that the military expert&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;defensive&rdquo;
and &ldquo;offensive&rdquo; is completely different from that of the
layman. For the expert, the job is simply that of winning the given
war; and he adopts a defensive or offensive strategy, or shifts them,
in line with this single objective. He cannot permit himself the
sentimental luxury of preferring defense merely because it gives him
a better conscience.</p>

<p>And, in the case of a war against another nation or nations, the
fighting machine of this country is designed to carry on war
thousands of miles away from the shores. It is defensive only with
respect to an internal war: that is, to suppress a workers&rsquo;
revolution.</p>

<p>Those who honestly support Roosevelt&rsquo;s &ldquo;national
defense&rdquo; program because they believe its object is to
safeguard home and children are, whether they like it or not,
upholding a policy of aggressive external war. This can be clearly
seen from a military analysis alone.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>And Whose Nation?</h4>

<p class="fst">As always, the military objective is subordinate to the social and
political objectives. The government is building ah aggressive
military machine, designed for external combat far from the shores of
this country, because the government has an aggressive social and
political policy.</p>

<p>From this more fundamental point of view, it is correct to speak
of &ldquo;national defense,&rdquo; just as the armies and navies of
France and Germany and England are all part of their national
&ldquo;defenses.&rdquo; The purpose of the armed forces is to defend
the interests of the nation; and &ldquo;nation&rdquo; here means the
imperialist &lsquo; government, representative of the big bankers and
industrialists, of the Sixty Families.</p>

<p>But <em>defense</em> of these interests requires <em>offense</em>
against the interests of the peoples of South America, China, and
against rival powers and, above all, offense against the interests of
the people of the United States. The new budget shows this last point
in the most brazen fashion: in order to achieve funds for &ldquo;national
defense,&rdquo; the budget takes funds away from the people, from the
starving and homeless unemployed. Roosevelt&rsquo;s first line of
&ldquo;national defense&rdquo; is his <em>attack</em> on the living
standards and rights of the people of the United States.</p>

<p>It is in every way legitimate for the people to wish to defend
themselves and their homes and their freedom from any and all
enemies. But the chief enemy attacking the people is neither Hitler
nor Stalin nor the Mikado, but Roosevelt himself and his government:
it is his G-men who are smashing labor and democratic rights, his
whip that is slashing relief funds, his party that refuses to
establish humanly decent wages&rsquo; and hours&rsquo; standards, his
general staff that is completing its plans to hurl the youth of the
country into death far away, for the sake of his program of
imperialist expansion.</p>
