Minneapolis, Minn.
Dear Comrades:
Yesterday I attended a conference and mass meeting called ostensibly to hear Otto Wangerin of Chicago explain why new unions on the U.S. railroads were necessary.
The call was circulated among as many railroad workers as they thought safe and those who would not bother them with Trotskyism. Out of the tremendous force that the C.P. boasts, only three bona fide railroad workers were present. But this did not stop the hoodlums from expelling those who are not converted to the third period. When I arrived in the hall the giant minds were set into motion to find out who can best interpret this period. A tremendous struggle was waged amongst themselves, which took up a good portion of an hour. Finally unity was achieved and I was ordered out of the hall. Poor Otto Wangerin, his soul is not in the best of condition. But what can a poor fellow do who always bows before the almighty apparatus? After I left the hall the formulae was developed in detail and now the unity-purity squad will go on as ever before.

Dear Comrades:
The League in Minneapolis is carrying on real good work, which will bring in many new members from among the American workers. We are about to start a campaign to organize the general drivers into unions. We have very good connections in this particular industry. We are also carrying on work among the cab drivers with good results. A Left wing has been developed in the Amalgamated which meets regularly and has excellent connections.
The defense movement is going on fairly good with prospects of more mass support in the future.
Two classes have been organized by the League—one in the A.B.C. of Communism and the other on American labor history.
The Party is back in its underground days and is issuing manifestos and leaflets like then, only this time they are not numbered. The last one was about us “splitting” the labor defense when we tried to work with them and were expelled. I am called traitor, renegade and accused of making alliances with S.P., City Hall prosecutors, and A.F. of L. labor fakers. These leaflets are doing the Communist movement untold harm and the workers class the members of the Party as a bunch of crazy people. It will take years to live down these blunders.



 


Yours for Communism,
CARL SKOGLUND
