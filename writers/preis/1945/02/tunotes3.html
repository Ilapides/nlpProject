<h4>Wage &ldquo;Rollback&rdquo;</h4>

<p class="fst">A two-hour work stoppage last Friday of over 8,000 members of the
Pocketbook Workers Union (independent) in New York City served to
emphasize the fact that Roosevelt&rsquo;s War Labor Board is not
merely a wage-freezing but also a wage-cutting agency.</p>

<p>The stoppage occurred when the union called a huge mass meeting to
protest a WLB order eliminating bonuses, &ldquo;merit&rdquo; raises
and other recent wage increases in this notoriously low-pay industry.
For a large part of the workers, this would represent a pay-cut of
approximately 15 percent, reducing basic wages to between 55 cents
and 65 cents an hour. The manufacturers had to grant the increases in
order to prevent labor from being attracted away to higher-pay jobs.</p>

<p><em>Back a couple of years ago, the CIO and AFL officials sought to
quiet the workers&rsquo; demands for pay increases to offset price
rises by a campaign for price &ldquo;rollbacks.&rdquo; The price
&ldquo;rollbacks&rdquo; never materialized; in fact the
cost-of-living soared higher than ever. The only &ldquo;rollback&rdquo;
the administration has enforced is a &ldquo;rollback&rdquo; of wages
like this one.</em></p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<a id="p2"></a>
<h4>Paid Holidays</h4>

<p class="fst">CIO representatives at a WLB hearing in Washington last week
charged a &ldquo;gang-up&rdquo; by employers to eliminate standard
contractual pay for holidays not worked. The hearings were called on
appeals of more than 30 corporations against a New York WLB Regional
Board ruling that the established paid-holiday practice be continued
in pending new contracts.</p>

<p>Typical of employer arguments was the contention by a United
States Rubber Company official that paid holidays &ldquo;unstabilized&rdquo;
industry. He contended that &ldquo;absenteeism mounts and production
lags where workers receive a full day&rsquo;s pay for not working
when those who are asked to work receive only half-time in addition.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>This &ldquo;big-hearted&rdquo; employer doesn&rsquo;t want to
&ldquo;discriminate&rdquo; &ndash; so he&rsquo;s all for cutting out
paid holidays. The additional profits &ndash; of course &ndash; are
no consideration. He&rsquo;s just solely concerned about
&ldquo;production.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t hear any of these employers squawking about
&ldquo;absenteeism&rdquo; and &ldquo;production lags&rdquo; when
Roosevelt in 1942 ordered elimination of all premium pay for Sundays,
Saturdays and holidays as such. And we haven&rsquo;t heard any
subsequent clamor about the widespread reduction of double-time pay
to time-and-a-half for work on Sundays and holidays that fall on the
seventh day of the scheduled work-week.</p>

<p>But if the bosses are so worried about &ldquo;production lags&rdquo;
because they pay only an additional halftime pay for holiday work,
there&rsquo;s a very simple way for them to ease their minds. Restore
doubletime pay for work on all Sundays and holidays!</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<h4>Forced Work Transfers</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>The New Jersey CIO, through its president, Irving Abramson,
last week announced that it planned to resist a War Manpower
Commission scheme to institute a forced transfer of 18,000 workers in
the Newark area to &ldquo;more essential&rdquo; jobs. The WMC has
refused to guarantee that transferred workers&rsquo; pay will not be
reduced and that they will not lose their seniority in their present
jobs. That is what happened in Allentown, Pa., to several hundred
workers, the first victims of this scheme to force workers into the
low-pay industries from better jobs.</em></p>

<p>A committee from the state CIO conferred with the WMC state
director on February 2, after he failed even to acknowledge a letter
from Abramson stating the conditions under which the New Jersey CIO
would accept the &ldquo;referral&rdquo; plan. These include absolute
guarantees of no pay-cuts or loss of present seniority.</p>

<p>The head of the Newark WMC, George Pfaus, stated that the WMC had
&ldquo;no authority&rdquo; to make the guarantees demanded by the
CIO. But it has authority to compel certain employers to fire a
percentage of their workers and force these workers into any job the
WMC commands them to take. Pfaus added the cynical comment: &ldquo;If
some workers have to take pay cuts, they are just home-front
casualties.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Home-front casualties&rdquo; is right &ndash; victims of
union-busting, wage-slashing forced labor for private profit in the
class war of the employers and their government against the workers.</em></p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<<a id="p4"></a>
<h4>Miners&rsquo; Demands</h4>

<p class="fst">America&rsquo;s coal miners are preparing for their biennial
struggle against the coal operators and the government. Their
contract expires this April 1. The United Mine Workers, has already
served notice that it is going to press for substantial wage
increases when contract renewal negotiations begin.</p>

<p>The UMW came very near to cracking the Little Steel Formula in the
four historic general mine strikes of 1943. It won some increases,
including partial portal- to-portal pay. Now it is reported, the
union intends to demand a 25 per cent hourly wage increase, from the
present $1 an hour to $1.25. The miners are also seeking full
portal-to-portal pay instead of the present 50 per cent for travel
time within the mines to and from work.</p>

<p>The coal operators, who are making the biggest profits in their
history, have already begun their propaganda campaign against wage
increases and particularly against another strike. One leading coal
baron publicly wailed &ldquo;there can&rsquo;t be a strike in the
coal mines, in the United States or Canada. If there is, the miners
will be prolonging the war. A coal strike would create international
chaos.&rdquo; The miners will undoubtedly give the operators a chance
to avoid &ldquo;international chaos&rdquo; by agreeing to less
profits and more wages.</p>

<p><em>Coal miners in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have already voted
to strike on April 1 if the Canadian National War Labor Board refuses
to reverse its refusal to grant increases to the Canadian miners,
organized in District 26 of the United Mine Workers. The District 26
convention recently voted for strike action in the event of a
&ldquo;further unsatisfactory&rdquo; board decision.</em></p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<a id="p5"></a>
<h4>Fur Workers Fund</h4>

<p class="fst">The international executive board of the Stalinist-dominated CIO
Fur and Leather Workers Union voted at a recent meeting to establish
a Million Dollar Defense Fund to defeat a recalcitrant employer of
8,000 workers in New York City.</p>

<p>It seems that the Associated Fur Coat and Trimming Manufacturers,
Inc., has refused to comply with a WLB directive covering arbitration
of discharges and paid vacations which was issued last December.</p>

<p><em>The million dollars for &ldquo;defense&rdquo; will be devoted,
we may be sure, not to strike action &ndash; Teheran forbid! &ndash;
but to keep the Stalinist officials travelling back and forth in
style while &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; on the Washington WLB front.</em></p>
