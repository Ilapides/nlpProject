<p class="fst">Some workers undoubtedly still have the illusion that the
Roosevelt administration attempts to exercise &ldquo;impartiality&rdquo;
in arriving at wage decisions. But the reality is the exact opposite.
The rigmarole of War Labor Board hearings and other government
arbitration procedures is designed to conceal behind-the-scenes
conniving between the administration and the big employers.</p>

<p>The actual mechanics of one such conspiracy have been partially
disclosed by recent developments in the textile wage case, including
Director of Economic Stabilization Vinson&rsquo;s intervention in
this and other pending cases. This intervention came in the form of
his letter to the WLB &ldquo;requesting&rdquo; that agency to grant
no wage increases of any nature without prior approval of the Office
of Price Administration.</p>

<p><em>By his action, Vinson succeeded in blocking a final decision of
the WLB after it had indicated its intentions of lifting slightly the
&ldquo;sub-standard&rdquo; wages of the terribly exploited textile
workers. Further, he established an entirely new basis for &ldquo;settling&rdquo;
wage disputes. Not the &ldquo;merits of the case&rdquo; are the
criteria, but whether wage increases, however paltry, &ldquo;affect
costs and prices&rdquo; &ndash; as the profiteering corporations
always insist they do.</em></p>

<p>Moreover, final authority in wage disputes is no longer to reside
in the official arbitration agency, the WLB, but in the &ldquo;price
control&rdquo; agencies, where the unions do not even have formal
representation. Thus, the administration has contrived a neat device
for nullifying wage increases even in those few instances where the
WLB, in order to preserve its prestige as an &ldquo;impartial&rdquo;
agency, is compelled to grant &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; raises.</p>

<p>Apart from the obvious general fact that Roosevelt&rsquo;s
underlings and appointees, including Vinson, merely implement the
administration&rsquo;s wage and labor policies, in this particular
case there is concrete evidence that Vinson acted in accordance with
White House directions. Moreover, as we shall show, Vinson had a
secret &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; with the leading textile
manufacturers.</p>

<p>The first public knowledge of the general contents of Vinson&rsquo;s
letter to WLB chairman Davis came in a CIO statement of protest
issued in Washington on January 12. This statement also contained a
copy of a letter sent by Roosevelt to CIO President Murray.
Roosevelt&rsquo;s letter &ndash; into which the CIO leaders
attempted at first to read a message of &ldquo;hope&rdquo; &ndash; 
clearly indicates that the inspiration for Vinson&rsquo;s action came
straight from the White House.</p>

<p><em>In his letter discussing the administration&rsquo;s broad wage
policy, Roosevelt emphasized just one point &ndash; the effect of any
wage increases upon prices. &ldquo;Naturally, any proposals for a
change in our present policy must be considered in relation to their
probable effect upon the price structure and upon our general
anti-inflation program. The board (WLB), therefore, will submit its
report to Judge Vinson whom I then expect to advise me in light of
the board&rsquo;s findings, as well as all other relevant
information. As to objectives, we are in perfect agreement. We must
not permit the price level to rise.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>It may be noted with reference to the last sentence that the
compelling reason advanced by the unions to demand wage increases has
been precisely that prices have already risen &ndash; at least 45
per cent since January 1941.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">It can now be proved, further more, that Vinson acted not only
with Roosevelt&rsquo;s approval but also upon secret agreement with
the textile bosses. That is why Vinson&rsquo;s letter to the WLB was
timed to halt release of the WLB decision in the textile wage case.</p>

<p>The irrefutable evidence of this administration-employers
conspiracy to defraud the textile workers is contained in a document
made public on January 23 by Emil Rieve, President of the CIO Textile
Workers Union.</p>

<p>This revealing document is signed by William P. Jacobs, Executive
Director of the Print Cloth Group of Cotton Manufacturers, Clinton,
S.C. It is dated January 12, 1945. It is fittingly titled, <em>Another
Progress Report</em>.</p>

<p><em>The document begins:</em></p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;After spending another week in Washington, I
give you another confidential report on price ceilings and wages. On
this trip, I conferred with Judge Vinson, having previously conferred
with Justice Byrnes. He arranged the conference with Judge Vinson for
us.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst"><em>What a spirit of cordiality and cooperation!</em></p>

<p>The report goes on to confide: &ldquo;On wages the judge seemed
better informed and more interested but still non-committal.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Better informed and more interested&rdquo; here means
sympathetic to the sweat-shop operators&rsquo; view; &ldquo;non-committal&rdquo;
means cautiously refraining from any <em>open</em> commitments.</p>

<p>Then comes the real pay-off.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;This matter is now in his (Vinson&rsquo;s) hands,
and from the pressure that we know has now reached him it is possible
that FOR POLITICAL REASONS he may be forced to indefinitely hold the
matter, or he may recommend a basis somewhat lower than the WLB would
authorize. From conferences which I held I know that Justice Byrnes,
Senators George, Maybank, Russell and Governor Gardner, and perhaps
others have insisted that he do nothing which will wipe out the
traditional North-South differential.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">To what &ldquo;political reasons&rdquo; does this Southern
sweatshop representative refer? Obviously the need of the Roosevelt
regime to preserve its political ties with the powerful Southern
Democratic Bourbons. The whole deal was engineered through
Roosevelt&rsquo;s right-hand man, Byrnes, the so-called &ldquo;Assistant
President.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The report then observes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The interview (With Vinson) was satisfactory and
resulted in a hopeful conclusion, again indicating the effect of
pressure FROM HIGHER UP and perhaps from the letters which you have
written to members of Congress. I RAN INTO THAT AT MANY POINTS.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Such understanding and co-operation from the &ldquo;higher ups&rdquo;
and legislators! Indeed, the textile manufacturers had every reason
to anticipate a &ldquo;hopeful conclusion.&rdquo; And they were not
disappointed.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">It need merely be added that WLB chairman Davis is now engaged in
a bit of shadow-boxing with Vinson. Naturally, to prop up the WLB&rsquo;s
tottering authority, Davis is compelled to disclaim responsibility
for the administration&rsquo;s connivery. He is &ldquo;disputing&rdquo;
in a polite way with Vinson&rsquo;s &ldquo;interpretation&rdquo; &ndash;
 although conceding Vinson&rsquo;s authority to enforce his
&ldquo;interpretation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, Davis and Vinson have cooperated to keep their
skulduggery hidden from the workers. The United Press reported on
January 24 that the text of Vinson&rsquo;s letter <em>&ldquo;was made
available despite efforts of both WLB Chairman William H. Davis and
Mr. Vinson to prevent it from being made public.&rdquo;</em></p>
