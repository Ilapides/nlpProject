<p class="fst">Stalinist traitors in the CIO secretly button-holed Congressmen in
Washington and urged them to vote for the Roosevelt-sponsored
May-Bailey slave labor bill. This gave some House members a pretext
for &ldquo;shifting&rdquo; to support of the forced labor measure on
the grounds that &ldquo;labor&rdquo; was &ldquo;split&rdquo; on the
issue, it was disclosed by the New York daily <strong>PM</strong>, Jan. 31.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Stalinist Treachery</h4>

<p class="fst">The Stalinist treachery, according to <strong>PM</strong>, <em>&ldquo;was
revealed by the shift of several New York City Representatives who
said they had been visited over the weekend by delegations
representing Left-wing CIO locals and the Greater New York Industrial
Union Council who urged them to approve the May-Bailey Bill now under
debate.&rdquo;</em> &ldquo;Left-wing&rdquo; is <strong>PM</strong>&rsquo;s
customary misleading designation for the extreme right- wing
Stalinist reactionaries.</p>

<p><strong>PM</strong> reports further: &ldquo;&lsquo;I was nearly knocked off
my feet,&rsquo; one Congressman said. &lsquo;I thought labor was solidly
opposed to the bill and I had intended to vote against it. With this
division of opinion, however, I intend to go along with the
Commander-in-Chief, unless the bill is amended to discriminate
further against labor.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Exposed by <strong>PM</strong>&rsquo;s revelations, Earl Browder&rsquo;s
Communist (Stalinist) Political Association and its union stooges are
frantically attempting to cover up their naked betrayal. The
notorious Stalinist hatchet-men, Michael Quill and Saul Mills, acting
president and secretary respectively of the Greater New York CIO
Council, issued a &ldquo;denial&rdquo; which denied absolutely
nothing. They simply pointed to a &ldquo;for the record&rdquo;
resolution passed several weeks ago in the Council as &ldquo;proof.&rdquo;
But they carefully refrained from denying that Stalinist CIO
officials had acted &ldquo;unofficially,&rdquo; as <strong>PM</strong>
reported.</p>

<p>A virtual confession of the truth of <strong>PM</strong>&rsquo;s specific
charges is contained, however, in the <strong>Daily Worker</strong>, February
1, which devotes an entire page to an &ldquo;answer.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;answer&rdquo; does not attempt to deny <strong>PM</strong>&rsquo;s
facts. It seeks to divert attention from the real charges by a
hysterical counter-attack against &ldquo;the usual attempt of certain
elements ... to find &lsquo;splits&rsquo; in the CIO.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not only does the <strong>Daily Worker</strong> slide around the specific
charges, but it tries to justify the treacherous act of its union
stooges. It claims there is a &ldquo;considerable&quot; difference of
opinion on the May-Bailey bill in the labor movement. &ldquo;The
<strong>Daily Worker</strong> has often in the past differed with many labor
leaders, and labor leaders have even more often disagreed with the
<strong>Daily Worker</strong>. There is nothing so strange about that.&rdquo;
Etc,</p>

<p><em>Not a line about whether or not Stalinist officials in the CIO
acted as strikebreakers against the entire labor movement by misusing
their union titles to lobby for Congressional votes for the most
dangerous piece of union busting legislation ever cooked up by the
American capitalists.</em></p>

<p>Most of the article is devoted to &ldquo;our stand on the manpower
issue.&rdquo; The <strong>Daily Worker</strong> brazenly touts the May-Bailey
bill and wants labor to embrace the bill as &ldquo;its own.&rdquo;
Labor is advised not &ldquo;to allow initiative on the May bill to
its enemies.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t wait for others to put the noose on
your neck, put it on yourself!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Deadly Enemies</h4>

<p class="fst">The <strong>Daily Worker</strong> tries to claim that &ldquo;national
service&rdquo; is just the thing for labor. Didn&rsquo;t the demand
for it come &ldquo;from President Roosevelt, certainly not an enemy
of labor&rdquo;? Moreover, the <strong>Daily Worker</strong> gives its own word
for it that &ldquo;all the talk about national service being
&lsquo;slavery&rsquo; and violation of the freedom of contract is
just plain poppycock.&rdquo; Rising to a frenzied crescendo, the
<strong>Worker</strong> howls: &ldquo;How will Hitler and Hirohito take it if
such a measure is defeated?&rdquo; Thus according to the <strong>Daily
Worker</strong>, Hitler and Hirohito are rooting to beat hell for the
American workers to remain free from forced labor.</p>

<p><em>Once more the Stalinists expose themselves as the deadliest
internal enemies of the American labor movement. They are ready to
commit any crime against the working class in the interests of the
Kremlin&rsquo;s diplomatic alliance with Wall Street.</em> In every
wartime defensive struggle of the workers, the Stalinists have yelped
with the reactionary pack trying to drag labor down. They advocate a
permanent no-strike pledge. They conduct the most vicious and
unremitting slander campaigns against union militants. They hail
every act of government strikebreaking. They boast of open finkery,
as in the Montgomery Ward strikes. Now they sneak behind the back of
the labor movement to help the capitalist government aim its forced
labor knife.</p>

<p>For its own safety, American labor must ruthlessly call to account
the sinister Stalinist traitors. Stalinism will poison and ultimately
destroy the unions if it is permitted to spread further through the
body of labor.</p>
