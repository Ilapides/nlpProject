<p class="fst">Confronted by mounting labor opposition to his &ldquo;National
Service&rdquo; scheme for regimenting the workers and undermining the
unions, Roosevelt and his leading brass hats are pressing ever more
urgently for speedy enactment of the May-Bailey forced labor draft
bill, now before Congress. This bill contains features more harsh in
some instances than the original Nazi slave labor code on which the
Roosevelt plan is modeled and which inspired his cynical slogan,
&ldquo;This is a war of free labor against slave labor.</p>

<p>The success of the administration&rsquo;s conspiracy to enslave
American labor in the interests of the profiteering corporations
required the strategy of speed and surprise. Roosevelt&rsquo;s plot,
therefore, was to shove through a forced labor bill before the labor
movement had time to mobilize its ranks for resistance and before his
sinister anti-labor intent could be fully exposed.</p>

<p>With this aim of speed in mind, Roosevelt timed his renewed forced
labor drive to go into high gear at the moment when popular fear of a
prolonged war slaughter was at its height, during the unexpected
military reverses on the Belgian front. Roosevelt unleashed a
fraudulent propaganda scare-campaign about munitions &ldquo;shortages&rdquo;
that was designed to play upon the fears of the masses for their
loved ones in the battle lines and break down their opposition to
labor regimentation.</p>

<p>However, despite the careful planning of the administration, its
forced labor blitz timetable has already been upset. It has run into
several unforeseen obstacles, causing delays which increasingly
imperil the administration&rsquo;s original scheme.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Anti-Labor Amendments</h4>

<p class="fst">One unanticipated snag has been created by the very eagerness of
reactionary Congressmen to respond in the same labor-hating spirit as
Roosevelt&rsquo;s forced labor demand. In their desire to
&ldquo;strengthen&rdquo; the bill and eliminate any possibility of
loopholes, Roosevelt&rsquo;s more unrestrained Congressional
colleagues, particularly from the Democratic South, are competing to
attach to the forced labor measure all sorts of cruder anti-labor
amendments. Their slobbering eagerness to embrace Roosevelt&rsquo;s
plan and even &ldquo;improve&rdquo; it has not only delayed its
enactment but exposed the original bill for the viciously antilabor
measure that it is.</p>

<p>One amendment was designed to undermine union security by
abrogating closed shop union contracts for workers forced into jobs
in closed-shop plants. Another was intended to make all strikes
illegal. Differences arose among the Congressmen as to the most
effective means for enforcing the labor draft scheme. Some wanted
&ldquo;work-or-fight&rdquo; penalties. Some wanted to establish
&ldquo;slacker work battalions&rdquo; under Army rule. Others
preferred &ldquo;civilian&rdquo; penalties &ndash; $10,000 fines and
5 years imprisonment.</p>

<p>Fearful that all these amendments were stalling the bill and
exposing its real slave labor character, Roosevelt&rsquo;s aides
rushed to Congress and insisted that it hold back all the trimmings
until the basic measure is passed. Under this pressure, the House
Military Affairs Committee eliminated the anti-strike, anti-closed
shop, &ldquo;work-or-fight&rdquo; and &ldquo;slacker battalions&rdquo;
amendments. The committeemen were aware that the bill as it stands,
which enables the administration to move workers in and out of jobs
at will under threat of huge fines and imprisonment, is sufficiently
broad and drastic to satisfy even the most hard-bitten,
fascist-minded employers.</p>

<p>The administration wants speed, in addition, because the change in
the military, picture, due especially to the Red Army offensive
toward Berlin, has reduced the popular fear of a prolonged war. Talk
of an immediate Allied offensive &ndash; with assurances that there
are now sufficient munitions for it &ndash; has reduced the effect of
the munitions &ldquo;shortage&rdquo; scare.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Fake Shortage</h4>

<p class="fst">Most of all, the real facts about the &ldquo;need&rdquo; for
forced labor due to manpower shortages are coming to light. The Mead
Senate War Investigating Committee, for instance, has disclosed
&ldquo;labor hoarding&rdquo; and huge waste of manpower at the
Norfolk Naval Yard, where the officials had been clamoring for &ldquo;4,000
more workers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The War Production Board report for December showed that despite
the holiday letdown substantial increases in all the major munitions
programs were registered. During the last half of 1944, the WPB
report admitted, &ldquo;every one of the critical programs showed a
substantial gain&rdquo; ranging from 20 to over 200 per cent.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Roosevelt&rsquo;s Moves</h4>

<p class="fst">And then came the startling disclosure by John L. Lovett, Michigan
Manufacturers&rsquo; Association general manager, that in the
allegedly key &ldquo;tight spot,&rdquo; Detroit, the factories are in
position to handle 20 per cent more war contracts and that 50,000
experienced workers are right now forced to live off unemployment
compensation.</p>

<p>CIO United Automobile Workers President R.J. Thomas put his finger
on the biggest flaw in the claim of manpower &ldquo;shortage.&rdquo;
He last week challenged the government estimate of 700,000
unemployed, declaring there were no less than 5,000,000 workers
seeking jobs. &ldquo;The bureau (Labor Statistics) must be thinking
of 700,000 white men,&rdquo; Thomas declared. &ldquo;My estimate
includes what they overlooked &ndash; the women and Negroes able and
wanting to work in war plants and other essential industries.&rdquo;
But the House Military Affairs Committee struck out from the
May-Bailey bill a clause prohibiting discrimination against workers
for racial, religious or similar reasons.</p>

<p>Without even waiting for legislation, the administration has
already begun to initiate its forced labor scheme. Allentown, Pa.,
has been selected as the first test spot. There last week, under
orders of the War Manpower Commission, a group of brewery workers
were fired from their jobs and forced to take work in designated
plants at lower pay and longer hours.</p>

<p>If the administration succeeds in achieving its aims in this
instance, it plans to spread the same scheme everywhere. By hook or
by crook, Roosevelt intends to impose industrial regimentation upon
the American working class. This Nazi-like scheme can still be
smashed, however, if the entire labor movement goes into united
fighting action against it.</p>
