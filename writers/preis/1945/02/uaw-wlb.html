<p class="fst"><strong>The International Executive Board of the CIO United Automobile
Workers, largest and most dynamic union in the country, last week
adopted a resolution calling on the CIO to withdraw its support from
Roosevelt&rsquo;s War Labor Board. The resolution stated that this
government agency has now become &ldquo;a useless instrument.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p><em>This blow to the tottering prestige of the War Labor Board was
occasioned by a ruling of Director of Economic Stabilization Vinson,
who directed the WLB to make no further wage increase grants without
prior approval of the Office of Price Administration, This, in
effect, removes all final authority from the WLB to another agency on
which labor has not even formal representation.</em></p>

<p>The UAW-CIO leaders&rsquo; action came as the climax to a whole
series of rotten deals handed labor by the Roosevelt administration
in connection with a nod through the War Labor Board. In its three
years of existence, the WLB has earned among the workers the title of
&ldquo;Graveyard of Grievances.&rdquo; Major wage cases in auto,
packinghouse, textile, rubber, glass and aluminum, have been stalled
as much as two years; The steel wage case was &ldquo;settled&rdquo;
with all major wage demands denied. At the same time, the WLB
pussyfooted endlessly with powerful open-shop employers like Avery.</p>

<p>This has produced a violent revulsion among the workers; The
hostility to the WLB is expressed most sharply in the auto workers
union, where opposition to compulsory arbitration and the no-strike
surrender policy have forced the holding of a national referendum on
the no-strike pledge.</p>

<p>Today, almost every worker recognizes what The Militant has
contended since the WLB was first established &ndash; that the WLB
was designed to shackle the workers to compulsory arbitration, impose
the wage-freeze, curb independent militant labor action. From the
start, the &ldquo;impartiality&rdquo; of the WLB was a deliberate
fraud.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>WLB Anti-Labor</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>The rising indignation of the auto workers and the complete
exposure of the WLB as a procorporation, wage- freezing,
strikebreaking instrument of the capitalist government has finally
compelled the UAW leaders to echo the demand of the ranks that labor
get off the WLB. This is a belated confession of the WLB&rsquo;s
anti-labor function and character.</em></p>

<p>But the UAW leaders themselves share responsibility for foisting
the board on the workers. The UAW tops, along with all the other
labor lackeys of Roosevelt, were the original advocates and
supporters of the WLB. For three years, they have been selling the
WLB to the auto workers as a substitute for the strike weapon. They
assured the workers that the &ldquo;impartial&rdquo; WLB would take
care of labor&rsquo;s just demands. They served on the board, lent
their names to it, gave it a &ldquo;labor&rdquo; cover, bolstered it
up for three years.</p>

<p>It was the Trotskyists in the unions who from the very beginning
conducted a tireless campaign exposing the real nature and purpose of
the WLB as a government instrument of the employers. The
Trotskyists have consistently called for the withdrawal of all union
representatives and support from this anti-labor government body.
For this, the Trotskyist workers were slandered as &ldquo;obstructors&rdquo;
and even &ldquo;Hitler agents&rdquo; by those very UAW leaders who
today call for the scrapping of the WLB.</p>

<p><em>However, the UAW executive board&rsquo;s resolution on, the WLB
by no means indicates that these leaders really mean business. They
are making only another gesture to appease the auto workers&rsquo;
wrath. If the UAW chiefs were serious about withdrawing labor support
from the WLB, they wouldn&rsquo;t stop with mere appeals to Philip
Murray and the CIO. UAW President R. J. Thomas himself would take the
first step and demonstratively resign from the WLB. All UAW officials
on WLB regional bodies would be immediately instructed to leave them
flat.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Stay on WLB</h4>

<p class="fst">Why don&rsquo;t the UAW leaders get off the corporation-dominated
WLB ? Because the WLB &ndash; or some similar phony set-up with a
different title &ndash; is the only program these labor fakers have
to offer the auto workers in return for giving up their only
effective union weapon, the right to strike. The top UAW bureaucrats
are united in appealing to the auto workers to reaffirm the no-strike
pledge in the union&rsquo;s current referendum. They have repeatedly
aided the corporations and government to break &ldquo;unauthorized&rdquo;
strikes provoked by the bosses. But if the WLB is an anti-labor
fraud, what then do these &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; offer in place of the
right to strike ?</p>

<p>Another government compulsory arbitration board! A freshly-painted
1945 model, with a different name, in which the bosses and
government can induce the auto workers to take another ride. That&rsquo;s
what the executive board means by its complaint that the WLB now has
&ldquo;neither the authority nor the standing it had when it was
created.&rdquo; The WLB is so discredited that some other agency is
needed to hoax the workers. And that&rsquo;s precisely what the UAW
board resolution proposes.</p>

<p>At the same time, by whining about the WLB and calling for the CIO
to withdraw its support, the UAW leaders are trying to refurbish
themselves as &ldquo;militants&rdquo; in the eyes of the auto
workers. However, their very admissions about the WLB expose the
bankruptcy of their whole past policy of servile compliance, with the
Roosevelt labor program. The auto workers can place not an iota of
trust in these bureaucrats!</p>

<p>Only a completely new, progressive leadership, controlled by the
rank and file, which will really fight for a genuine labor program,
can give effective, militant guidance to the auto workers. The auto
workers need a leadership which stands foursquare on a fighting
program.</p>

<p><em>The indispensable accompaniment to the withdrawal of labor
support from the WLB is to scrap the no-strike pledge. That is the
decisive issue before the auto workers &ndash; and all workers &ndash;
 today. That is the only way labor can disentangle itself from the
red-tape of government compulsory arbitration, halt the corporation
provocations, and take up in earnest the challenge of the
open-shoppers.</em></p>
