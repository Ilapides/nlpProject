<h4>Telephone Workers</h4>

<p class="fst">Last month, inspired by the November strike of the Ohio, Michigan
and Washington, D.C., operators, 17,000 local and long distance
telephone workers in New York overwhelmingly voted to strike for a
general $5 weekly raise. Their demands had been stalled by the
companies and WLB for over two years. Before the 30-day &ldquo;cooling
off&rdquo; period imposed under the Smith-Connally Act was concluded,
a WLB telephone wage panel hastily recommended granting the $5
increase, and the company representatives conceded to a $4 raise.</p>

<p>Continuing their demand for the full $5, the local Traffic
Employees Association of the New York Telephone Co. and the
Federation of Long Lines Telephone Workers of the American Telegraph
and Telephone Co., agreed to postpone strike action pending a final
decision of the WLB&rsquo;s National Telephone Panel in Washington.</p>

<p>WLB panels have also recommended increases for telephone workers
in other leading cities who had either participated in the
Thanksgiving week strike or threatened to follow this example.</p>

<p><em>The organized telephone operators have thus demonstrated that
the strike weapon is the only effective means of getting speedy
action from the government and corporations and securing the
possibility for workers to win their wage demands.</em></p>

<h4>*</h4>

<a id="p2"></a>
<h4>UAW and WLB</h4>

<p class="fst"><strong>The Militant</strong> last week reported the action of the CTO
United Automobile Workers international executive board in calling on
the CIO to withdraw its members from the War Labor Board. The text of
the resolution has been made public in the current issue of the UAW&rsquo;S
official publication, the <strong>United Automobile Worker</strong>.</p>

<p>While enumerating a long series of complaints against the WLB,
whose procedure is termed a &ldquo;time-wasting, meaningless
rigmarole,&rdquo; the UAW board still upholds the principle of
compulsory arbitration. Their grievance is not that the WLB was
specifically organized to curb labor, but that it &ldquo;has no
authority to act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The UAW bureaucrats, who are united in fearful opposition to
rescinding the no-strike pledge in the current UAW referendum, are
clamoring for a &ldquo;new&rdquo; board. This will differ from the
WLB only in that its &ldquo;prerogatives&rdquo; would be more
&ldquo;comprehensive, clearly defined.&rdquo; That is, more binding
upon the workers.</p>

<p><em>The resolution makes so bold as to declare that Roosevelt
&ldquo;cannot escape full responsibility for the present inaction and
indecision of the WLB.&rdquo; When did these pro-Roosevelt lackeys
discover that? They denied that before the elections. They themselves
for three years bolstered and gave a labor cover to the WLB.</em></p>

<p>We repeat what <strong>The Militant</strong> wrote last week. The UAW
bureaucrats don&rsquo;t mean business.</p>

<p>They are trying to put on a &ldquo;militant&rdquo; front and save
face among the auto workers who are becoming thoroughly aroused
against the cowardly policies of the officialdom.</p>

<p>The auto militants are demonstrating through their campaign to
revoke the no-strike pledge that they oppose the whole policy of
dependence on capitalist &ldquo;friends of labor&rdquo; and
government boards. They are learning to have faith only in their own
organized strength in action. That&rsquo;s the only policy that can
win an iota for the workers in this period.</p>

<h4>*</h4>

<a id="p3"></a>
<h4>Westinghouse</h4>

<p class="fst">The National Westinghouse Conference Board, of the CIO Electrical,
Radio and Machine Workers, representing 80,000 Westinghouse Electric
Workers, recently issued a demand to Roosevelt for a general wage
increase of 17 cents an hour.</p>

<p>They appealed to Roosevelt &ldquo;to counteract the failures and
blunders of his subordinates by granting an immediate national
cost-of-living wage adjustment of 17 cents an hour retroactive to
Jan. 1, 1944.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Of course, Roosevelt&rsquo;s subordinates committed no
&ldquo;failures and blunders.&rdquo; They very capably fulfilled
their function of frustrating the demands of the workers in
accordance with the policies laid down by Roosevelt himself.</em></p>

<p>Nevertheless, this wage raise demand from an important section of
a union notoriously dominated by the reactionary Stalinists is a
significant sign. It indicates growing pressure from the UE ranks.
For the Stalinist UE leaders certainly would like to suppress the
embarrassing clamor for cost-of-living wage increases.</p>

<h4>*</h4>

<a id="p4"></a>
<h4>Secretary Addes</h4>

<p class="fst">UAW-CIO Secretary-Treasurer George Addes must have been born with
two tongues in his mouth. One tongue could not possibly stand the
strain of the double-talk he pours forth.</p>

<p>Addes, as is known to all among the auto workers, represents the
extreme right wing in the UAW leadership and has for several years
maintained a bloc with the Stalinists. He is among the most
unrestrained flag-wavers and abject labor lieutenants of Roosevelt
trying to maintain the no-strike pledge.</p>

<p>So it might come as a surprise to those unacquainted with the
remarkable quality of double-talk put but by Addes, to read his
remarks on the Forced Labor Bill in his column, <em>Secretary Addes
Says</em>, in the <strong>United Automobile Worker</strong>, February 1.</p>

<p>Addes, a henchman of the Stalinists who support the &ldquo;National
Service&rdquo; scheme of Roosevelt, complains:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;When we wrote our column a month ago protesting
against those who were openly advocating a national service law, we
had no idea that President Roosevelt would once again join their
ranks ... Whether President Roosevelt actively Campaigns for passage
of a national service law or lets it die a peaceful death, as he did
last year, might possibly be the answer to some of the questions we
are today asking.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">Three lies in two sentences:</p>

<ol>
<li>Roosevelt didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;join the ranks&rdquo; of forced
labor advocates; he has spearheaded their offensive.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Roosevelt did not &ldquo;let it die last year;&rdquo; he just
shut up about it prior to the elections &ndash; as did Addes.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Addes never asked any questions about Roosevelt. But if he
has some, let him speak out.</li>
</ol>
