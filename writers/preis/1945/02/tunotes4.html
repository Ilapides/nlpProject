<h4>Gang-Up on Miners</h4>

<p class="fst">The government agencies and coal operators are laying down, their
preliminary joint barrage in; anticipation of the impending struggle
against the mine workers. Negotiations for a union contract renewal
begin March 1 with the bituminous mine owners and April 1 with the
anthracite bosses.</p>

<p>An editorial in the February 15 <strong>United Mine Workers Journal</strong>
warns the miners that &ldquo;poisoned publicity designed to arouse
the populace against any and all wage demands&rdquo; is already being
widely peddled.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The membership of the UMWA may just as well know
how the deck is stacked in advance of the policy committee meeting
and wage negotiations. It is a formidable opposition.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>All the government agencies are &ldquo;backing the attack
against the UMW&rdquo; declares the editorial.</em></p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;The lineup includes Director of War
Mobilization James Byrnes, Director of Stabilization Fred Vinson, the
WLB, the Solid Fuels Administration, the OPA, the Roosevelt
administration and the coal operators, all concentrating upon
utilizing an assumed authority under executive decrees and the
infamous Smith-Connally enslavement law to deny the mine workers&rsquo;
wage demands on toto, regardless of the economic justice of the UMWA
wage proposals.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">The editorial charged Secretary of Interior Ickes with &ldquo;planting&rdquo;
statements in the public press designed to prejudice the miners&rsquo;
case and discredit the UMW leaders. It further charged that one of
the primary reason&rsquo;s for Vinson&rsquo;s recent ruling requiring
OPA approval prior to any WLB grant of &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; wage
increases is &ldquo;to stop the UMWA.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>It is reported that the UMW&rsquo;s policy committee, which
meets to formulate demands on February 26, will consider a demand for
a 25 per cent hourly wage increase, from $1 to $1.25, and full
portal-to-portal pay instead of the present approximately 50 per cent
won in the 1943 general coal strikes.</em></p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<a id="p2"></a>
<h4>UMW and AFL</h4>

<p class="fst">Of great importance for the impending miners&rsquo; struggle is
the outcome of the negotiations for reaffiliation of the UMW, with
its over 600,000 members, to the AFL.</p>

<p>The AFL executive council meeting in Miami, Fla., last week voted
to accept the UMW&rsquo;s request for reaffiliation with an apparent
major concession to the mine union on the chief issue previously
blocking the reaffiliation. That was the matter of jurisdictional
disputes, especially around the disposition of District 50, the UMW&rsquo;s
organization for coal by-products workers. The AFL leaders agreed to
accept the UMW &ldquo;as is,&rdquo; with jurisdictional questions to
be ironed out after reaffiliation.</p>

<p><em>However, a further obstacle has arisen with the UMW&rsquo;s
insistence upon a post on the AFL executive council. The council
members contend they have no power to give Lewis such a post without
approval of the AFL convention. This new issue, it appears, will not
halt further negotiations, as AFL President William Green is reported
to be getting together with UMW President John L. Lewis for
additional parleys.</em></p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<a id="p3"></a>
<h4>Not Out Yet!</h4>

<p class="fst">The CIO United Automobile Workers, through its executive board,
has declared &ldquo;Three Strikes on WLB.&rdquo; The union&rsquo;s
official organ, the <strong>United Automobile Worker</strong>, February 15,
announces the decision of the board calling on the CIO to &ldquo;quit&rdquo;
the WLB. The paper states:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The &lsquo;little steel formula&rsquo; froze
labor&rsquo;s pay and deprived the War Labor Board of any authority
to grant increases. STRIKE ONE! Current orders from &lsquo;assistant
President&rsquo; James F. Byrnes, transmitted through &lsquo;Stabilization
Director&rsquo; Judge Vinson, deprives the War Labor Board of the
right to grant labor any concessions on &lsquo;fringe&rsquo; economic
issues, such as correction of inequalities, shift bonuses, severance
pay, etc. STRIKE TWO! Federal Judge Philip L. Sullivan, declaring
that government operation of the Montgomery Ward stores is illegal,
has ruled that War Labor Board decisions cannot be enforced, they are
merely &lsquo;advisory.&rsquo; STRIKE THREE AND OUT!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">However the WLB is not &ldquo;out&rdquo; yet &ndash; and neither
are the UAW officials on the WLB. Three strikes doesn&rsquo;t
disqualify in this game where the rules are made by the government
and the employers. In fact, the UAW, whose president R.J. Thomas and
other officials still function on the WLB, are still &ldquo;playing
ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This game should never have been started, because the rules were
all stacked against labor from the start. The UAW board just wants
the WLB to retire to the dugout, but offers to give the big business
government another chance at bat against labor with a new board.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<a id="p4"></a>
<h4>NLRB Strike Polls</h4>

<p class="fst">A real indication of the mood of the workers toward the no-strike
policy is shown by the record of strike votes conducted during the
past 12 months by the NLRB under the Smith-Connally Anti-Strike Act.</p>

<p><em>Seventy-one percent of the 98,224 workers voting in 381 strike
polls favored strike action. Strike majorities resulted in 323 of the
381 voting units. Only 34 voted against strike. In 63 per cent of the
cases where unions filed notices for strike, the notices were
withdrawn before the vote, after mere notice of intent served to
speed up settlements. In many cases after strike votes were taken,
walkouts did not occur because settlements were hastily concluded.</em></p>

<p>These figures would indicate that the mere threat of strike backed
by a solid vote of the workers in a number of instances proved
effective in halting government and employer stalling on union
grievances.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<a id="p5"></a>
<h4>Employment Decline</h4>

<p class="fst">Another exposure of Roosevelt&rsquo;s phony manpower &ldquo;shortage&rdquo;
claim, which he deliberately cooked up in an attempt to push through
his forced labor scheme, was presented by UAW Secretary-Treasurer
Addes to Senate committee hearings last week on, the May-Bailey slave
labor bill.</p>

<p>Addes presented figures showing a 16 per cent employment decline
in Detroit, key war-plants center. A survey of 192 major war plants
showed a drop of 57,000 workers from the level of 347,000 in
December, 1943, to the January 1945 level of 289,000. This would
indicate a total decline of 100,000 from the Detroit employment peak
of 700,000.</p>

<p><em>CIO Textile Workers President Emil Rieve disclosed that two
thousand textile workers in the New Bedford area are threatened with
unemployment because Army officials have demanded transfer of 800 key
workers, whose removal from their present jobs would jeopardize
production.</em></p>
