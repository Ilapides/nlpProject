<p class="fst">William H. Davis, chairman of the pro-corporation War Labor Board,
last week came out with a prize example of hypocrisy. Trying to
conceal the Board&rsquo;s function as the &ldquo;graveyard of
grievances,&rdquo; Davis complained that the Board is receiving too
many cases which could be settled by direct negotiations between
unions and employers.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Too often,&rdquo; he asserted with a straight
face, &ldquo;the board finds a tendency among both unions and
employers to drop small differences into the board&rsquo;s lap for
settlement rather than seek agreement through negotiations. This
delays the settlement of major issues, since the board refers back to
the parties issues it feels have not been adequately negotiated.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The statement that, &ldquo;both&rdquo; the unions and employers
&ldquo;drop small differences into the board&rsquo;s lap,&rdquo; can
evoke only a big horse-laugh from the workers. The very existence of
the compulsory arbitration board, dominated by the employers and
their &ldquo;public&rdquo; agents, has provided the pretext for the
corporations to brush aside direct negotiations with the unions.</p>

<p>The employers know that without the right to strike the workers
cannot clinch their bargaining power. They know that the WLB was
established to permit the corporations to stall the workers&rsquo;
just demands. And they know that Roosevelt&rsquo;s wage-freezing
policy has bound the WLB to the policy of forbidding wage grants to
the workers.</p>

<p>Of course, the corporations have not hesitated to make the best
possible use of this anti-labor board. As most local union grievance
committees can testify, the moment the board was put into operation,
the bosses answered: every grievance complaint with &ldquo;Take it to
the WLB!&rdquo; The workers were put on a merry-go-round, chasing
back and forth between, the board and the employers.</p>

<p>But suppose the companies and unions did agree beforehand to a
contract? Then the WLB insisted on its &ldquo;right&rdquo; to pass
upon the terms of such a contract. Wage concessions made to the
workers were often and promptly prohibited &ndash; and the board
didn&rsquo;t spend a year or two years coming to a decision.</p>

<p><em>That&rsquo;s what happened in the coal miners case two years
ago. After the union and the operators agreed to a contract, the WLB
intervened to rule the wage concessions a &ldquo;violation&rdquo; of
Roosevelt&rsquo;s &ldquo;wage-stabilization&rdquo; policy. Just a
couple of weeks ago in New York, the WLB stepped in to order a wage
cut for 8,000 pocketbook workers after the manufacturers had granted
bonus and merit increases.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Sheer Hypocrisy</h4>

<p class="fst">What Davis is trying to do with his hypocritical statement is to
whitewash the WLB and refurbish its tattered prestige. The workers
have come to understand its function. They are demanding that the
union representatives withdraw from the board. Davis is seeking to
prop up the board by disclaiming its pro-employer function as an
agency for stalling the workers&rsquo; demands. That is why he tries
to attribute its red- tape to &ldquo;both&rdquo; the workers and
bosses who &ldquo;refuse&rdquo; to negotiate &ldquo;small
grievances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This hypocrisy stands doubly exposed in the light of the most
important wage cases now pending in the WLB. What has held up the
decisions in the packinghouse, auto, textile, glass, aluminum cases?
Some of them have been before the WLB for over two years. Were they
just swamped out by the volume of &ldquo;small grievances&rdquo;
pouring into the board? No, these cases have been deliberately
stalled by the WLB. And when this device became too crude and
obvious, Roosevelt tried to take the heat off his WLB by getting his
Director of Economic Stabilization Vinson to block any WLB wage
decisions.</p>

<p><em>For Davis to pretend that the Board would not continue to stall
grievances if it didn&rsquo;t have so many is as absurd as contending
that a wild tiger devours raw meat not by preference but only because
it can&rsquo;t get fresh vegetables.</em></p>
