<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1945/index.htm#m45_12" target="new">Vol.&#160;IX No.&#160;12</a>, 24 March 1945, pp.&nbsp;1 &amp;&nbsp;4.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">The militant auto workers have run up a smashing 35 per cent vote
for scrapping the No-Strike Pledge in the CIO United Automobile,
Aircraft and Agricultural Implement workers referendum held during
January and February, according to the first unofficial returns
announced by Ben Garrison, referendum committee chairman.</p>

<p>Approximately 300,000 votes were sent in by mail, according to
Garrison, out of 1,200,000 ballots distributed. Over 105,000 were for
rescinding the pledge, while 185,000 voted for it, and some 6,000
ballots were voided.</p>

<p>Neither the corporation daily press nor the top CIO and UAW
officials take the formal majority for the pledge as a victory for
the no-strike policy. On the contrary they correctly view the
tremendous minority vote rolled up for scrapping the pledge as the
true indication of the trend of the ranks.</p>

<p>As <strong>Business Week</strong>, a leading mouthpiece for the
corporations, commented, the UAW leaders are &ldquo;embarrassed in
making the results public. The vote was counted while more men were
on strike in Detroit&rsquo;s auto plants than at any time since the
war began.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vote for smashing the nostrike pledge is particularly
impressive because it was cast in the face of an unprecedented
campaign of pressure and intimidation by a united front of the
corporations and their press, the Roosevelt administration, the
Murray-Hillman machine of the CIO, the entire top UAW leadership and
the Stalinists.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Unholy Alliance</h4>

<p class="fst">All the reactionary forces inside and outside the UAW combined in
an unholy alliance against the auto ranks. The daily press and radio
poured out an endless stream of lies and threats. Roosevelt
intervened personally with a letter to UAW President R.J. Thomas.
Murray issued a special anti-strike edition of the <strong>CIO News</strong>
addressed to the auto workers.</p>

<p>The International Executive Board and top officers of the UAW
unitedly appealed to the membership to retain the pledge. They
mobilized their large machine of paid functionaries throughout the
union on behalf of the pledge. The Stalinists milked the treasuries
of the unions under their control and poured huge sums into the
reactionary drive.</p>

<p>In addition, there were serious irregularities in the conduct of
the referendum. Reports are coming in of large numbers of auto
members who received no ballots. Non-members, including corporation
officials, as in Lansing, Michigan, were the recipients of ballots.</p>

<p>The militant Rank and File Caucus, initiated only six months
before the referendum began, did not have sufficient time,
organization or resources to reach a large section of the members.
Nevertheless, in the face of tremendous obstacles, it mobilized a
powerful minority vote against the pledge.</p>

<p>Events in the past month since the completion of the referendum
confirm the real significance of the vote to rescind. The UAW
executive board has been compelled to call for withdrawing the CIO
members from the WLB. The corporations have launched a savage
offensive against the unions. Over 60,000 auto workers have hit the
picket lines in Detroit in the past five weeks.</p>

<p><em>These events fallowing the referendum vote indicate the
fighting mood of the ranks. They disclose the substantial base that
exists for a powerful caucus that will lead a showdown fight for a
militant program and a new, aggressive leadership. The task ahead for
the Rank and File Caucus is to make serious, organized preparations
to extend and strengthen its forces in the ranks for the coming
inevitable battle to reestablish the UAW-CIO as the vanguard union in
the American labor struggle.</em></p>
