<h4>U.S. Steel Contract</h4>

<p class="fst">A &ldquo;model&rdquo; agreement containing no major improvements
over previous contracts, and, of course, none of the basic wage
demands of the steelworkers, was finally signed last week between the
CIO Steelworkers Union and the United States Steel Corporation,
leading steel trust. Five U.S. Steel subsidiaries signed the contract
which is expected to be the pattern for the rest of the industry.</p>

<p>The contract includes the so-called &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; demands
granted by the WLB at the time it turned down all the major demands
of the union after stalling the steel wage case for over a year. This
includes a four to six cents an hour premium for the two night
shifts, one week&rsquo;s vacation with pay for service up to 5 years,
and some dismissal or severance pay. None of these concessions,
however, are up to the Standards customarily maintained in the best
organized industries.</p>

<p>The big &ldquo;selling&rdquo; point of the contract for the union
leaders is a clause providing for a permanent three-man arbitration
board with power to make binding decisions in disputes arising over
application of the contract. This board, the usual &ldquo;impartial&rdquo;
body selected by agreement of company and union officials, is hailed
by the union officials as &ldquo;a momentous advance in management-
union relations.&rdquo; It is actually nothing more than an
additional means for stalling the workers&rsquo; demands and keeping
them from taking independent action to enforce the contract. The
previous contract provided for such a board only on a temporary basis
from case to case.</p>

<p>CIO Steelworkers President Philip Murray crowed about a &ldquo;great
victory&rdquo; when the WLB turned down the union&rsquo;s basic
demands. The tightening of compulsory arbitration is now hailed as a
&ldquo;great advance.&rdquo; A few more such &ldquo;great victories&rdquo;
and &ldquo;great advances&rdquo; and the steel workers will find
themselves completely at the mercy of the corporations and back to
their previous low level of living conditions.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<a id="p2"></a>
<h4>Army and Ward &lsquo;Seizure&rsquo;</h4>

<p class="fst">Army officials in charge of operating units of Montgomery Ward
&ldquo;seized&rdquo; by the government to halt strikes provoked by
WLB delay in enforcing its orders against the company, last week
relinquished control over the two main units, the warehouse and
mail-order house in Chicago. These are the central purchasing and
distributing agencies for Ward&rsquo;s 650 outlets, including the 13
now under Army control.</p>

<p>By a fancy method of bookkeeping, the government was debited with
purchases of merchandise to stock the &ldquo;seized&rdquo; retail
outlets while all sales receipts were turned over to the company.
This meant that the government was constantly going &ldquo;into the
red&rdquo; &ndash; everything going out, nothing coming in.</p>

<p>Naturally, the government, which is loathe to infringe upon
&ldquo;private property rights,&rdquo; has found it almost impossible
to operate the tiny segment of Ward&rsquo;s under its control while
the vast structure of the company remains in the control of Sewell
Avery.</p>

<p>The recent federal district court decision declaring the &ldquo;seizure&rdquo;
illegal gave the Army officials sufficient pretext for gradually
withdrawing from their uncomfortable position of having to enforce
WLB orders against an open-shop employer whose antilabor views
generally coincide with their own. Thus, Sewell Avery is still
successfully refusing to obey the WLB rulings after years of
defiance.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<h4>Auto Barons Assail UAW</h4>

<p class="fst">Charges of deliberate company provocations leading to numerous
strikes in the auto industry made by CIO United Automobile Workers
Secretary-Treasurer George Addes in a statement before the Senate War
Investigating Committee have brought a counter-attack from the
automotive barons.</p>

<p>Trying to cover up for the companies which have been emboldened to
ever greater anti-union acts by the continuance of the no-strike
policy, George Romney, managing .director of the Automotive Council
for War Production, last week howled that the strikes are part of a
scheme to &ldquo;usurp management&rsquo;s functions and
responsibilities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While Mr. Addes and other leaders feign a pious public
attitude and pretend they do not want to control production, their
union representatives in the plants are trying to muscle in on
management for the greater aggrandizement of labor monopoly,&rdquo;
proclaimed Mr. Romney.</p>

<p>This is not a new argument. The auto corporations fought unionism
in the industry from its earliest beginning by claiming that the
unions intend to infringe on their &ldquo;god-given&rdquo;
prerogatives to control production and boot the workers around any
way they see fit. So far as the bosses are concerned, any attempt of
the workers to have something to say about their conditions of work
is &ldquo;usurpation&rdquo; of the &ldquo;rights of management.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Besides, what&rsquo;s wrong with the idea of the organized workers
assuming the whole function of capitalist management? The capitalists
are only profiteering parasites and a brake upon production&rsquo;.
Guaranteed job security and uninterrupted production will be achieved
only when the automotive and other basic industries are taken over by
the government and operated under workers&rsquo; control.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<a id="p4"></a>
<h4>CIO Newspaper Guild and Bridges</h4>

<p class="fst">When Milton Murray, President of the CIO Newspaper Guild and
reporter for the New York daily <strong>PM</strong>, exposed the Stalinist &ldquo;traitors&rsquo;
lobby&rdquo; in, the CIO which secretly approached Congressmen urging
them to vote for the May-Bailey slave labor bill, he did a service to
the labor movement.</p>

<p>But he makes a mistake when he. permits his justified and
understandable contempt for the Stalinist traitors to influence his
position on the question of the government&rsquo;s attempt to deport
Harry Bridges, Stalinist leader of the CIO Longshoremen&rsquo;s
Union. Last week Murray and the Guild executive board turned down a
resolution of protest against the Bridges deportation proceedings on
the grounds that Bridges is a &ldquo;misleader of labor&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;quisling in our ranks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everything the Newspaper Guild says about Bridges as a treacherous
union leader is true. But neither the government nor the employers
are attacking him for that reason. In fact, they praise his pi&raquo;sent
policies. They instituted proceedings against Bridges because he is a
union leader who is a non-citizen and once held radical views. His
deportation could then be used as a precedent to harass and victimize
other militant union leaders.</p>

<p>The job of eliminating elements like Bridges from the labor
movement cannot be handed over to the capitalist government, whose
motives are entirely anti-labor. That job belongs solely to the
organized workers themselves, who need to rid the unions of the
Stalinist blight in order to strengthen and protect their
organizations against such employer and government attacks.</p>
