<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1945/index.htm#m45_11" target="new">Vol.&#160;IX No.&#160;11</a>, 17 March 1945, p.&nbsp;4.<br />

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="fst">Earl Browder&rsquo;s strikebreaking Communist (Stalinist)
Political Association recently published a pamphlet entitled the
<strong>Trotskyite 5th Column in the Labor Movement</strong>, written by the
<strong>Daily Worker</strong>&rsquo;s specialist in anti-Trotskyist
red-baiting. George Morris. It is being distributed wholesale,
especially in Minnesota where the Trotskyists won great renown as the
organizers and leaders of the famous Northwest drivers movement.</p>

<p>This latest anti-Trotskyist stink-bomb, as its title indicates,
compiles all the lies and slanders previously peddled against the
Trotskyists and the militant labor movement generally, with some new
poison-pen inventions for good measure.</p>

<p>Why have the Stalinists issued this pamphlet and intensified their
ferocious slander campaign at this time?<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Stalinist Motives</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>The Stalinists have sold their services to American Big
Business, its government and chief political agent Roosevelt, as part
payment for the diplomatic and military accord between American
imperialism and the Kremlin bureaucracy. They are frantically
endeavoring to convince Wall Street that they can be its most
reliable' tools within the labor movement.</em></p>

<p>This traitor&rsquo;s chore has become increasingly difficult
because the worker&rsquo;s resentment against the imperialist war and
its consequences, particularly the antilabor policies of the
Roosevelt administration, grows fiercer each day.</p>

<p>With the growth of this resentment, the ideas and program of the
Socialist Workers Party appear more clearly as the only answer to the
workers&rsquo; problems. For the Trotskyists represent the only
serious political opposition within the working class to the
labor-hating capitalists, their government and imperialist war
program.</p>

<p>The Trotskyist prestige, moreover, has been tremendously enhanced
as a consequence of the Minneapolis Labor Case frame-up in which
Roosevelt railroaded to prison 18 leaders and outstanding trade
unionists of the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party who refused to
surrender their socialist principles or to suspend their fight in
defense of the workers&rsquo; interests.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Attack All Militants</h4>

<p class="fst">Now that the Trotskyist leaders have been released from prison,
the Stalinists are more than ever alarmed and fearful. They are
hysterically attempting to counteract the growing influence of the
ideas and program of Trotskyism and the widespread working-class
admiration for the courageous stand of the Trotskyists. This has been
especially evidenced by the support given the imprisoned Trotskyists
by over 600 labor unions, representing more than 4,500,000 workers.</p>

<p><em>Morris even has the audacity to present as his chief witness
against the Trotskyists the AFL Teamsters Czar, Daniel J. Tobin, who
inspired the frameup of the 18 Trotskyist leaders. Tobin last week
further distinguished himself as the only high union official to
openly advocate continuation and enforcement of Roosevelt&rsquo;s
wage-freezing Little Steel formula.</em></p>

<p>The Stalinist attack is directed not only against the Trotskyists
as the most conscious vanguard of the working class, but at every
militant endeavor of the workers to better their conditions and
defend themselves against the union-busting offensive of the
corporations.</p>

<p>This is shown by the pamphlet&rsquo;s emphasis on the particular
aspects of the Trotskyist program which coincide with the militant
sentiments of increasing numbers of American workers. The
Trotskyists, Morris complains, want to &ldquo;smash the no-strike
pledge,&rdquo; &ldquo;sneer at joint labor-management committees as
&lsquo;speed-up&rsquo; instruments,&rdquo; condemn the War Labor
Board. They &ldquo;shout loudly that management and labor cannot
possibly have joint interests&rdquo; and are &ldquo;guided by a
conviction that a new and sharp depression will follow the end of
hostilities.&rdquo; And &ndash; imagine! &ndash; the Trotskyists are
even the leading proponents of an independent labor party. It is
these ideas, ideas to which millions of the best unionists are
becoming sympathetic, which Morris tries to smear as &ldquo;fascist.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Unholy Alliance</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>But the agents of Stalin are seeking to bridle not only the
American workers. They are also aiding the Anglo-American
imperialists to suppress the war- weary masses of Europe who are
beginning to rise in revolutionary wrath against the capitalist
war-makers and their system of exploitation. Today, in any country
where the workers engage in independent struggle against their
oppressive overlords, capitalist reaction labels them as
&ldquo;Trotskyites&rdquo; and foully slanders the revolutionary
workers who are the chief victims of fascism, as &ldquo;agents of
Hitler.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Thus, the most appropriate name Churchill could think of for the
Greek workers whom the Allied troops had massacred was &ldquo;Trotskyites.&rdquo;
He claimed they were &ldquo;worse than the Nazis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Churchill joins the chorus of the Stalinists who perfected this
technique in the Moscow trials. These frameups were organized by
Stalin&rsquo;s secret police, the GPU, to discredit and falsify the
real ideas of Bolshevism and to smear the genuine Marxist
revolutionists as &ldquo;Hitler agents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This latest scurrilous Stalinist pamphlet is therefore part of a
worldwide campaign by the Allied imperialists and Stalin against the
developing working- class upsurge and the predestined Trotskyist
leadership of this revolutionary struggle.</p>

<p>To this end Morris spreads the infamous lie that the &ldquo;Trotskyite
Fourth International is shaping into a Nazi instrument.&rdquo; To
mention no other fact, this malicious invention is shattered by the
report from France, published only last week in <strong>The Militant</strong>,
which lists the names, dates and places of the imprisonment and
executions of hundreds of Trotskyist fighters &ndash; French, German,
Greek, Belgian &ndash; at the hands of the murderous Nazis.</p>

<p><em>Morris concludes with the threat that anyone associating with
Trotskyists will be accused of &ldquo;consorting with the enemy.&rdquo;
But workers who know the score are not likely to be fooled or
intimidated by such threats or slanders. For they can see with their
own eyes that it is the Stalinists who today join with the
profiteering capitalists, the real enemies of labor, in every attack
on the workers. The Stalinists advocate the permanent no-strike
pledge. They support Roosevelt&rsquo;s slave labor demand. The
workers are fast learning that the Stalinists themselves are the most
cunning and sinister agents of Wall Street within the labor movement.</em></p>
