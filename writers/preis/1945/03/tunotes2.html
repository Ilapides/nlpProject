<h4>Murray &ldquo;Fights&rdquo; Back</h4>

<p class="fst">CIO President Philip &ldquo;Bleeding Heart&rdquo; Murray greeted
the WLB&rsquo;s approval of the Little Steel Formula with his typical
blustering display of verbal indignation.</p>

<p>Murray, who has been beating his gums for a couple of years about
the &ldquo;inequity of the Little Steel Formula&rdquo; While doing
all in his power to curb any independent action of the CIO workers to
smash the formula, declaimed that &ldquo;the situation in which labor
now finds itself is simply intolerable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his very next sentence, however he proposes to continue the
very union policy that has brought labor to this &ldquo;intolerable
situation.&rdquo; He declares: &ldquo;Now, more than ever, it is of
the utmost importance to our war effort that there be maintained
uninterrupted production. The CIO and its members are fully conscious
of this need and therefore shall observe their no-strike pledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Murray believes in the policy of &ldquo;turning the other
cheek&rdquo; &ndash; only it&rsquo;s the workers who always get
slapped. But not forever and not for long. The CIO members are
becoming &ldquo;fully conscious&rdquo; of the need, not to &ldquo;observe
the no-strike pledge,&rdquo; but to scrap it. That&rsquo;s the
significance of the Textile Union&rsquo;s revocation of the no-strike
pledge for 100,000 cotton-rayon workers and the growing strike wave
in Detroit.</em></p>

<p>Incidentally, it is appropriate to recall how Murray helped disarm
the workers about the WLB and its position on the Little Steel
Formula. In his appeal for continuation of the no-strike pledge
before the rebellious delegates at the CIO. United Automobile Workers
convention last September, Murray asserted &ldquo;I am just as sure
as I am living that the Little Steel Formula is going to be revised.
I don&rsquo;t think I would be far from correct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that time Murray demanded support for the no-strike policy
because he claimed the Little Steel Formula was sure to be revised.
Now he insists on the same policy because the formula hasn&rsquo;t
been revised. The one thing Murray is sure of is that no matter how
the workers are kicked around, they must not fight back with their
most effective weapon, the strike.</p>

<h4>Telephone Pay</h4>

<p class="fst">Reversing the recommendation of a $5 a week increase made by its
own special panel, the WLB in Washington last week granted increases
of only $3 to the local and long distance telephone operators in New
York City who overwhelmingly voted to strike in January but postponed
a final strike vote under the Smith-Connally act pending a ruling of
the national WLB. Washington, D.C. operators who participated in the
Thanksgiving week strike along with Ohio and Michigan workers were
awarded a $4 increase. Louisville and Memphis operators were granted
$3.</p>

<p><em>The New York operators were induced to call off their strike in
January, when the American Telephone and Telegraph and New York
Telephone companies hastily made an offer to pay $4 a week more. This
was $1 less than the Federation of Long Lines Telephone Workers and
the Traffic Employees Association (local operators) were demanding.
The unions continued to press for their original demands before the
WLB.</em></p>

<p>Union representatives have declared they are going to petition the
WLB for a reconsideration of the case in an effort to secure the $4
raise the companies agreed to pay. If the petition is rejected
another strike vote will very likely be taken. The telephone workers
are particularly indignant because the WLB made its decision without
giving the unions a public hearing.</p>

<p>WLB Vice-Chairman Taylor conceded that a &ldquo;mistake may have
been made&rdquo; by the failure to hold such a hearing. However, it
is always the corporations and never the workers who benefit by such
&ldquo;mistakes.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<a id="p3"></a>
<h4>Unionism Grows</h4>

<p class="fst">During the past year, according to the annual National Labor
Relations Board report, 1,072,694 unorganized workers voted in NLRB
elections for union collective bargaining representation. This brings
the nine year total to 5,220,983.</p>

<p>The number voting last year was the greatest in the NLRB&rsquo;s
history, and the number of elections held registered &ldquo;an
increase of 3,000 per cent over the number received in the first year
of the board&rsquo;s operations.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Despite all the anti-labor propaganda, the workers in the past
year voted union in greater numbers than ever before.</em></p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<a id="p4"></a>
<h4>55-Cent Minimum IF &mdash;</h4>

<p class="fst">After issuing its decision &ldquo;recommending&rdquo; a 55-cent an
hour minimum wage in the textile case, the War Labor Board last week
granted its regional agencies authority to approve a minimum wage up
to 55 cents for all &ldquo;substandard&rdquo; wage earners,
admittedly numbering over 4,000,000.</p>

<p><em>However, WLB Chairman Davis hastened to assure a press
Conference that &ldquo;this action by the board does not mean,
unfortunately, that 4,000,000 workers are going to get a 55-cent wage
tomorrow.&rdquo; All it does is merely &ldquo;open the way for the
workers to get that amount.&rdquo; In short, they&rsquo;ll get it if
they raise enough hell!</em></p>

<p>The ruling has the usual loopholes enabling the administration to
deny in practice what it grants in principle. The workers can secure
a 55-cent minimum IF &mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li>the employers agree to it and request it;</li>

<li>no price increase is involved;</li>

<li>an increase to the new minimum does not conflict with the
&ldquo;appropriate prevailing rates&rdquo; in given areas and
communities.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">The administration&rsquo;s intent in making this new ruling is far
from benevolent. Its purpose is to take the curse off the WLB&rsquo;s
prior &ldquo;recommendation&rdquo; upholding continuation of the
wage-freezing Little Steel Formula. In addition, the administration
is seeking to head off growing union pressure for passage of the
Pepper resolution which would fix the minimum hourly wage at 65
cents. The labor members of the WLB had proposed a 72-cent minimum,
basing their demand upon the government&rsquo;s own figures for a
minimum health and decency income required by the average worker&rsquo;s
family.</p>

<p><em>Even when the pro-corporation WLB does make a seeming
concession to the workers, it is so full of &ldquo;if, ands, and
buts&rdquo; that the workers can generally expect to get &ldquo;nothin&rsquo;
for nothin&rsquo; and damn little of that.&rdquo;</em></p>
