<h4>UAW Convention</h4>

<p class="fst">The CIO United Automobile Workers, whose annual conventions always
make labor history, faces difficulty in holding a convention this
year because of the government ban on conventions not in the interest
of the war effort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>George Addes, UAW-CIO Secretary-Treasurer, has filed a request
with the War Committee on Conventions for authorization of the
union&rsquo;s convention next September 10 at Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p>

<p>His petition stated:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Only through such a convention can there be
achieved the unity and cohesion necessary for sound planning,
discipline and the establishment of peaceful labor relations making
for continuity of production and full participation by the workers in
the war effort.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>At the 1942 and 1943 UAW conventions, however, Addes and the
other top leaders tried to push over resolutions to suspend the
annual conventions &ldquo;for the duration&rdquo; because they
claimed conventions &ldquo;interfered with full participation by the
workers in the war effort.&rdquo; The real motive, of course, was to
prevent the rank and file conventions from &ldquo;interfering&rdquo;
with the bureaucratic designs of the leadership.</em></p>

<p>So the UAW ranks had better be on the alert for a fast move to
block their convention &ndash; with the government carrying the ball
for the UAW leaders, who took a terrific shellacking at the last
convention when the rank-and- file delegates almost defeated the
no-strike policy.</p>

<h4>Quislings in Labor</h4>

<p class="fst">The March 15 <strong>Justice</strong>, organ of the AFL International Ladies
Garment Workers Union, publishes a slashing denunciation of the
Stalinist leaders of the Greater New York CIO Council for their
resolution which attacked the United Mine Workers Union in the
current UMWA contract negotiations. The Stalinists called for
government &ldquo;seizure&rdquo; of the mines to prevent a &ldquo;strike
plot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Entitled <em>Quislings In Labor</em>, the editorial points out that
the &ldquo;miners&rsquo; demands, viewed in their entirety, are quite
moderate.&rdquo; It states that both the ILGWU and the CIO
Amalgamated Clothing Workers have long enjoyed contract provisions
for a &ldquo;royalty&rdquo; on pay polls to provide a union welfare
fund similar to what the miners are now demanding. It further
concedes that &lsquo;&ldquo;any other union under similar
circumstances, doubtless, would have performed the same gesture&rdquo;
of filing a formal 30-day strike notice under the Smith-Connally Act
provisions.</p>

<p>It is against this background that tho Stalinists made their
anti-miners attack, described by <strong>Justice</strong> &ldquo;as dastardly a
piece of sabotage as has disgraced the American labor scene within
recent memory.&rdquo; <strong>Justice</strong> charges the resolution of the
Stalinists spoke &ldquo;in the language even a Girdler or a Weir
would have hesitated to use&rdquo; and provides &ldquo;generous moral
support to the mine operators.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;We are just wondering,&rdquo; concludes the
editorial, &ldquo;how Philip Murray, himself a coal miner and for
thirty years intimately linked with the woes and struggles of the
coal miners, feels about this latest quisling job perpetrated by some
of his New York associates on his own lifelong fellow-unionists.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h4>Avery Carries On</h4>

<p class="fst">Roosevelt&rsquo;s army &ldquo;seizure&rdquo; of a tiny fraction of
Montgomery Ward&rsquo;s vast mercantile network didn't interfere with
the company&rsquo;s profits, although the CIO unions are still
without a contract after the &ldquo;seizure&rdquo; broke their
strikes.</p>

<p>Sewell Avery, chairman of the company&rsquo;s board and leading
open-shopper, announced last week that &ldquo;all divisions of the
business operated profitably for the year.&rdquo; He reported
$21,285,839 net profits for the year ending January 31, 1945, as
compared to $20,677,098 for the previous year.</p>

<p>After the army &ldquo;seizure&rdquo; last December 27 &ndash; an
action since ruled illegal by the Chicago Federal District Court &ndash;
&ldquo;the Army by Jan. 31 had paid from its own funds $2,306,474.36
more than it had appropriated&rdquo; from cash on hand and sales
according to Avery. The army had a tough time operating, due to the
refusal of the Ward officials to cooperate. But the brass hats made
sure that the company didn&rsquo;t go into the &ldquo;red,&rdquo;
even to the extent of making up losses with government funds.</p>

<p><em>The Army however has not enforced the WLB decisions whose
rejection by the company led to the strikes and the &ldquo;seizure.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h4>Terror at Weirton</h4>

<p class="fst">A long string of former employees of the Weirton Steel Company,
which has successfully resisted unionization by the CIO Steelworkers
since 1936, last week testified to the ruthless physical terrorism,
intimidation and illegal firings for union membership that has
prevailed at the company&rsquo;s plants.</p>

<p>The hearings were being held before a special master of the Third
Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in contempt proceedings against the
company filed by the National Labor Relations Board. The NLRB charges
the company with refusal to abide by the board&rsquo;s orders not to
interfere with the union, and specifically accuses Weirton with
maintaining a company union in violation of a federal court order of
1943.</p>

<p>Actually, the case goes back to 1936! Through slick legal
maneuvering, delaying tactics and the assistance of hair-splitting
judges, the company stalled off a decision for seven years until
October 1943. The company then filed a lengthy and complicated &ldquo;bill
of exceptions.&rdquo; The present hearings were petitioned last
August.</p>

<p>By these means, it will be possible for the company to string the
case out for another seven years. This is a further illustration of
the futility of the workers relying on the capitalist courts for
justice. The workers have only one reliable weapon &ndash; their own
independent organized strength in action.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Shipyard Layoffs</h4>

<p class="fst">Henry J. Kaiser, shipyard tycoon who is proclaimed an industrial
&ldquo;genius&rdquo; for his capacity to get tremendous government
handouts, recently admitted to a press conference that the
government&rsquo;s shipbuilding program may wind up within a year.
Over a million shipyard workers face mass unemployment.</p>

<p><em>Since November 1943, when private shipyard employment hit a
peak of 1,293,000, the number of shipyard workers has declined to
1,035,000 in January 1945. The rate of decline has increased since
the first of the year with a steady decrease in production schedules.</em></p>
