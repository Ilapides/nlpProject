<h4>Textile Strike Poll</h4>

<p class="fst">Without one dissenting vote some 50,000 New England cotton-rayon
textile workers last week in a poll conducted by the CIO Textile
Workers Union empowered the TWU officers to demand an NLRB strike
vote under the Smith-Connally anti-strike law provisions.</p>

<p>In Fall River, Mass., 3,500 union members went even further. They
empowered the TWU leaders to call a strike without going through the
formality of a government-supervised election and an additional
30-day stalling period.</p>

<p><em>The TWU executive board several weeks ago revoked the no-strike
pledge for 100,000 cotton- rayon workers. They acted after a
long-delayed WLB decision granting &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; increases and
raising the minimum wage from 50 cents to 55 cents an hour was
blocked by Roosevelt&rsquo;s former Economic Stabilization Director
Vinson. TWU President Emil Rieve at the same time resigned from the
WLB.</em></p>

<p>An editorial on <em>The No-Strike Pledge</em> in the March <strong>Textile
Labor</strong>, official organ of the TWU-CIO, explains why the union
scrapped the pledge. After describing the
administration-manufacturers conspiracy to deprive the exploited
textile workers of their just demands, the editorial says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;While all this was going on, no attempt was made
to &lsquo;stabilize&rsquo; cotton manufacturers&rsquo; profits, which
were continuing at the rate of $365,000,000 a year, five times
pre-war figures ... But there are other considerations back of the
action ... Nearly 100,000 TWUA members are now in the armed forces.
Are they to come back to $24 a week wages? Are they fighting for
another chance to be ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed? If we do not
fight their home-front battles for them, if we capitulate to
reaction, what else can they come home to?&rdquo;</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<h4>UAW Dues Decline</h4>

<p class="fst">Dues-paying membership in the CIO United Automobile, Aircraft and
Agricultural Implement Workers, largest union in the country,
declined by 113,741 during the period between May and November 1944
according to the latest report of UAW Secretary-Treasurer George
Addes.</p>

<p><em>The monthly average of dues-paying members during the reported
period was 1,008,159. Over half the membership is in Michigan, with
528,429 members, 345,127 of them concentrated in Detroit.</em></p>

<p>A primary reason for the sharp membership decline &ndash; over 10
per cent within six months &ndash; is unemployment due to cut-backs
and layoffs, despite the Roosevelt administration&rsquo;s claims of a
&ldquo;labor shortage&rdquo; to bolster its demand for a forced labor
bill.</p>

<p>Unemployment compensation claims since December 1, 1944 in
Michigan have been averaging between 18,000 and 20,000 weekly.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<a id="p3"></a>
<h4>Hush-Hush in Auto</h4>

<p class="fst">Every newspaper from coast to coast headlined the great strike
wave the past few weeks in Detroit. During a period of three weeks
some 60,000 auto workers, the greatest number since Pearl Harbor, hit
the picket lines to defend their unions against the union-busting
provocations of the corporations.</p>

<p>A microscopic examination of the <strong>United Automobile Worker</strong>,
official organ of the UAW-CIO, for the past two issues, March 1 and
15, reveals not a word about this tremendous development of such
importance and interest not only to the auto workers but to the whole
labor movement. There is not even a line in protest against the open,
savage, concerted campaign of the corporations to break the unions by
wholesale firing of local union officers, committeemen and shop
stewards.</p>

<p><em>During the recently concluded UAW referendum on the no-strike
pledge, the UAW top officials did not hesitate to use the union&rsquo;s
paper, in violation of a convention mandate, to plug for the nostrike
pledge by printing whole pages of CIO President Philip Murray&rsquo;s
anti-strike speeches under the heading of &ldquo;news.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>But when the auto rank and file themselves make real news by
militant defense of their unions, the UAW leaders stupidly try to
play ostrich. They soft-peddle the struggle and bureaucratically
deprive the membership of the aid of their own paper.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<h4>AFL Asks 11% Boost</h4>

<p class="fst">The AFL, through its members on the War Labor Board, answered the
WLB&rsquo;s endorsement of the wage-freezing Little Steel Formula by
petitioning Roosevelt with a demand for a general immediate 11 per
cent wage increase.</p>

<p>This petition refutes the lying &ldquo;statistics&rdquo; of the
WLB &ldquo;public&rdquo; members about wages rising &ldquo;faster&rdquo;
than the cost of living.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Since the war wage rates have increased by 19 per
cent,&rdquo; the AFL representatives pointed out, &ldquo;while the
cost of living has increased &ndash; based upon official figures &ndash;
by 30 per cent. To correct the maladjustment between wages and the
cost of living &ndash; when measured by the same standard that was
used when the Little Steel Formula was adopted &ndash; an adjustment
of approximately 11 per cent is justified.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The only thing wrong with the AFL&rsquo;s demand is that it gives
away too much to the government and employers. The government&rsquo;s
cost-of-living figures are as phony as a nine-dollar hill. The cost
of living has gone up nearer to 50 per cent than 30. On this real
basis, labor is justified in demanding not an 11 per cent but a 30
per cent wage boost.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<a id="p5"></a>
<h4>Philadelphia Aftermath</h4>

<p class="fst">Twenty-seven company-union members and leaders of the Philadelphia
transit walkout last August against the upgrading of Negro workers
took the rap in federal court last week for the company-inspired
action. They were each fined $100 under the Smith-Connally Act after
reversing their not guilty pleas to no defense.</p>

<p>Among the questions the court failed to answer were these. Why was
the Jim-Crow stoppage organized on company property and strike
meetings freely held there? What company officials advised the
workers to initiate the walkout by getting &ldquo;sick&rdquo; in a
body in order to prevent the use of Negro workers as motormen and
conductors? Why was the walkout organized by leaders of the PRT
(Philadelphia Rapid Transit) Employees Union, the old company union,
just after it had been defeated by the CIO for collective bargaining
representative? Why did the company say not a word against the
walkout &ndash; aiding it by cutting off the subway power?</p>

<p><em>One defense attorney bluntly declared:</em></p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;The race question was dragged in by officials
of PTC (Philadelphia Transportation Co.). They were out to smash the
bridgehead that organized labor has finally succeeded in holding in
PTC.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">A hand-picked grand jury which brought down the original
indictments against the misled workers who were made the scapegoats
of this affair simply covered up for the company and turned the
proceedings into an attack on the CIO and a defense of company
unionism.</p>
