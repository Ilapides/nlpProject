<h4>Treason to Labor</h4>

<p class="fst">Daniel J. Tobin, AFL Teamsters&rsquo; Czar and initiator of the
Minneapolis Case frameup, has maintained himself in the forefront of
the labor traitors by endorsing the wage-freezing Little Steel
Formula through an editorial in the March <strong>International Teamster</strong>,
the personal organ he operates in the name of the union.</p>

<p><em>Tobin&rsquo;s mouthpiece spouts that &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t
scrap the Little Steel Formula without scrapping the entire
stabilization program.&rdquo; It moans that politicians and
profiteers who &ldquo;want to see all economic controls removed&rdquo;
are &ldquo;encouraging some labor leaders to break the Little Steel
Formula&rdquo; and advises that &ldquo;labor better do some serious
thinking&rdquo; before attacking Roosevelt&rsquo;s wage-freezing
formula.</em></p>

<p>Evidently, Tobin was subsequently quickly apprised of the fact
that labor has already done &ldquo;some serious thinking.&rdquo; The
workers think that the Little Steel Formula was designed by the
corporations and Roosevelt to put the squeeze on labor while
protecting the war-profiteers. At any rate, Tobin issued a hasty
&ldquo;repudiation&rdquo; of the editorial, claiming it had &ldquo;escaped&rdquo;
his attention before publication.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<h4>Knifing the Miners</h4>

<p class="fst">The same Stalinists in the New York CIO who secretly lobbied for
Congressional endorsement of the May-Bailey slave labor bill have
tried to stick a knife in the nation&rsquo;s mine workers at the
opening of the United Mine Worker contract negotiations. At a
shop-stewards meeting of the Stalinist-dominated Greater New York CIO
Council, the finky leadership shoved through a resolution calling on
Roosevelt to &ldquo;seize&rdquo; the mines because of an alleged
&ldquo;strike threat&rdquo; by John L. Lewis.</p>

<p>Singing the tune of the most vicious labor-haters, the Stalinist
resolution charged the Mine Union leaders with a &ldquo;strike plot
against the nation&rdquo; and called on &ldquo;every citizen&rdquo;
to &ldquo;denounce and defeat the sabotage of John L. Lewis.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>This anti-labor action was denounced last week by Martin Gerber
and Charles H. Kerrigan, eastern regional directors of the powerful
CIO United Automobile Workers, at the UAW executive board meeting in
New York. Gerber stated:</em></p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;I am not a follower of John L. Lewis, but I
support the legitimate wage demands of any groups of American
workers. The miners should not be sabotaged by any organization and
when they are sabotaged by a CIO Council, as was done by the New York
Council, I feel ashamed.&rdquo; Kerrigan observed: &ldquo;Apparently
some elements think unconditional surrender means unconditional
surrender by labor.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<a id="p3"></a>
<h4>Phone Strike Vote</h4>

<p class="fst">A huge overflow joint mass meeting of New York City&rsquo;s
organized local and long distance telephone operators last week voted
unanimously to file a 30-day strike notice with the NLRB. This vote
followed a WLB decision granting only a $3 weekly wage increase after
the telephone companies agreed to $4 and a special WLB panel
recommended the full $5 demanded by the unions.</p>

<p>So aroused were the members of Local 101, Federation of Long Lines
Telephone Operators, and the local New York Telephone Traffic
Employees Association, that the leaders had difficulty persuading the
workers not to strike immediately, but to follow the procedure under
the Smith-Connally Anti-Strike Act. Many militant young women
operators took the floor amid cheers and applause to urge &ldquo;an
immediate strike, starting right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>These operators, who are making wages as low as $20 a week, had
been stalled by the WLB for over 2 years. They evidently mean
business. The WLB has announced that it will render a decision this
week on the petition of the unions for a reconsideration of its $3
wage award.</em></p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<a id="p4"></a>
<h4>Textile Strike Vote</h4>

<p class="fst">Over 100,000 cotton-rayon textile workers, member of the CIO
Textile Workers Union, will take a strike vote in 150 Southern mills
on March 18. The announcement of this largest strike vote of any CIO
union during the war was made by Emil Rieve, the TWU&rsquo;s
international president, on March 8.</p>

<p>This is a sequel to the recent decision of the TWU Executive
Council revoking the no-strike pledge for this large section of the
exploited textile workers, and the resignation of Rieve from the WLB.
The WLB after 19 month&rsquo;s of stalling released &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo;
&ndash; not yet approved by the Economic Stabilization Administration
&ndash; granting meager &ldquo;fringe&rdquo; increases and a 55&cent; an
hour minimum wage. The union had demanded a 10&cent; hourly general wage
increase and a 65&cent; minimum wage.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<a id="p5"></a>
<h4>Lockout in Detroit</h4>

<p class="fst">The latest union-busting corporation provocation against UAW
locals in Detroit is the firing of 35 officers and shop stewards and
the &ldquo;disciplinary&rdquo; layoff for one week of 140 workers, at
the Thompson Products plant for alleged responsibility for a strike
10 days previously. Thompson Products is headed by Frederick
Crawford, former President of the National Association of
Manufacturers and a leading open-shopper.</p>

<p><em>The UAW-CIO international executive board, meeting in New York,
when informed of this move to smash the Thompson Products Detroit
local, declared the firings and lay-offs a lockout by the company and
stated that unless all workers are reinstated plant operations will
not be resumed. The board also called on Roosevelt to &ldquo;seize&rdquo;
the plant.</em></p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<a id="p6"></a>
<h4>Where Was PAC?</h4>

<p class="fst">The lead editorial in the February 28 <strong>Midwest Labor World</strong>,
official organ of the St. Louis Joint Council, United Retail,
Wholesale and Department Store Employees, CIO, asks the question
&ldquo;WHERE WAS PAC?&rdquo; during the height of the Roosevelt-brass
hat campaign to put over the forced labor bill.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;There is a phase to the labor draft fight that
will surprise many workers. It is a fact that up to the time this was
written, after weeks of struggle in Congress by CIO, AFL, the miners
and the railroad brotherhoods, PAC &ndash; the political arm of CIO &ndash;
was silent. They have money, organization and paid spokesmen. Why
weren&rsquo;t they used? The millions of workers who supported PAC
with their dollars are due an explanation of why the bureaucrats of
this organization sat on their expensive hind ends when labor&rsquo;s
liberties were at stake.&rdquo;</p>
