<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1945/index.htm#m45_12" target="new">Vol.&#160;IX No.&#160;12</a>, 24 March 1945, p.&nbsp;1.<br />

<p class="fst">Sitting comfortably atop the greatest pile of profits in their
history, the country&rsquo;s soft coal mine operators last week
flatly rejected six of the nine wage demands of the United Mine
Workers of America and contemptuously countered with an offer of a
few crumbs amounting to 28 cents a day increase.</p>

<p>The UMW&rsquo;s 200-man policy committee promptly instructed the
union&rsquo;s negotiating committee to reject outright the operators&rsquo;
counter-offers and to continue negotiations on the basis of the
original 18 demands made by the miners at the opening of the new
contract parley. The UMW&rsquo;s wage increase demands, carefully
designed to avoid conflict with the formal restrictions of the Little
Steel Formula, are estimated to total over $1.60 a day.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Strike Vote</h4>

<p class="fst">If the present contract terminates within two weeks, on March 31,
without an extension of the old contract or a new agreement being
reached, the over 425,000 soft coal miners may resort to their
traditional policy of &ldquo;no contract, no work.&rdquo; The NLRB,
in response to the miners&rsquo; petition under the Smith-Connally
anti-strike law, has announced that it will conduct a nationwide
strike vote on March 28.</p>

<p><em>How the militant miners will vote is a foregone conclusion, as
their whole past record demonstrates. In the first sampling of
opinion among West Virginia&rsquo;s 100,000 miners, 300 officials and
representatives of local unions on March 18 expressed unanimous
approval for an affirmative strike vote.</em></p>

<p>Government representatives and the Wall Street press, lined up
solidly behind the profiteering coal barons, have been circulating
dire threats of a government &ldquo;seizure&rdquo; of the mines in
the event the miners vote to walk out. The Smith-Connally act makes
strikes illegal in government-operated properties.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Seizures a Fraud</h4>

<p class="fst">Roosevelt&rsquo;s &ldquo;seizure&rdquo; two years ago simply meant
the appointment of the mine owners and their supervisory agents as
&ldquo;government representatives.&rdquo; The private operators
remained in control &ndash; they were just wrapped in an American
flag.</p>

<p>The wage &ldquo;concessions&rdquo; of the operators were an offer
to consider increases in travel time (portal-to-portal) pay, a
fourth-shift differential and vacation pay. This included an offer of
straight-time pay for one hour of travel time instead of the present
two-thirds for 45 minutes; a four and six cents an hour premium
increase respectively for the second- and third shifts, instead of
the demanded 10 and 15 cents. Up to $50 vacation pay was offered for
those with one to five years service and a $100 maximum for all over
five years, instead of the flat $100 for all miners asked by the
union.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Operators Unyielding</h4>

<p class="fst">The operators refused the demand for a 10 cents a ton royalty to
the union&rsquo;s welfare and unemployment fund, claiming this was &ldquo;a
new social theory and philosophy.&rdquo; The WLB itself, however,
approved such a fund for the American Federation of Musicians. The
clothing workers, both AFL and CIO, have similar provisions in their
contracts.</p>

<p><em>All non-wage demands &ndash; including coverage for most
supervisory employees, the right to strike to prevent shipments of
coal to plants where a &ldquo;legal&rdquo; strike is in progress, and
the right to terminate the contract on 20 days&rsquo; notice &ndash;
were rejected. Encouraged by the Roosevelt administration and the
press, the operators are displaying their typical unyielding and
highhanded attitude.</em></p>
