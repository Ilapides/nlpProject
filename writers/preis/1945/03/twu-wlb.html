<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1945/index.htm#m45_09" target="new">Vol.&#160;IX No.&#160;9</a>, 3 March 1945, pp. 1 &amp; 4.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>The CIO Textile Workers Union of America, representing over
500,000 members in the country&rsquo;s lowest-wage industry, on
February 20 withdrew the no-strike pledge for some 100,000
cotton-rayon workers. This is the first formal revocation of the
no-strike policy by any CIO international union since Pearl Harbor.
The action was taken by the TWU Executive Council at a meeting in New
York City just prior to release of the War Labor Board&rsquo;s
long-delayed decision in the textile wage case.</strong></p>

<p><em>At the same time, the union&rsquo;s President, Emil Rieve,
resigned from the WLB &ldquo;in protest against the usurpation of its
functions and the plain fact that the Board has now been reduced to
little more than a rubber stamp.&rdquo; This is especially
significant because Rieve was one of the union leaders who originally
committed organised labor to the no-strike policy and helped
establish the compulsory arbitration WLB.</em></p>

<p>These simultaneous actions are the most serious blows struck at
the union-shackling no-strike policy and Roosevelt&rsquo;s tottering
WLB since the coal strikes two years ago. They are a big advance over
the action of the CtO United Automobile Workers&rsquo; executive
board, which several weeks ago called on the CIO to withdraw its
members from the WLB, but did not recall its own members and
continues to uphold the no-strike surrender policy.</p>

<p>In response to the TWU action, the WLB hastily announced its
decision in the textile wage case. This was a rejection of the 10
cents an hour general wage increase demanded by the union. The board
also halved the union&rsquo;s demand for a boost from 50 cents to a
60 cents an hour wage minimum, conceding only a 55 cents wage floor
for an industry which the board itself admitted &ldquo;pays the
lowest wages of any basic manufacturing industry in America.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>However, this concession, plus some meager &ldquo;fringe&rdquo;
awards, are not going into immediate effect. The board simply
referred them as &ldquo;recommendations&rdquo; to Economic
Stabilization Director Vinson. He must first determine whether such
increases will mean price increases &ndash; the administration&rsquo;s
most recent pretext for stalling wage awards and upholding the
wage-freeze. &rdquo;</em></p>

<p>This belated WLB statement has not altered the TWU actions.
Following the WLB announcement, Rieve issued a press statement
declaring that the union&rsquo;s decision &ldquo;still stands.&rdquo;
He scored the WLB ruling as &ldquo;meaningless&rdquo; and stated it
would &ldquo;not raise the wages of a single cotton- rayon textile
worker.&rdquo; The case, he charged, &ldquo;is still where it was two
months ago &ndash; in Vinson&rsquo;s vest pocket.&rdquo; He frankly
predicted that withdrawal of the no-strike pledge for a large section
of the industry would lead to strikes.</p>

<p>That the TWU top officials were influenced in making their
decision primarily by the terrific pressure of the union&rsquo;s
ranks was clearly indicated by Rieve. He admitted that the union&rsquo;s
officers had been &ldquo;deluged by request for walk-outs in
telegrams by the bushel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The textile union&rsquo;s action is all the more significant
because it is part of important developments reflecting general rank
and file pressure throughout industry for scrapping the no-strike
pledge and scuttling the pro-corporation WLB.</p>

<p>Just prior to the TWU decision, a national gathering of CIO
Packinghouse Workers representatives meeting in Chicago threatened to
revoke the no-strike pledge if the WLB did not immediately release
its decision in the PWU wage case which had been stalled for 19
months. This brought a speedy response with the issuance of a WLB
order denying a general wage increase but recommending &ldquo;fringe&rdquo;
grants. These however must still await approval by Vinson.</p>

<p><em>The CIO United Automobile Workers, largest and most dynamic
union in the country, has urged the withdrawal of labor
representatives from the WLB. This union has just concluded a
national referendum on the no-strike pledge. While the results have
not yet been published, it is conceded that hundreds of thousands of
militant auto and aircraft workers, if not a majority of the union,
have voted to rescind the no-strike policy. A new wave of strikes has
broken out in Detroit, key war industry center, with the
Chrysler-Dodge workers now taking the lead.</em></p>

<p>Moreover, within a few weeks the over 600,000 members of the
powerful United Mine Workers may be enforcing their traditional &ldquo;no
contract, no work&rdquo; policy. The UMW policy committee on February
26 at its opening session to prepare demands for forthcoming contract
negotiations indicated the possibilities of another general mine
strike by sending formal notice to Secretary of Labor Perkins, the
NLRB and WLB that a dispute exists in the industry &ndash; the 30-day
notification of strike intent required under the Smith-Connally
Anti-Strike Law.</p>

<p>Important as all these developments are, they do not yet
constitute a genuine, definitive break with the union leadership&rsquo;s
basic policy of reliance on government agencies and compulsory
arbitration to win the workers&rsquo; just demands. Even Rieve, who
has taken the boldest stand to date of all the CIO leaders, still
holds out the hope of advancing labor&rsquo;s interests by
collaboration with the employers and their government through a
differently constituted board.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Time for Action</h4>

<p class="fst">Thus, the TWU&rsquo;s executive board did not attack the WLB for
what it is &ndash; a government agency deliberately constructed by
Roosevelt, with the aid of the union officials, to curb the unions
and enforce the wage-freeze. The TWU resolution urges CIO withdrawal
from the WLB &ldquo;unless the WLB&rsquo;s original function as a
decision-making body, acting in the interest of equal justice, is
re-established.&rdquo; Of course, the WLB never had and was not
intended to have such a function. That was merely a fiction used to
gain the worker&rsquo;s support for the, board and their surrender of
the strike weapon.</p>

<p><em>Nevertheless, the TWU decisions are further confirmation, of
the correctness of the policies consistently advocated by the
Socialist Workers Party and <strong>The Militant</strong>. From the very first,
the Trotskyists have warned of the disastrous consequences for labor
in the no-strike policy and support of the WLB. Today workers
everywhere are learning the truth of the Trotskyist contentions
through their own bitter experiences. They must now demand that the
lessons of these experiences be translated into decisive action. The
union leaders must be compelled to resign immediately from the
anti-labor WLB. The no-strike policy must be scrapped. A united
militant union offensive must be launched to smash the wage-freezing
Little Steel Formula.</em></p>
