<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1948/index.htm#m48_03" target="new">Vol. XII No. 3</a>, 19 January 1948, p.&nbsp;1.<br />

<p class="fst"><strong>Seventy-nine cents of every dollar the American people will shell out for Truman&rsquo;s proposed 1949 budget of $39,669,000,000 (that&rsquo;s billions) will go tor war &ndash; past, present and future. This does not include items, like the atom bomb development, which are hidden under special misleading headings.</strong></p>

<p>Six times more will be spent for war preparations than for human needs.</p>

<p>Direct military expenditures alone will cost $11,025,000,000 &ndash; 28% of the total &ndash; a $279,000,000 increase over the present budget. The Social Welfare, Health and Security program will take $2,028,000,000 &ndash; $68 million more than before, but one-third less than the $3,147,000,000 in 1940.</p>

<p>Almost 17 times as much will be spent for developing the atom bomb ($674,000,000 under the heading &ndash; Natural resources not primarily agriculture&rdquo;) as for long-range public housing ($40 million).</p>

<p>Truman proposes a &ldquo;first year&rdquo; expenditure of $400,000,000 for &ldquo;universal training&rdquo; &ndash; that is, universal compulsory military training which &ldquo;in full operation will cost about 2 billion dollars annually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the same time, he allocates the magnificent sum of &ndash; $20 million &ndash; to extend unemployment compensation to millions of workers not now covered. He also asks for a new national health insurance fund of $150 million &ndash; to be paid for out of new payroll taxes &ndash; and to cost the government in 1949 just $15,000,000 for administration.</p>

<p>In addition to direct military outlays, Truman proposes to spend $7,009,000,000 to bolster capitalist dictatorships and military machines in Europe, Asia and Latin America &ndash; under the heading of &ldquo;international affairs&rdquo; and &ldquo;foreign relief.&rsquo;&rdquo; This is nearly 1&frac12; billion more than in the present 1948 budget.</p>

<p>Another major war cost will be payment of $5,250,000,000 of interest on public debt &ndash; mostly to bankers and corporations for war loans and on interest-bearing government bonds.</p>

<p>Another $5 billion &ndash; a claimed anticipated surplus of revenue over expenditures &ndash; will go to these same bankers and corporations to pay off a part of the $251 billion war debt.</p>

<p>Still another sum of nearly $2 billion is earmarked for payment to the capitalists. It is buried right at the bottom of the budget under &ldquo;Refund of receipts.&rdquo; This is $1,990,000,000 for war tax rebates mainly to corporations.</p>

<p>The budget proposes $300 million as grants to states for elementary and secondary schooling in the face of the near-collapse of the country&rsquo;s public school systems. Less than half as much for our children&rsquo;s education as for the atom bomb!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Non-Military</h4>

<p class="fst">Only $1,157,000,000 of the budget is designated for general operations other than those concerned with the military. This is less than the 1948 budget total of $1,473,000,000. It gives an idea of what the federal government&rsquo;s operations would cost minus the war machine. Even this item includes a hidden war cost &ndash; $85 million for cemeteries and return of war dead.</p>

<p><em>While interest payments, military preparations and other war costs are higher, there is one war cost that Truman proposes to reduce &ndash; expenditures for the victims of past wars, the veterans. Veteran services and benefits will be cut from $6,632,000,000 in 1948 to $6,102,000,000 in 1949.</em></p>

<p>Compared to his eventual $2 billion annual spending for compulsory military training, his $4,507,000,000 for &ldquo;foreign aid&rdquo; and his $1,250,000,000 for &ldquo;occupation purposes&rdquo; in 1949, Truman has asked for just $571,000,000 in new appropriations for his much-vaunted new social welfare program, which some of the press has dubbed his &ldquo;New Deal.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>More Inflation</h4>

<p class="fst">Included in this &ldquo;New Deal&rdquo; is $80,000,000 of additional expenses for a so-called &ldquo;new anti-inflation program.&rdquo; This useless expenditure just raises the cost of government &ndash; and the inflation.</p>

<p><em>The &ldquo;economy-minded&rdquo; Republicans who dominate Congress have quickly indicated that if there is going to be any cutting of Truman&rsquo;s budget, it will come from the minor items related to human welfare. Thus, Republican Senator Styles Bridges found the military and foreign affairs items &ldquo;realistic,&rdquo; but thought the meager sums for social security, health, education, housing, etc., &ldquo;beyond the means of the nation to meet this year.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Truman&rsquo;s expanding war budget is the greatest single item aggravating the inflation, although he says in his budget message that &ldquo;we are all aware of the imperative necessity for preventing further inflation.&rdquo; One of his major proposals on this score is:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;I am not recommending at this time cost-of-living increases in pay for military and civilian government personnel, nor cost-of-living increases in benefits for our veterans, social insurance beneficiaries, retired Federal employees and other similar groups,&rdquo; although &ldquo;the rapid increase in living costs ... has placed a serious burden on these groups.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Surplus to Bankers</h4>

<p class="fst">Truman&rsquo;s claimed anticipated surplus of $5 billion in 1949 is all going to pay the war debt to the bankers.</p>

<p><em>The budget figures give the lie direct to Truman&rsquo;s &ldquo;State of the Union&rdquo; speech where he demagogically said he wants to cut income taxes $40 a year for every individual and put additional taxes on corporation profits.</em></p>

<p>His own estimate of direct taxes on individuals in 1949 totals $23,322,000,000, compared to $22,793,000,000 in 1948. Total direct taxes on corporations will be only $610,000,000 more in 1949 than 1948. But Truman doesn&rsquo;t expect Congress to follow his tax proposals anyway.</p>

<p>The cold figures of Truman&rsquo;s budget add up to &ndash; inflation, war, human agony.</p>
