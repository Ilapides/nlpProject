<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1948/index.htm#m48_12" target="new">Vol. XII No. 12</a>, 22 March 1948, pp.&nbsp;1 &amp;&nbsp;2.</P>
<HR>
<P><B>Washington is deliberately whipping up a war hysteria.</B></P>
<P><B>The events in Czechoslovakia have provided Truman, the State
Department and the Big Brass with the pretext for a warmongering
drive unparalleled in the peacetime history of the country.</B></P>
<P>Every major capitalist newspaper and all the radio stations have
been screaming war incitements. Each new headline in the past three
weeks has blazoned further provocative statements by the top
government officials and militarists.</P>
<P>This campaign was climaxed on March 17 by Truman&rsquo;s speech to
a special joint session of Congress &ndash; a speech that left no
doubt that the Administration is definitely committed to war.</P>
<P><I>How soon the nation will be plunged into another imperialist
blood-bath no one, of course, can say. But there can be no doubt
whatsoever that American imperialism intends to go to war, that war
is the end-object of its international strategy.</I></P>
<P>Wall Street&rsquo;s course, as Truman made plain in his address to
Congress, is toward the speediest preparation of public opinion and
the military machine for a world conflict of atomic annihilation.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Truman&rsquo;s Demands</H4>
<P>Truman attacked Russia in the most savage terms, accusing it of
sole responsibility for endangering the peace. He called for
universal compulsory military training, establishment of peacetime
conscription and huge expansion of the armed forces. He demanded
immediate passage of the so-called European Recovery Program as the
direct implementation of the West European military alliance against
Russia.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Measures for economic rehabilitation alone are not enough,&rdquo;
he said, hailing the Five-Power Military Paect signed that very day
and pledging &ldquo;full support&rdquo; by the United States.</P>
<P>He bemoaned the &ldquo;tragic death&rdquo; of Czechoslovakia,
which Roosevelt and Churchill themselves, at Yalta, had tossed into
Stalin&rsquo;s &ldquo;sphere of influence.&rdquo; The U.S. Army, on
orders from the State Department halted 50 miles from Prague in 1945
to permit occupation by the Russian army.</P>
<P><I>Truman&rsquo;s demonstrative action in calling the joint
session followed a series of statements and actions by State
Department and military officials designed to arouse public war fever
and stampede Congress into speedy passage of the demanded war
measures.</I></P>
<P>Secretary of State Marshall issued an alarmist press statement
terming the international situation! &ldquo;very, very serious.&rdquo;
Secretary of National Defense Forrestal hastily called a secret
conference of the General Staffs of all the armed services in Key
West, Florida. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no secret,&rdquo; said the
Scripps-Howar newspaper chain on March 13, &ldquo;that Mr. Forrestal
and joint chiefs of staff are worried sick at imminent threat of war&rdquo;
and are &ldquo;thinking in terms of immediate mobilization.&rdquo;<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Use Armed Forces</H4>
<P>Former Secretary of State Byrnes, author of the
&ldquo;get-tough-with-Russia&rdquo; policy, demanded that the United
States &ldquo;act&rdquo; if the Communist Party wins the April 18
election in Italy and use U.S. armed forces to preserve the &ldquo;<I>status
quo</I>.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The whole sequence of events establishes pretty definitely that
Truman and the militarists now in control of U.S. foreign policy are
deliberately pushing toward war.</P>
<P><I>Prior to his Czechoslovakia coup, it has now leaked out, Stalin
made a direct bid to Washington for another deal. Stalin&rsquo;s
offer to meet with Truman was made &ldquo;late in January&rdquo; and
was &ldquo;turned down,&rdquo; the Mar. 5 <B>U.S. News</B> disclosed.
<B>Business Week</B> of Mar. 6 revealed that &ldquo;official
Washington &ndash; and that means the State department and the
military &ndash; has brushed aside Russia&rsquo;s January peace
feelers.&rdquo;</I></P>
<P>This news was suppressed. The American people were kept in the
dark while Wall Street&rsquo;s agents in Washington developed their
campaign to force matters to a showdown. Stalin&rsquo;s subsequent
move to consolidate his grip on Czechoslovakia provided the pretext
for the long-planned campaign of war hysteria.</P>
<P>This is now being stirred to a more frenzied pitch over the coming
elections in Italy.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Brazen Attempt</H4>
<P>Rarely has there been so brazen an attempt by a foreign power to
interfere with an election in another country, as Washington is
engaged in. The State Department has threatened to cut off any
economic aid to Italy if the Communist Party (Stalinists) gain a
majority in an election run by the Italian capitalist government.
Speaker of the House Martin has called on Italians in this country to
write their relatives to vote against the Communist Party.</P>
<P>As the war scare grew, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the ERP
bill and the House is being whipped into line for quick action.</P>
<P>Then Marshall, on Mar. 15, told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee that the situation in Greece has become &ldquo;worse&rdquo;
despite the 250 million dollars in U.S. military supplies given the
Greek monarchists. He complained that Turkey was so strained by
military preparations that its economy is in dire straits. He urged
that more money and arms be poured into these countries.</P>
<P><I>U.S. imperialism finds it cannot prop up capitalist reaction
anywhere by purely economic means. The regime of Chiang Kai-shek is
in dire straits and China is in a state of hopeless chaos. Now the
clamor is going up for more military aid to Kuomintang China.</I></P>
<P>Thus, the Marshall Plan is becoming more and more a scheme to arm
the military entente which U.S. imperialism is building. The nucleus
of that entente is the 50-year military alliance between England,
France, Holland, Belgium and Luxemburg. Other countries &ndash; 14 in
number so far &ndash; are being lined up through the ERP conference
now in progress in Paris.</P>
<P>Even the Western Zone of Germany, under British, U.S. and French
occupation, has been invited into the ERP. Wall Street is now seeking
to build up and integrate a capitalist Western Germany into its
military bloc.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>&ldquo;New Concept&rdquo;</H4>
<P>The chief of the Decartelization Branch staff of the U.S.
occupation government in Germany, Richard Bronson, informed his staff
in Berlin on Mar. 15 that General Clay has a &ldquo;new concept of
industrial decentralization.&rdquo; War industry cartels will not be
decentralized because &ldquo;we have got to think about the war.&rdquo;</P>
<P>All these developments unmistakably mark the drive of Truman and
the militarists toward war. The war hysteria campaign is designed to
prepare public opinion for a military adventure any time America&rsquo;s
rulers see fit to begin armed hostilities. The program of war
preparations is being pushed aggressively, with plans for new huge
increases in the military budget. Now the draft and UMT have been put
at the top of the Administration&rsquo;s agenda to regiment the
nation under military rule.</P>
