<HR>
<P>The iron boot of militarist censorship and suppression is poised
over freedom of the press in America.</P>
<P>So drastic and far-reaching are plans of the military authorities
for control of the press that even some publishers are alarmed:</P>
<P>In a four-article series entitled <I>The Problem of Secrecy</I>
(<B>N.Y. Times</B>, March 3, 5, 6 and 7), Hanson W. Baldwin,
commentator on military affairs for the <B>N.Y. Times</B>, reveals
that suppression of news, intimidation and harassment of reporters
and publishers, and censorship for alleged &ldquo;military security&rdquo;
is already far advanced.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Complete Blackout</H4>
<P>He discloses that the Big Brass and the Truman administration are
building up a system of news censorship that would in a short time
impose a complete blackout on any information or criticism they did
not want published.</P>
<P>There have been &ldquo;months of behind-the-scenes discussions and
considerable pressure by some Government officials, particularly some
in the National Military Establishment, to control the military,
semimilitary and even politico-military information published in this
country,&rdquo; Baldwin reports. These officials &ldquo;are plainly
impatient with public criticism and would like to devise some system
by which the press could be better &lsquo;controlled&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
<P>This pressure, he adds, &ldquo;has also come from the White
House.&rdquo;</P>
<P><I>The first &ldquo;considerable anxiety&rdquo; felt about the
military threat to press freedom, says Baldwin, was last Fall &ldquo;when
it became known that the Security Advisory Board of the State
Department-Army-Navy-Air Force Coordinating Committee had proposed to
&lsquo;classify&rsquo; and to ban from public disclosure even
information that might cause &lsquo;serious administrative
embarrassment&rsquo;.&rdquo;</I></P>
<P>Such censorship, Baldwin points out, could &ldquo;provide a cloak
to hide&rdquo; any inefficient and even criminal conduct of
government and military officials, such as the case of Maj. Gen.
Bennett E. Meyers.</P>
<P>Protest against this proposal was &ldquo;so vocal&rdquo; that the
Security Advisory Board revised its definition of. &ldquo;classified&rdquo;
and &ldquo;secret&rdquo; information by rewording some of the cruder
formulas. But it still defines as &ldquo;secret&rdquo; any
information that would cause &ldquo;unwarranted injury to an
individual.&rdquo; This, says Baldwin, could obviously be used &ldquo;to
protect Government officials from criticism.&rdquo;</P>
<P>In addition to the extensive system of &ldquo;classified&rdquo;
information, reports Baldwin, there are many other methods of
censorship and suppression now being practiced. He cites, for
instance, the repeated complaints of censorship of correspondents in
Japan by Gen. Douglas MacArthur.</P>
<P>Recently, MacArthur refused to reaccredit to his command area the
<B>Newsweek</B> correspondent, Compton Pakenham, because he showed
&ldquo;marked antipathy toward American policy and American personnel
in the occupation zone.&rdquo; Some correspondents &ldquo;have been
subjected to threats and grilling; the home of one man was searched
by the Army&rsquo;s Criminal Investigation Department.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;MacArthur precedent,&rdquo; says Baldwin, &ldquo;has now been
extended to Europe.&rdquo;</P>
<P><I>A United Press correspondent, Robert Miller, who recently
visited Saudi Arabia, &ldquo;learned that King Ibn Saud, with the
full cooperation, and perhaps at the instigation of the United States
Army, State Department and oil company officials, had banned all
American newspaper correspondents from his country.&rdquo;</I></P>
<P>In another case, an interview with Charles F. Wennerstrum, who
presided over the recent trial of Nazis in Frankfurt, was subject to
harsh attack before it was even published in the <B>Chicago Tribune</B>.
&ldquo;Obviously, some Army source read the dispatch before or during
its transmission ... despite the fact that wire communications are
supposed to be inviolable,&rdquo; says Baldwin. He adds: &ldquo;This
sort of &lsquo;censorship by surveillance&rsquo; or by threat was
practiced extensively before the war in Nazi Germany.&rdquo;<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Grilled by FBI</H4>
<P>Robert H. Wood, editor of <B>Aviation Week</B>, a McGraw-Hill
publication, has been grilled repeatedly by FBI agents for publishing
a story, well-known outside of Air Force circles, about the
supersonic speed of the Bell XS-1, modeled on a captured Nazi design.
The Russians had also captured the design, so anything <B>Aviation
Week</B> published was not news to them.</P>
<P><I>What is serious about this case, Baldwin points out, is that
the Air Force secured the aid of the Department of Justice and FBI
for a &ldquo;punitive and threatening measure&rdquo; to force a
publication to disclose the source of its information &ldquo;and
presumably to impress and overawe it.&rdquo; This case, further, is
being used as an argument for legislation to &ldquo;give the
Government the legal club needed to restrict the flow of news to what
it considered desirable.&rdquo;</I></P>
<P>A bill has been prepared with terms &ldquo;so broad &ndash; it
defines as a criminal offense, for instance, the transmission of any
&lsquo;information&rsquo; concerning the national defense &lsquo;to
any person not entitled to receive it&rsquo; &ndash; that it could be
used, and undoubtedly would be used, in the light of past experience,
to limit the legitimate information media of the country.&rdquo;</P>
<P>But, as Baldwin shows, the military aren&rsquo;t even waiting to
get their censorship system legalized.</P>
<P><I>On March 3, representatives of the big newspapers, magazines
and publishing houses conferred with Secretary of Defense Forrestal
and proposed a system of &ldquo;voluntary censorship&rdquo; as a
means of avoiding direct censorship.</I></P>
<P>This &ldquo;voluntary censorship,&rdquo; says Baldwin, &ldquo;might
well turn out more theoretical than real.&rdquo; Any publication that
printed information the government wanted withheld would be
&ldquo;subjected to all sorts of government pressure; its sources of
information might be closed up: it would probably be called
&lsquo;unpatriotic,&rsquo; etc.&rdquo; Even &ldquo;voluntary
censorship,&rdquo; he says, can be used &ldquo;as a powerful
restraining influence on the flow of information.&rdquo;</P>
