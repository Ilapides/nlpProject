<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1948/index.htm#m48_13" target="new">Vol. XII No. 13</a>, 29 March 1948, p.&nbsp;4.</P>
<HR>
<P>In 1938 <B>The Militant</B> proposed, a wage program for the
American labor movement in anticipation of the coming war and the
inevitable war-borne inflation, called &ldquo;The Sliding Scale of
Wages.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The predicted inflation has followed a nine-year course. Despite
the recent slump in the wholesale commodity market prices, the
cost-of-living is substantially what it was in January, at the peak
of the price spiral and prices are resuming their upward trend.</P>
<P>Today, many far-seeing union militants have come to the conclusion
that the principle of the sliding scale of wages, or, as it is often
called, the cost-of-living bonus, contains the only immediately
effective protection for real wages against rising prices.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Set Wage, Sliding Bonus</H4>
<P>This is a bonus to be paid <I>in addition</I> to the negotiated
wage scale. The latter remains fixed during the life of the contract
regardless of the ups or downs of prices. But the bonus is paid <I>over
and above regular wages</I> if the cost of living rises, and in
amounts directly proportional to the increase of prices, Thus, the
bonus is adjustable; the basic wage is fixed. If prices go up, the
bonus goes up proportionately. If prices go down, the bonus goes
down. But the basic hourly wages remain the same during the life of
the contract.</P>
<P><I>The demand for the sliding scale cost-of-living bonus was first
put forward by the CIO Packinghouse Workers during negotiations in
the Spring of 1947. The UPW leaders did hot press for the demand,
however, and settled for a small fixed wage increase. The CIO Rubber
Workers have now called for a sliding scale cost-of-living bonus in
addition to a 30-cent hourly basic wage increase in their present
negotiations.</I></P>
<P>For the most part, however, the top CIO leaders have opposed this
program. Their method of opposition has usually been evasion of the
issue, rather than direct attack. But now, for the first time since
1938 we have the opportunity to defend this program in debate with
attempted reasoned arguments against it. The Reutherites in the CIO
Automobile Workers, who have opposed the sliding scale bonus demand
as proposed by five UAW local presidents in Flint, have set forth the
reasons for their opposition publicly and in detail.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Opposition&rsquo;s Arguments</H4>
<P>Their arguments are contained in a lengthy article entitled
<I>Escalator Clause</I>, signed by Coburn S. Walker, financial
secretary of Chevrolet Local 659, Flint, and published in the Feb. 12
issue of <B>The Searchlight</B>, Local 659&rsquo;s paper.</P>
<P>Walker&rsquo;s article is based largely on the example of the
operations of a sliding scale wage clause in the contract of the
Sinclair Oil Co. with the CIO Oil Workers International Union. Walker
rests his arguments on his interpretation of a letter sent to the UAW
by E.E. Phelps, OWIU Director of Research and Education.</P>
<P>This letter also published in <B>The Searchlight</B>, says the
Sinclair workers secured a cost-of-living sliding scale contract
which was in effect from Januarv to Sept. 15, 1947. After eight
months, the escalator clause was dropped and a fixed wage increase
alone was written in the contract.</P>
<P><I>What were the effects of the escalator clause and would the
Sinclair workers have done better if they had retained the clause?
Phelps&rsquo; letter, though it attempts to justify the
discontinuation of the clause, shows that if it had been retained,
the Sinclair workers would have received higher wages than they now
have.</I></P>
<P>He says that only Sinclair and a few of the smaller oil companies
agreed to the sliding scale of wages principle. The big companies
insisted on fixed wage scales &ldquo;sometimes nearly meeting&rdquo;
the wages paid the Sinclair workers. At the time the Sinclair
workers&rsquo; contract was changed, they were getting &ldquo;3 cents
above what competitive companies&rsquo; agreements called for.&rdquo;</P>
<P><I>At that time &ndash; midsummer of 1947 &ndash; the leaders of
the OWIU thought that the economic situation &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t
forecast any further sharp increases&rdquo; in prices. They decided
to consolidate their sliding scale increases on the basis of a
25-cent an hour raise in basic wages. The actual contracts signed
provided, in most cases, a 15-cent basic raise, plus a 10-cent bonus
to continue until the summer of 1948.</I></P>
<P>Had the old contract continued, however, Phelps now admits, &ldquo;<I>the
economic conditions would have benefited the membership to the extent
of about 10 cents an hour.&rdquo;</I></P>
<P>Phelps further reveals that &ldquo;a few settlements have been
made containing these minimum base rate adjustments (25-30 cents an
hour), ACCOMPANIED WITH A FURTHER COST OF LIVING BONUS THAT PAYS AS
MUCH AS 7 TO 12 CENTS (an hour)).&rdquo;<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Two Things Clear</H4>
<P>Two things stand out pretty clearly in Phelps&rsquo; letter.
First, the oil workers raised their wages 28 cents an hour during the
period that all other CIO unions, including the auto workers, got
raises of only 10 to 15 cents an hour. Second, for some of the oil
workers, their full cost-of-living increase has been converted into a
permanent basic increase &ndash; plus cost-of-living bonuses of 7 to
12 cents.</P>
<P>Walker takes the fact that the Sinclair workers discontinued their
particular escalator clause as a demonstration that all such clauses
are no good. He says, for instance,</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&ldquo;If the UAW accepts the Sinclair Oil type of
escalator clause, AS RECOMMENDED BY PALMER (former Local 659
president), a fall in prices would leave the workers with no gain in
their living standards.&rdquo;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>But then, in the very next sentence, Walker contradicts
himself: &ldquo;Palmer and his friends are really asking for
something different from what the Oil Workers got.&rdquo;</I></P>
<P>The original Sinclair Oil contract tied all wages to prices. That
is one type of escalator clause. It has a possible weakness if prices
should fall below those at the time the contract was signed.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Basic and Bonus</H4>
<P>But the program advanced by the Flint local presidents and the
rubber and packinghouse workers <I>doesn&rsquo;t tie basic wages to
prices</I>. It calls for basic wage increases PLUS a cost-of-living
bonus adjustable for price rises. Walker&rsquo;s only answer to the
real demand formulated by the Flint local presidents is that it is
&ldquo;illogical.&rdquo; Why, he asks, should the basic wage be
fixed, while only the bonus is adjusted to price movements?</P>
<P>Far from being &ldquo;illogical,&rdquo; it is exactly what the
situation calls for. Even Phelps&rsquo; letter indicates that in some
of the oil companies, WHERE THE WORKERS WERE READY AND ABLE TO
ENFORCE THEIR DEMANDS, they got not only a basic wage increase of 25
to 30 cents an hour, but also &ldquo;a further cost of living bonus
that pays as much as 7 to 12 cents.&rdquo; During the same period the
auto workers have received only an 11&frac12;-cent basic raise.</P>
<P><I>Another argument of Walker is that &ldquo;escalator clauses
freeze workers living standards and prevent them from improving the
conditions of their families.&rdquo; This would not have happened if
the UAW contracts even had an admittedly inadequate escalator clause
like the Sinclair Oil workers. It is estimated that, even in that
case, the average auto worker would have received $500 more in wages
than he actually received and today would be enjoying $50 more a
month.</I></P>
<P>But the Sinclair contract, as Walker admits, is <I>not</I> what
the UAW progressives ask. They ask for a wage program that will
improve the workers&rsquo; living standard and <I>keep it improved</I>.
That&rsquo;s why they want their basic wages fortified by a
cost-of-living bonus.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Present UAW Demands</H4>
<P>As a matter of fact, the present basic wage demands of the UAW are
not designed to improve living standards, at all, but just to restore
them to the level of June 1946. Walker himself says that 15 cents of
the demand is to restore the living standards of two years ago and
the other 10 cents is for further price rises which &ldquo;the Board
expected.&rdquo; This is just a program of chasing after high prices.</P>
<P>Walker&rsquo;s &ndash; or rather the Reutherites&rsquo; &ndash;
arguments break down at every stage. They say escalator clauses might
result in pay cuts. Then they say that the sliding scale
cost-of-living bonus, which does not have this weakness, is an
&ldquo;illogical&rdquo; demand. Why this is any more illogical than
the simultaneous demand for basic wage increases and pensions, they
don&rsquo;t explain.</P>
<P>The two wage demands proposed by the UAW progressives deal with
two different aspects of the wage question:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>The improvement of living standards through basic wage
	increases;<BR>&nbsp;</P>
	<LI><P>The protection of basic wage increases from future price
	rises through a cost-of-living bonus clause.</P>
</OL>
<P>It is because they confuse these two different aspects of the wage
question that the Reutherites raise such contradictory and foolish
arguments against the cost-of-living bonus wage programs.</P>
