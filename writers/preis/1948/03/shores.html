<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1948/index.htm#m48_13" target="new">Vol. XII No. 13</a>, 29 March 1948, p.&nbsp;4.</P>
<HR>
<P>We&rsquo;ve been reading in the past few weeks the testimony of
the military experts on how &ldquo;weak&rdquo; the U.S., armed forces
are. True enough, the atomic bomb is in mass production. But this
country is being &ldquo;threatened&rdquo; and where is the &ldquo;trained
manpower&rdquo; to &ldquo;defend our shores?&rdquo;</P>
<P>Probably you are one of the many millions of Americans who think
&ldquo;our shores&rdquo; or &ldquo;our borders&rdquo; can be located
on any standard map. Defined on the north and south by treaties with
Canada and Mexico; fenced in on the east and west by Acts of God, the
Atlantic and Pacific.</P>
<P>But there you are in error, according to the military-experts.
&ldquo;Our borders&rdquo; are very elastic. They stretch like a big
rubber band and include about every habitable and uninhabitable
portion of the globe. You can take Secretary of State Marshall&rsquo;s
word, for that.</P>
<P>&ldquo;Our responsibilities&rdquo; and &ldquo;our leadership&rdquo;
and &ldquo;our interests,&rdquo; he told a Berkeley, California,
audience on March 19, &ldquo;are not confined to Europe.&rdquo; Not
even to Europe! &ldquo;They exist in the Middle East, in Indonesia,
in China &ndash; and we cannot ignore Latin America, or our direct
responsibilities in Japan and Korea.&rdquo;</P>
<P>When you take this broad view of &ldquo;our borders&rdquo; which
we must &ldquo;defend from aggression,&rdquo; it becomes clear why
Russia is such a grave menace. We are entirely surrounded by Russia,
like the drunk who felt his way all around a tree and exclaimed,
&ldquo;Trapped!&rdquo;</P>
<P>We are &ldquo;contained&rdquo; on the Danube, the Persian Gulf,
the Japanese Sea and beyond the Yangzte River. We stand guard at
Tierra Del Fuego and glare eye to eye with the &ldquo;red hordes&rdquo;
across the Antarctic reaches. And let us not forget &ldquo;our
border&rdquo; in &ndash; Indonesia &ndash; now patrolled by U.
.-equipped-and-trained Netherlands troops fighting the good fight for
&ldquo;American democracy&rdquo; against the Javanese republican
&ldquo;bandits.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Of course, if you don&rsquo;t look at &ldquo;our borders&rdquo;
with the sternly patriotic eye of a Wall Street imperialist or
militarist, you are apt to see the political map in a different
perspective. You might be tempted to say, &ldquo;It looks like we&rsquo;ve
got those Russians squeezed in a vise.&rdquo;</P>
<P>You might even be led to the further conclusion, &ldquo;It looks
like Russia is surrounded and threatened on all sides by American
imperialism. It looks like the U.S. has its hooks in most of the
world &ndash; and Russia is next.&rdquo;</P>
<P>You&rsquo;d be right, too.</P>
<P>The next time you hear that radio propagandist or read the
testimony of that brass hat before a Senate committee telling you we
need UMT and the draft and more billions for arms to &ldquo;defend
our country&rdquo; &ndash; remember he&rsquo;s not talking about
&ldquo;from the rocky shores of Maine to the sunny strands of
California.&rdquo; He means the whole planet.</P>
