<HR>
<P>Henry, Agard Wallace is a middle-class, capitalist politician who
feeds on liberal-sounding words. These he chews over like a cow does
its cud. He never tires of the flavor of such phrases as the &ldquo;Common
Man,&rdquo; the &ldquo;General Welfare&rdquo; and &ldquo;Progressivism.&rdquo;
And who dares oppose these?</P>
<P>Liberal phonies always use such glittering generalities. Only
Wallace repeats them more often, more vaguely and more shamelessly.
This windy demagogy is the foundation of his reputation as a
&ldquo;Champion of the People.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Fortunately, we are not forced to judge him by words alone.
Wallace has had ample opportunity to demonstrate in deeds his
self-proclaimed love for the &ldquo;common man.&rdquo; He was a top
figure in the government for 13&frac12; years and once bore the proud
title of Roosevelt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Crown Prince.&rdquo;</P>
<P>In all those years he did not do a single thing of benefit for the
&ldquo;common man&rdquo; &ndash; not for the workers, the Negro
people, the poor farmers and sharecroppers or the small business man.</P>
<P>His deeds in office were an <I>unbroken chain of reaction</I>.
That is a matter, of public record, if not of public knowledge. Most
of the facts have now been conveniently compiled in a book, <B>Henry
Wallace &ndash; The Man and the Myth</B> by Dwight Macdonald.
(Vanguard Press, Inc., New York City).</P>
<P>Wallace was the Roosevelt administration&rsquo;s loudest
warmonger, jingo and apologist for U.S. imperialist participation in
World War II.</P>
<P><I>He was a member of Roosevelt&rsquo;s secret policy group that
initiated the development of the atomic bomb. He hailed this most
fiendish instrument of war as a major triumph of Roosevelt and the
&ldquo;New Deal.&rdquo;</I></P>
<P>He upheld Roosevelt&rsquo;s wartime demand for Saudi Arabian oil,
boasting this &ldquo;was not ruthless imperialism but good
old-fashioned American imperialism&rdquo; and &ldquo;the United
States: is proud of it.&rdquo;</P>
<P>He defends to this day the dismemberment of Germany, starvation
rations for the German people and continued ruthless military
occupation of the conquered countries.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>&ldquo;World Peace&rdquo; Formula</H4>
<P>His &ldquo;anti-imperialist&rdquo; program, stated most fully and
crudely in his Madison Square Garden speech in September 1946 calls
for an agreement between Washington and the Kremlin to divide the
world between them. That is his formula for &ldquo;world peace.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Here are some highlights of his record on the &ldquo;common man&rdquo;
at home:</P>
<P>He put through, as Secretary of Agriculture, a program of &ldquo;planned
scarcity,&rdquo; whereby the big landowners were paid to destroy
crops and livestock to boost prices in a world of unemployment and
hunger.</P>
<P><I>He fired his own &ldquo;New Deal&rdquo; colleagues out of the
Department of Agriculture at the behest of cotton speculators,
textile interests and the : reactionary Farm Bureau of big
landowners.</I></P>
<P>He falsely interpreted a clause in the Agricultural Adjustment
Act. to permit wealthy landowners to reduce acreage by evicting
thousands of tenant-farmers and sharecroppers.</P>
<P>He repudiated, at the climax of the 1946 General Motors strike, a
confidential report of Commerce Department economist&rsquo;s which he
himself had released before the strike and which showed that the auto
corporations could raise wages 10% without raising prices.</P>
<P><I>He demanded, just after the 1946 coal strike, that the
government take over strike-threatened industries and that the
workers, &ldquo;like other federal employeee, give up the right to
... strike.&rdquo;</I></P>
<P>He rudely refused to see a Negro delegation and sneaked out on
them when they came to appeal for aid in saving the life of the
Virginia sharecropper Odell Waller, who was later executed for his
self-defense slaying of a white man.</P>
<P>He surrounded himself, as Secretary of Commerce, with a retinue of
conservative big businessmen and proclaimed himself &ldquo;the
representative of business in government.&rdquo;<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Defends Profit System</H4>
<P>He has championed consistently but one program, &ldquo;the
preservation of our democratic free enterprise system&rdquo; &ndash;
that is, the capitalist exploitation of labor for private profit.</P>
<P>These fully documented damning facts go unchallenged and
unmentioned in an attempted reply to Macdonald&rsquo;s book in a
review by Russell Lord in the March 1 <B>New Republic</B>, Wallace&rsquo;s
mouthpiece.</P>
<P>Lord treats us to the worshipful disciple&rsquo;s fanciful
portrait of Wallace, &ldquo;profoundly simple, profoundly practical
... it is certain he will keep growing.&rdquo; Lord concerns himself
chiefly with heated denials of the least important aspects of
Macdonald&rsquo;s book, his psychological and moral appraisals of
Wallace.</P>
<P>The record cited by Macdonald shows that Wallace is a &ldquo;trimmer,
hedger and chronic reneger&rdquo; who &ldquo;lacks the guts to stand
up under pressure.&rdquo; But Macdonald overemphasizes personal
quirks and traits and leaves out the key to a real understanding of
Wallace.</P>
<P><I>That key is the class character of Wallace, his politics and
his movement. In every major test of his career Wallace has proved
himself a loyal defender of capitalism and American imperialism.</I></P>
<P>From 1933 to 1940, when Wallace headed the Department of
Agriculture, he faithfully served the rich landowners against the
poor farmers, tenant-farmers, sharecroppers and low-wage consumers.
He worked most closely with the Farm Bureau Federation, the lobby of
the &ldquo;400-acre farmers.&rdquo; The Farm Bureau&rsquo;s 1,800
county agents became the local agents of the Agricultural Adjustment
Administration (AAA).</P>
<P>The AAA paid landowning farmers to withdraw a portion of their
land from cultivation in order to reduce crops and raise prices. But
the majority of farmers are tenants and sharecroppers and only
<I>landowners</I> received benefits. The landowners. first withdrew
from production land occupied by tenants and share-croppers. These
not only were deprived of a livelihood, but were kicked out of their
homes.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Wallace&rsquo;s Sell-Out</H4>
<P>A clause in the AAA contract said that the landlord &ldquo;shall
permit all tenants to continue in occupancy of their houses on this
farm, rent free, for the years 1934 and 1935.&rdquo; The Southern
Tenant Farmers Union protested there were hundreds of evictions in
spite of this clause. Wallace fired several of his aides who
supported the tenants. He said , the clause did not mean the same
tenants must remain, <I>only the same number of tenants</I>. The
Arkansas courts promptly accepted his interpretation and upheld
hundreds of evictions.</P>
<P><I>Ten years later, when he was Secretary of Commence, Wallace
followed similar policies. He appointed as his undersecretary Alfred
Schinder, a conservative big businessman who had previously served
under banker Jesse Jones. Another ton job went to Albert J. Browning,
who called for incentive wages. Wallace brushed aside the small
business interests who sought his aid against the monopolies. The May
20, 1945 <B>N.Y. Times</B> published a special article describing the
surprise and pleasure of Big Business at Wallace&rsquo;s policies.</I></P>
<P>While Vice President, from 1940 to 1944, Wallace destroyed any
claim he might have to being &ldquo;anti-war&rdquo; and
&ldquo;anti-imperialist.&rdquo; He served the special role of
whitewashing the imperialist character of the war and dressing up its
sordid aims. In his highly-publicized address on the &ldquo;People&rsquo;s
Century,&rdquo; he lied about the war as a &ldquo;people&rsquo;s
war,&rdquo; even a &ldquo;people&rsquo;s revolution,&rdquo; whose aim
was to bring a quart of milk a day to every child in the world.</P>
<P>Today, as we all know, not the least result of the war has been to
bring starvation and death to millions of children in Europe and
Asia.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Deal with Stalin</H4>
<P>Wallace&rsquo;s campaign for a deal with Russia and his expulsion
from the Truman, administration over this issue has led to the charge
that he is &ldquo;pro-Russian&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Communist
fellow-traveller.&rdquo; Macdonald&rsquo;s crude Stalinophobia and
lack of a class approach to politics leads him to make similar
charges.</P>
<P>Wallace is just as much an American imperialist today as he was
during the war. He is no more &ldquo;pro-Russian&rdquo; than were the
capitalist politicians &ndash; from the White House down &ndash; who
whitewashed the crimes of Stalin during wartime, just as the
Stalinists whitewashed Wall Street and its chief political agent,
Roosevelt.</P>
<P><I>Wallace, today asks no more than Roosevelt and Churchill agreed
to, in essence, at Teheran and Yalta, and Truman underwrote , at
Potsdam. He wants to give American capitalism a breathing spell
through another deal with Stalin to divide the world into &ldquo;spheres
of influence.&rdquo; Wallace&rsquo;s differences with Truman are
tactical, not fundamental.</I></P>
<P>What Wallace wants he stated in his Madison Square Garden speech,
on Sept. 12, 1946. He declared that &ldquo;by mutual agreement, this
competition should be put on a friendly basis&rdquo; and mutual fears
should be &ldquo;allayed by practical regional political
reservations.&rdquo; These &ldquo;regional reservations&rdquo;, he
stated, would include the one-third of the world which &ldquo;Russian
ideas ... are going to govern&rdquo; and &ldquo;much of the rest&rdquo;
of the world where &ldquo;American Ideals&rdquo; will rule,</P>
<P>This is dirty horse-trading disguised as a &ldquo;peace&rdquo;
program. It is Wallace&rsquo;s chief plank today &ndash; the most he
has to offer the &ldquo;Common Man.&rdquo;</P>
