<HR>
<P>Housing shortage got you down? A couple of real estate brokers
named Philip Murray and William Green are seeking a new tenant for
one of the choicest residences in Washington, D.C. It&rsquo;s in an
exclusive neighborhood, but close to the shopping district. It&rsquo;s
equipped with a new $15,000 balcony for sun-bathing. And it&rsquo;s
rent free &ndash; with a $75,000 a year honorarium. Just to help you
keep up this elegant joint.</P>
<P>But before you start writing any letters like &ldquo;Dear Sirs:
I&rsquo;m a veteran with a wife and two kids living in a one-room
cold-water flat,&rdquo; you should know there are a few strings
attached to the deal. The lease contains a list of restrictive
covenants a yard long &ndash; and the usual one barring occupancy by
&ldquo;non-Caucasians&rdquo; is just a starter.</P>
<P>Labor leaders, non-believers in capitalist &ldquo;free
enterprise,&rdquo; working-class radicals of any stripe are strictly
<I>verboten.</I> The new tenant must be some solid citizen, with
respect for property, law and order and the established two-party
system. He must have some good Wall Street references, comport
himself in a decorous and conservative fashion, but at the same time
be able, when the occasion requires, to talk a polite brand of
&ldquo;liberalism.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Murray &amp; Green, Inc., would prefer, if possible, a tenant of
long-standing devotion to the Democratic Party. But a Republican
might prove acceptable if he can meet all the other qualifications.</P>
<P>There&rsquo;s one other very important restriction. Opponents of
the Truman Doctrine are barred from the start. Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t
stand four-square for American imperialism, support of anti-labor
regimes in Europe and preparations for World War III against the
Soviet Union had better not send in an application for White House
tenancy to Murray &amp; Green, Inc.</P>
<P>But, you will probably ask, why arc these real estate brokers &ndash;
-whose sideline, incidentally, is holding union offices &ndash;
looking for a new tenant? Don&rsquo;t they have a desirable tenant in
the White House now? Well, yes &ndash; and no.</P>
<P>If it were altogether up to Murray and Green, they&rsquo;d renew
Harry S. Truman&rsquo;s lease in a minute, But there&rsquo;s one
further little hitch.</P>
<P>The lease to the White House has to be renewed every four years
and signed by a majority vote of the American electorate &ndash;
meaning principally the workers. And Truman, it looks like now, is
suffering from an aggravated case of political halitosis. Even his
best friends arc beginning to tell him so.</P>
<P>So, Murray &amp; Green, Inc., have to scram around at this late
date to line up a possible new tenant, acceptable to the landlord,
Wall Street, and yet who can turn on the &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; charm
like a neon sign and attract the labor vote. That kind of tenant is
scarce as hen&rsquo;s teeth today.</P>
