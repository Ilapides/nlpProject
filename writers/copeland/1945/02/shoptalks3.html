<p class="fst">&ldquo;I don't care what you say,&rdquo; Scissorbill Sam (the
bosses&rsquo; man) was very positive. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take all
the factories away from the owners. The factories BELONG to the
owners. It wouldn&rsquo;t be RIGHT for us to take them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure they belong to the owners,&rdquo; Slim commented, as
he reached into his locker for his gloves. &ldquo;So do you. But
that&rsquo;s no reason you ALWAYS have to be a slave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m a slave you&rsquo;re a slave, too. You do the
same work I do, and you get the same pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this indisputable logic Slim replied, &ldquo;Yep. We&rsquo;re
all slaves. Wage slaves. Only difference between you and the rest of
us is that you LIKE it.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whaddaya mean &ndash; we&rsquo;re slaves?&rdquo; Breezy,
said, as he looked up from a list of teams for the big hockey pool.
&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no slave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway we&rsquo;re not slaves until they pass that slave
labor law,&rdquo; Shorty said, with his mouth full of a baloney
sandwich.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I was getting at,&rdquo; Slim began again, &ldquo;is
that this plant and all the machinery in it don&rsquo;t do the
capitalists a bit of good unless they have us to work it for them. We
have to be their slaves when you stop to think of it. And the only
way we can stop being their slaves, and work for ourselves, is to
kick them out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Scissorbill Sam said belligerently, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you know that widows and orphans own stock in this company? What do
you want to do? Kick them out in the streets?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, wait a minute, Slim,&rdquo; Pop Philliber set his
thermos jug down real quick. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fly off the
handle at Sam. Anyway that&rsquo;s a real good argument he&rsquo;s
got there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fellows looked at Scissorbill Sam. He was pleased. But he
looked a little bit self-conscious, because everybody could see that
Pop was getting wound up with an argument, too.</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;Slim here says that if you take the factories away from
the rich, you take their slaves away at the same time. But as
Scissorbill points out, you also take the slave away from some poor
widow that never done you any harm &ndash;,&rdquo; Pop lit his pipe
while he let the moral sink in.</I></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now just look at that widow. All her money is wrapped up in
that slave. Maybe just ten or fifteen thousand dollars in stock. It&rsquo;s
all she has in the world. Now just pretend that all the rest of us
here are slaves belonging to Eugene Grace, or some other rich and
fancy stockbroker. But poor Scissorbill there, he&rsquo;s a slave of
this nice old widow woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scissorbill tried to make out he wasn&rsquo;t paying much
attention. But we could all see he was.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Scissorbill and His Lady Slaveowner</h4>

<p class="fst">&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued Pop as he squinted into his
thermos bottle at nothing in particular, &ldquo;this here is what you
call a problem in ethics. It might be all right for all the rest of
us to kick our owners out, on account of their being mean and
no-account crooks that get real fat off&rsquo;n us. But you take the
sweet old lady slaveowner that lives off Scissorbill. Why he just
keeps her in crinkly dresses, a nice little cottage with a board walk
and roses, maybe a buck in the collection plate at church now and
then &ndash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s got a couple of pet cats and dogs, too,&rdquo;
Shorty added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mebbe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t supportin&rsquo; no pet cats and dogs!&rdquo;
Scissorbill shouted. He was getting a little mad.</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;Well if you&rsquo;re gonna be a slave for a nice old
widow you got to work for her pets, too,&rdquo; Pop said, with an air
of finality, &ldquo;I guess you just got to take the bad with the
good, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</I></p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyhow,&rdquo; the old boy went on, &ldquo;if the majority
of the boys figure this poor woman hadn&rsquo;t ought to lose her
slave, just on account of a little Socialism or something, well you
can let Scissorbill go right on being her slave. That&rsquo;s fair
enough, ain&rsquo;t it, Sam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the bosses&rsquo; man walked out in a huff, while everybody
laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that I think of it,&rdquo; Shorty said, &ldquo;My old
lady was a widow. She never had time for rose gardens and stuff like
that, though. She worked ten and twelve hours a day at the laundry to
keep us kids in school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course if you was to get technical, now,&rdquo; Pop said
with a little sigh, &ldquo;you might say there&rsquo;s quite a few
poor widows in this country that don&rsquo;t have any ten or fifteen
thousand dollars worth of stock in this company.&rdquo;</p>

<p><I>Slim clenched his teeth. And without opening them very much he
said, &ldquo;For every widow who gets a cut on the profits, they mail
the lousy five hundred dollar insurance to twenty new widows right in
this town. And they&rsquo;re making thousands and thousands of widows
in this war that they&rsquo;ll kick out on the streets when it&rsquo;s
all over. It&rsquo;s THEM that&rsquo;s robbing widows and orphans.
And it&rsquo;s US that&rsquo;s going to put a stop to it.&rdquo;</I></p>
