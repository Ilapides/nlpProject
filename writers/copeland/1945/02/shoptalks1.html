<p class="fst">&ldquo;Why you have socialism right now, and what good does it
do?&rdquo; said Scissorbill Sam (the bosses&rsquo; man).</p>

<p>Everybody looked surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at this here War Production Board and War Manpower
Commission. The WPB tells the corporations how much to produce. The
OPA tells &rsquo;em how much to charge for it. And the War Manpower
Commission tells everybody where to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So what?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;So what? That&rsquo;s regulation, ain&rsquo;t it? That&rsquo;s
planned production, ain&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s Socialism, that&rsquo;s
what!&rdquo;</I></p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, Scissorbill,&rdquo; said Slim, weighing his
words, &ldquo;Sometimes I think you missed your calling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah?,&rdquo; muttered Sam distrustfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should be writing editorials for the big newspapers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t write them,&rdquo; Scissorbill replied
with a pleased and hopeful note in his voice, &ldquo;but I read them
carefully every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same difference,&rdquo; said Slim.</p>

<p>While Scissorbill was chewing on that, Shorty asked, &ldquo;How
about that, Slim? I know we want to throw the War Manpower Commission
out because they&rsquo;re part of the labor freezing outfit. But
other boards help keep prices down and plan production. Wouldn&rsquo;t
we keep them in if we had a labor government?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;We might have a word like &lsquo;Production,&rsquo; or
even &lsquo;Price Administration&rsquo; at the beginning. But that&rsquo;s
all that might be the same &ndash; just the name. Everything else
would be different. The main difference would be that our boards will
work.</I></p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think this capitalist board works, do you?
Look at the way they had all those lay-offs in aircraft and
small-arms factories a little while ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. And now they want a labor draft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And look how they take some of the people back to work. At
less wages than ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But that isn&rsquo;t all,&rdquo; said Slim. &ldquo;Naturally
these companies are all trying to chisel on our wages and cut us down
to the bone. But that&rsquo;s just one reason why you see crowds of
working people going out of one factory &ndash; working in another
one for three or four weeks &ndash; or wandering around the streets &ndash;
then back in the first one &ndash; then out on their ear again. Don&rsquo;t
forget, the War Production Board itself is telling the companies to
do this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the companies do it against their will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not by a long shot, Breezy. The War Production Board is
made up of a lot of agents of different big companies. My point is
that they can&rsquo;t plan production. Their own system prevents
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; said Scissorbill, disapprovingly,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to give the impression the WPB is run by
Big Business.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Slim sarcastically. &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t want to give you the wrong idea. Maybe us working
stiffs are running it. But anyway it comes out like this: a few
months ago WPB gives Big Business, and only Big Business, the green
light to change over to peace-time production.&rdquo;</I></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s what started the big lay-offs, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And smaller outfits couldn&rsquo;t get any materials for
peace-time work for another year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of them can&rsquo;t even get materials for war work
right now&rsquo;. Why I know a guy &ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people thrown out of work,&rdquo; continued Slim, &ldquo;just
signed up for unemployment. insurance because the WPB. couldn&rsquo;t
put &rsquo;em back to work. Then the war got under way all over
again, and most people got back to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a few pay-cuts, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;Of course. And it just goes to show that the only thing
that&rsquo;s making this screwy system work nowadays is war. And they
can&rsquo;t even plan production right for their own war. What the
hell are they going to do in peace-time?</I></p>

<p>&ldquo;The War Production Board,&rdquo; Slim went on &ldquo;is a
planning board, all right. What does it plan ? &ndash; It plans how
Big Business can make the most money possible and give the working
people the business. It plans how to choke off smaller companies and
drive them to the wall in the changeover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now Scissorbill Sam says that is a socialistic set-up. Well
that&rsquo;s the way the big manufacturers feel too. They didn&rsquo;t
even want to hear a little squawk out of the War Production Board, or
any other board, if they decide to make a few extra bucks on ships
that break in two in cold water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They agree to have the board &ndash; like you agree to let
a dentist pull your tooth &ndash; because you have to. But they kick
like hell about the few restrictions they have to accept once in a
while. And they call that Socialistic. They&rsquo;re only raking in
twice the shekels they did in the last war &ndash; but they figure
it&rsquo;s a big enough war to rate four times as much profit.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;You know &ndash;&rdquo; said Shorty, &ldquo;if we were
running things ourselves I should think it would be pretty simple to
make a production board work. The fellows in each plant would want
the other plant to produce a lot. And what damn fool would want to
make things so fast that they broke in two? Why our production board
could make things go right without half trying.&rdquo;</I></p>

<p>&ldquo;If I was running a real socialistic shebang,&rdquo; boasted
Breezy suddenly, &ldquo;and they tried to make stuff that killed our
own boys, I&rsquo;d cut their hearts out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the right idea,&rdquo; said Shorty.</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Slim said, &ldquo;except that Breezy
wouldn&rsquo;t be running it. We all would. And nobody&rsquo;d get a
chance to pull stuff like that even if they wanted to. Anyway, we&rsquo;ll
do a lot worse than cut their hearts out. We&rsquo;ll make &rsquo;em
go to work.&rdquo;</I></p>
