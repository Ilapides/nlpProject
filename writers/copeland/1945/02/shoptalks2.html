<p class="fst">&ldquo;Just as long as people want to have power, you&rsquo;re
going to have wars and trouble,&rdquo; somebody said the other day.</p>

<p>Some crazy guy with a lust for power and a yen to play soldier
crops up every generation or so and gets millions of poor guys killed
off who never wanted to play soldier at all ... <I>That&rsquo;s the
way the capitalist books and newspapers explain things. And naturally
most people believe it&rsquo;s really so.</I></p>

<p>But it stands to reason that very few tyrants are as strong as,
say, two men together. And you never heard of ONE that could stand up
to ten men at once. Yet it takes a hell of a lot more than ten strong
men to overthrow a weakest tyrant.</p>

<p>Take the old superintendent of the Open Hearth &ndash; the one
they had three or four years ago. He was hell on wheels. Took away
the benches, took down the canopy the fellows had fixed up on the
other side of the furnace floor to keep the rain and snow off them.
He&rsquo;d have a man sent back home for coming out on the floor five
minutes late for his turn. There was a tyrant for you.</p>

<p>The whole union kept up a running fight for months to break that
guy. They complained to every big shot they could. They had
&ldquo;take-it-easy&rdquo; weeks, and regular slowdowns, too. Finally
when the second and third helpers just refused to work on the floor
at all, and stayed in the labor gang, the company &ldquo;looked into
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The result was that a different superintendent was put in and the
other slave-driver was transferred. Naturally he got better pay in
the new place where he pulled the same business, while the new super
was a young guy &ndash; just promoted. Probably got lower pay than
the old one.</p>

<p><I>But whom was the whole union fighting? Was it just an ornery,
cantankerous old man who wanted to have his own way? Or was it the
COMPANY &ndash; the association of millionaires who PROFITED by his
use of power?</I></p>

<p>You can be power-drunk all your life. But if you don&rsquo;t tie
up with the bunch that want you in power to protect their interests,
about all you can do is twiddle your thumbs, or read the comic books
and intoxicate yourself with the deeds of &ldquo;Superman&rdquo; and
his pals.</p>

<p>In their movie <I>Lost in a Harem</I>, Abbott and Costello run up
against a dirty king who&rsquo;s a tyrant for fair. And do you know
how he does it? He hypnotizes everybody in the kingdom (including
Tommy Dorsey and his band) with some kind of magic ring. That sounds
pretty silly.</p>

<p>And yet, when you come to think of it, some explanations of
Hitler&rsquo;s powers might have come out of the same wacky scenario
writer&rsquo;s hand. According to the stuff you read and hear, this
Hitler is some kind of nine-day wonder in reverse. He reportedly
wields hypnotic power over people: Roosevelt and Churchill may be
superheroes. But Hitler&rsquo;s a super-villain. And instead of
having a ring to put people to sleep, they have something better.
They are supposed to have people all willing to be hypnotized anyway
because they&rsquo;re such dopes!</p>

<p>But what does Hitler DO when he uses all this super-power of his?
Does he put extra benches on furnace floors? Does he command the
capitalists to raise workers&rsquo; wages? Does he command them to
pay time-and-a-half, and double time? Not on your life. He doesn&rsquo;t,
because he CAN&rsquo;T.</p>

<p>No, the magic of the fascist tyrant&rsquo;s power works only in
one direction. Against the working people. Hitler has a lust for
power, all right. But he and his gang are working for the association
of German millionaires who PROFIT from this power. The minute there&rsquo;s
no more profit, out he&rsquo;ll go, while they try to use some other
handy tyrants (like Allied generals) to keep the German workers down.</p>

<p>No single individual really rules either Germany or America. A
CLASS rules. The capitalist class. If they can get some super
boy-scout to front for them, so much the better &ndash; for them.
They can put forward these tyrants because, like all previous class
rule, capitalist rule is the rule of a tiny minority, based on the
foundations of scarcity economy. <I>The only way a minority has or
can or ever did rule over the majority is by supplementing brute
force with deception, lies and legends &ndash; especially centered
round tyrants, &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; and fascist alike.</I> That
is why real democracy is out for capitalism just as it was excluded
for feudalism and slavery.</p>

<p>When we take over the industries, our class, THE WORKING CLASS,
will rule. Then we&rsquo;ll have real democracy, workers&rsquo;
democracy. We working people will be running things in our own
interests. So naturally we will train as many as possible for genuine
leadership. There will be no lifetime presidents or dictators under
our system, for the simple reason that we&rsquo;ll be constantly
getting better leaders to take care of the interests of those who
will then PROFIT from the power &ndash; the WORKING PEOPLE
themselves.</p>
