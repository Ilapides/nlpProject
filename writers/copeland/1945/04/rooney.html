<p class="fst">I see by the papers that soldier Mickey Rooney arrived in Paris on March 23, after performing for 3 months in the Roer River sector. And now all the soldiers are happy.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;I performed in barns and bomb-ruined houses,&rdquo; Mickey told a reporter. &ldquo;But what does it matter as long as the GIs are happy?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The way I get it is that America&rsquo;s &ldquo;bad boy&rdquo; usually has an easy chair near the cameras, and a plush-lined dressing room on roller skates to relax in. So he had a pretty tough time pepping up the boys&rsquo; morale under such adverse conditions.</p>

<p>But what the hell! He&rsquo;s a good scout, isn&rsquo;t he? He&rsquo;ll make the best of a bomb-ruined house! Maybe the people who used to live in it could learn a lesson by his spartan example. Maybe they&rsquo;ll learn to get along without running water and a roof, too.</p>

<p>Maybe. But they won&rsquo;t be able to go to Paris and relax after a few weeks of it, though.</p>

<p>Maybe he&rsquo;s right about the soldiers being happy, too. But it looks to me like the happiness of the steelworkers on a Saturday night. They&rsquo;re so glad to be out of the mess and sweat for a few hours, and so worried about going back to it again &ndash; they try to forget with a drink and a good laugh.</p>
