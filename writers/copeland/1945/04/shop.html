<p class="fst">&ldquo;Pop, you goose-greased son of a sea serpent,&rdquo; said Breezy, who had come in a little high. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you recognize your old friends any more?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last time I recognized you on a Saturday afternoon I had to buy you two drinks,&rdquo; Pop growled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you admit it! What do you fellows think about that? Here&rsquo;s a man I thought was a friend of mine. That&rsquo;s life for you,&rdquo; he said tragically, slapping his side like Schnozzle Durante. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m big-hearted. When I see you in this condition, Pop, I&rsquo;ll come right over to your side of the road and buy you three more drinks. How do you like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to buy me no drinks, Breezy. You save your money for you old age. You can&rsquo;t work when you&rsquo;re old,&rdquo; Pop said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play young and work old. That&rsquo;s the only way,&rdquo; Breezy insisted. &ldquo;How&rsquo;m I gonna play when I&rsquo;m old and dried up like you? &ndash; Anyway I&rsquo;m gonna live on the interest when I&rsquo;m sixty-five.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What interest?&rdquo; asked one of the first-shift boys who was washing up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why my old-age benefit fund. What do you think? I been paying in on it for nine years now. Look at Pop there. He&rsquo;s a two income man. Forty bucks a week from the company, and a pension from the government to boot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got eight years to go, sweeping and hooking for guys like you before I get that royal pension, Mister Breezy.&rdquo; Pop was sort of huffy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight years! Don&rsquo;t you try to tell this gang you&rsquo;re only fifty-seven years old, Pop! You&rsquo;re seventy-seven if you&rsquo;re a day.&rdquo; Breezy reconsidered &ndash; &ldquo;I bet you&rsquo;re eighty-seven. Say, fellows, Pop&rsquo;s the guy to see if you want to borrow money. Pop&rsquo;s got all that pension dough salted away somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a minute some of the fellows looked at Pop as if they almost believed it. Then Breezy asked everybody in general, &ldquo;Say, how much is that pension anyhow &ndash; anybody know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody knew. But we were all thinking &ndash; just like Breezy would have been thinking if he hadn&rsquo;t been under the weather, &ldquo;Gee, is Pop only fifty-seven? With all his wrinkles and rheumatism he really could pass for seventy-seven.&rdquo; And each one of us thought, &ldquo;Will I be as old as that when I&rsquo;m fifty-seven? Why hell &ndash; I might never live to be old enough to collect that pension.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Kind of &ldquo;Security&rdquo; Capitalism Gives</h4>

<p class="fst">&ldquo;I guess most of you guys are too young to be interested,&rdquo; Pop said, pretending he wasn&rsquo;t very much interested himself, &ldquo;But the highest amount anybody can possibly get is eighty-five dollars a month. The average is about thirty-six dollars. I&rsquo;ll beat the present average, though, on account of the eight more years I&rsquo;ll be paying in &ndash; if I live to be sixty-five.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Boy, isn&rsquo;t that beautiful? Pop will get about ten bucks a week in his old age. A hell of a lot of &ldquo;playing&rdquo; he&rsquo;s going to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes sir, you fellows will be sweating your heads off eight years from now,&rdquo; Pop went on, as he opened his laundry and tied up his dirty overalls into a small bundle. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll be sitting back drawing down that 10 smackers a week.&rdquo; And being a thoughtful sort of cuss, he couldn&rsquo;t help but add after a second or so &ndash; &ldquo;mebbe.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Play young and work old&rdquo; Breezy said. But how can you work when you&rsquo;re old. The plant doesn&rsquo;t want you. They&rsquo;ll throw Pop on the scrap heap one of these days. And you don&rsquo;t have the money to play when you&rsquo;re young, unless you neglect those you really want to take care of.</em></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the capitalist system for you. That&rsquo;s capitalism and the kind of security it gives you &ndash; with money you yourself fork over.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s Breezy going to do? Or anybody else for that matter? Butt his head up against the wall and wind up on the skids before his time?</p>

<p><em>There&rsquo;s only one thing we can do. Organize our forces to overthrow the whole rotten system. We don&rsquo;t want their starvation bread when we&rsquo;re old. We want a decent workingman&rsquo;s society, where a man fifty to sixty years old can make his own choice to keep on working, or take it easy, AT THE SAME GOOD PAY EITHER WAY. That&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;ll fix things under socialism.</em></p>
