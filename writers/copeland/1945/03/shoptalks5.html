<p class="fst">Pile-it-high Patterson, that unappreciated genius of production, was over by the spot welder talking to Marjorie, and as usual, piling it high.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking off a little early today, Marge&rdquo; said he. From the tone of his voice you&rsquo;d have thought the whole shop would go down if Pile-it-high didn&rsquo;t give it every moment of his attention.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Marjorie asked, trying to be polite. She hadn&rsquo;t been, around too long. But she knew enough to duck when Patterson started slinging the bull. Still, it gave her a little excuse to dog the job a few minutes, letting him talk to her.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have a golf engagement this afternoon. I suppose you noticed my golf clubs in the time office.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course she noticed. Everybody in the shop had noticed. Pile-it-high had put them right where you couldn&rsquo;t help but notice them when you rang in on a job. And we were all making wisecracks about them. &ldquo;First sign of spring&rdquo; and all that. But Marge wanted to string him along some &ndash; so she let on she didn&rsquo;t happen to see them.</p>

<p>Any ordinary guy wouldn&rsquo;t have kept trying to impress a girl when she didn&rsquo;t want to be impressed. But Pile-it-high was not ordinary. He was made of different stuff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bet you can&rsquo;t guess who I have the golf engagement with Marge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With Rita Hayworth and Donald Duck, huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha,&rdquo; he laughed a little weakly. &ldquo;As a matter of fact &ndash;&rdquo; he cleared his throat, and rustled his sheaf of important papers &ndash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out with the Superintendent to the Park Crest Club.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Marjorie didn&rsquo;t fall into a faint at this exciting news. So Pile-it-high added his biggest bombshell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give his daughter a little golf lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No kidding?&rdquo; said Marge without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you see I&rsquo;ve been at it quite a while. Had a chance to be a professional at the Happy Valley when the war came. But I-ah-felt my career was here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, how old is this daughter of old sourpuss?&rdquo; Marge asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Patterson&rsquo;s face got red and he tried to be a little nonchalant when he said, &ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t know. About twenty.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Making a Play for the Boss&rsquo;s Daughter</h4>

<p class="fst">&ldquo;Teaching her golf, huh? Giving all the girls around here the brush-off while you make a play for one boss&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo; (Pile-it-high figures he&rsquo;s quite a ladies&rsquo; man, and Marge was rubbing it in.) &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to go and marry the girl are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Patterson laughed his smooth, self-conscious laugh, and pulled in his pot belly a little. &ldquo;Oh, no. Of course it&rsquo;s nothing like that,&rdquo; he said with a sort of pooh-pooh in his voice. After all, he was only trying to give the girls in the shop an insight into his true charm. He didn&rsquo;t want to give them the impression he was going to be taken out of circulation for good.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;Seriously, though, Marge, it isn&rsquo;t a laughing matter. You know Taylor C. Wilkins himself got to be vice-president that way. He married the president&rsquo;s daughter. You&rsquo;d be surprised at the number of the big executives who got their start that way. And even if they don&rsquo;t get a big position, it&rsquo;s a lifetime job, you know.&rdquo; There was real awe in his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so!&rdquo; Marge exclaimed. &ldquo;Well say I better finish spotting these brackets.&rdquo; And she said to herself, &ldquo;Can you imagine that? That little four-flushing pipsqueak thinks he&rsquo;s going to marry Miss Millionbucks and be a big time four-flusher for the rest of his life. Well, it takes all kinds of people to make a world, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Pile-it-high is a pathetic sort of four-flusher, though. Running around shining the shoes of the higher-ups like he does, always keeping his eye on the main chance.</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t realize he lacks sophistication, poise, polish, &ldquo;education&rdquo; to marry Miss Millionbucks. He hasn&rsquo;t guzzled enough cocktails or seen enough dog-races to make this grade, poor fellow.</p>

<p><em>It is done sometimes, you know. Richer girls do occasionally marry up-and-coming young executives like Pile-it-high. Yes, if you&rsquo;re a smooth, smart young fellow, who&rsquo;s been to the &ldquo;right&rdquo; college and knows the &ldquo;right&rdquo; people, maybe you can marry a boss&rsquo;s daughter and be set for life as a big-time &ldquo;Yes-Man.&rdquo; Quite a future before you under the capitalist system.</em></p>

<p>But what a future ... for a MAN!</p>
