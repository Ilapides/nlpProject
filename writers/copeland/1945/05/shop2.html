<p class="fst">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad,&rdquo; said Scissorbill Sam (the bosses&rsquo; man), &ldquo;when all these here women are out of the shop. They belong in the kitchen, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Pop after a well-aimed spit of coffee juice at the trash box. &ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t know. &rsquo;Course babies is better off with women takin&rsquo; care of &rsquo;em. But whether women is better off that way is a moot question. I&rsquo;ve heard tell there&rsquo;s an awful lot of women folk go crazy every year just from listenin&rsquo; to babies cry all day long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact &rdquo; said old George, the machinist, &ldquo;I bet babies would be just as well off with men to take care of them as women. That is,&rdquo; he added hastily, as the fellows started to laugh, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re gonna feed them with a bottle. Only reason a man&rsquo;s not handy at that stuff is that he works such long hours away from home that ...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; hollered Breezy. &ldquo;Wait a second! I don&rsquo;t care if I&rsquo;m laid off for the whole year. You won&rsquo;t see Breezy changing diapers and pouring powder down the kid&rsquo;s back. That&rsquo;ll be the day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t trying to say who&rsquo;s the best dydee pinner &ndash; man or woman. Guess I&rsquo;d bet on the woman, myself.&rdquo; Pop paused a moment, sort of to apologize for admitting a point of superiority in women. &ldquo;But it don&rsquo;t seem reasonable for women to have to do a job that some of them go crazy at. And most of them go down hill somethin&rsquo; awful after raising three or four babies.&rdquo; Pop waited for somebody to contradict him. But how could anybody?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t only the squallin&rsquo;, either. It&rsquo;s the awful mischief they get into. That&rsquo;s what runs a body down trailing after them when they&rsquo;re anywheres from one to three or four years old. A woman looks pretty old in a few years.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What Can You Do About It?</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s the way it is. But what are you going to do?&rdquo; said Tony glumly.</em></p>

<p>The way he said it he didn&rsquo;t expect any answer. But Pop was wound up pretty well that day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell you what I&rsquo;d do if it was me,&rdquo; Pop said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d use a little sense and let women handle little tykes that were good at it. Women that liked it. Maybe have ten or fifteen youngsters in a real nice day nursery like the rich people have. Only do it all over the country. Then a woman would have a little time to bring up her youngsters the way she wanted to. Read them bed-time stories and things like that instead of boxing their ears all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aah, put away the pipe,&rdquo; Breezy razzed the old man. &ldquo;Nobody can afford that ritzy line of stuff not if they work for Bethlehem Steel!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Not today they can&rsquo;t. But if it&rsquo;s not too good for the rich,&rdquo; said Pop stubbornly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not too good for the poor.&rdquo;</em></p>
