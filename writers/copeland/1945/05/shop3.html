<h2>V. Grey</h2>

<h1>Shop Talks on Socialism</h1>

<h3>(19 May 1945)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1945/index.htm#m45_20" target="new">Vol.&#160;IX No.&#160;20</a>, 19 May 1945, p.&nbsp;6.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="fst">Pile-It-High Patterson was talking to Hallory, the foreman, today (sort of one bull-shooter to another). He said, &ldquo;I see the aircraft plants have been laying off gradually for several months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Hallory said, &ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s a good thing, too. If they laid everybody off at once when the war with Japan ends, it would be a terrible calamity. It&rsquo;s a great boon to have it this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You see Hallory must have read the editorial in yesterday&rsquo;s paper. Same with Pile-It-High Patterson. That editorial said it was a boon too. When those two birds haven&rsquo;t got any stuff of their own to shovel and pile, they get somebody else&rsquo;s out of the newspapers.</p>

<p><em>Maybe they have a point at that, though. When you stop to think of it, maybe it is a great boon to be laid off &ldquo;gradually&rdquo; instead of suddenly. You see, if you get laid off on the same day as five or ten thousand other people, why that&rsquo;s kind of sudden. In fact, it&rsquo;s a calamity.</em></p>

<p>But if you get laid off all by yourself, or with only a couple hundred other lucky people, it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;boon.&rdquo; (A boon, they tell me, is something a big shot gives you for nothing.)<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Sounds Pretty Good, Doesn&rsquo;t It?</h4>

<p class="fst">It&rsquo;s much better, after all, to get laid off now, isn&rsquo;t it? You wouldn&rsquo;t want to get slapped in the face with a lay-off right in the middle of that big victory celebration the bosses will be having, would you?</p>

<p>By getting laid-off <em>now</em>, you get more time to get used to the idea and adjust yourself to post-war conditions. Not only that. Maybe you&rsquo;ve been making a dollar and a quarter an hour over at aircraft. And if you get laid off soon enough you might get in a couple of months over to <em>our</em> shop, or on the furnaces. You get 78 cents an hour and <em>up</em> &ndash; up to about 88 cents ... You&rsquo;ll get used to lower wages quicker that way, too.</p>

<p><em>That&rsquo;s a break, isn&rsquo;t it? And you might have three or four weeks between jobs, too &ndash; just enough not to collect on unemployment insurance. That ought to help a guy get back into the old harness.</em></p>

<p>So Pile-It-High Patterson sighs &ndash; you know, just as though all. the problems of gouging Bethlehem&rsquo;s 38 million dollars average profits out of the workers, were on his shoulders alone. He sighs and says, &ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll have some of those aircraft workers over here. That means an awful lot more paper work for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Hallory says, &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be hard to handle, too. One thing, at least, the union can&rsquo;t say anything for 30 days. Maybe they&rsquo;ll be out by then.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Sounds pretty good, doesn&rsquo;t it?</em></p>
