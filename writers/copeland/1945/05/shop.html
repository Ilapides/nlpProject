<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1945/index.htm#m45_18" target="new">Vol.&#160;IX No.&#160;18</a>, 5 May 1945, p.&nbsp;6.<br />

<p class="fst">Sometimes you hear somebody say, &ldquo;These accidents are the fellows&rsquo; own fault.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s not only Scissorbill Sam (the bosses&rsquo; man) who says it, either. Shorty said it once, and Breezy makes cracks like that too.</p>

<p>At the last safety meeting the foreman said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing as an accident.&rdquo; Everything is carelessness, he argued. And he mentioned how a girl and a fellow had both hurt their hands in just the same way on the same machine. They both wiped the shavings off a drill-press table with one hand while they were bringing the drill down with the other.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no excuse for that, the foreman said. They had a stick to clean off the shavings with. They didn&rsquo;t need to use their hands and get hurt. Of course the, company never got around to installing an air line to blow the table clean. But it&rsquo;s no trouble to pick up a stick, as the foreman says. You only have to do it once every three and a half seconds.</p>

<p>Well, maybe there isn&rsquo;t any excuse. Maybe these people did it on purpose. Maybe they wanted to see what it felt like to tear a hole in their hand. Maybe they were so dumb they thought it would be a big enough accident so they could get compensation and retire. &ndash; And maybe not.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a funny thing. But fellows and girls have been running that drill-press ever since it was put in the shop two and a half years ago, and nothing happened to them. But all of a sudden there are two accidents in a row. How come?<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Does the Law of Averages Explain It?</h4>

<p class="fst">Well, maybe it was the law of averages. Mathematicians figure it out by the law of chances, or something. They figure that a drill-press has one accident a year in its system. So if two years go by without an accident, there are two accidents coming up, you know. The same way they figure if you flip a coin a thousand times it will come down heads 500 times. But maybe not exactly 500 times in a row &ndash; as every bettor knows.</p>

<p><em>You never can tell. The law of averages might explain it all. But it&rsquo;s too bad the law got enforced just when they started to make money on the job.</em></p>

<p>Oh yes, I forgot to mention that angle, didn&rsquo;t I? The first two years and five months the drill-press was only used for shop repair work and other day-work jobs. But for the last couple of weeks the operators have been on steady PIECE-WORK on the drill.</p>

<p>NOW they can make nine-fifty a day! Maybe ten bucks if. they get good stock and quick crane service. Of course they work four or five times FASTER than day-work to get the dough. But hell, that&rsquo;s piece-work, isn&rsquo;t it? .</p>

<p><em>Take a girl who got 78 cents an hour yesterday on a clean-up job. She may have run the drill a couple of times before for 81 cents an hour. Now there&rsquo;s a piece-work job. The boss gives her a break, and puts her on the drill. She has the chance of making a dollar and a quarter an hour. All she has to do is work four or five times harder and faster.</em></p>

<p>And maybe that&rsquo;s why she decided to drill a hole in her hand, and push a broom for the rest of the month.</p>
