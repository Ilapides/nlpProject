<p class="fst">Dear Comrades:</p>

<p class="fst">We were taken completely by surprise as we had no information before your statement came to the different comrades in the mail last week. This was quickly followed by a letter from the &#8220;cleansed&#8221; minority boasting of their part in the shameful expos&#233;.</p>

<p>Almost all of OUR comrades feel that here at last is the key to the riddle that we have been trying to understand for so many years. That is, we too have come to realise during the time of the Congress that international politics were being played with us while we were still attempting to outsmart these bureaucrats within the confines of our own little Party.</p>

<p>We have EVERY important comrade of the old opposition with us. They have accepted the slogan, &#8220;Against the Bureaucrats&#8221;, as a slogan of action.</p>

<p>The comrades realize that this is not the ordinary Party fight and that all comrades who take a position now of Opposition will in all probability find themselves confronted with a campaign of the most unjust slander and vilification. Most of us understand that there will be those who cannot understand the pressure and who will desert. We also know that with the correct line we will be able to strengthen our force&#8217;s by bringing over to us those elements that are honest and politically alert, those with that old fighting heart.</p>
