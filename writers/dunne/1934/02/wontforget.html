<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1934/index.htm#tm34_09" target="new">Vol. VII No. 9</a>, 24 February 1934, p.&#160;2.<br />

<p class="fst">Those pickets who dumped two seven-ton loads in front of North Western Yard No.&#160;1 on the first morning of the Strike:<br />
The action that warned the rest of the Companies what to expect.</p>

<h4>* * * * *</h4>

<p class="fst">That 3 hour running fight up West Broadway to keep a load of coal from being delivered to ex-Sheriff Brown&#8217;s greenhouse.</p>

<h4>* * * * *</h4>

<p class="fst">That fighting young worker who seized a cop by the throat and made him apologize (before the crowd) for calling him a vile name.</p>

<h4>* * * * *</h4>

<p class="fst">That in this Strike, mass picketing became a reality &#8211; not an empty slogan.</p>

<h4>* * * * *</h4>

<p class="fst">The sight of a hall full of sleepy men jumping to their feet, shaking the sleep from their eyes, responding eagerly to the never ending demands &#8211; ten pickets here! twenty pickets there!</p>

<h4>* * * * *</h4>

<p class="fst">The steady line of workers flocking up to join the Union &#8211; then leaving to swell the picket lines.</p>

<h4>* * * * *</h4>

<p class="fst">The fact that few &#8211; very few, farmers tried to scab by selling wood for easy cash although wood is plentiful &#8211; and the farmers needed the money.</p>

<h4>* * * * *</h4>

<p class="fst">The cheer that went up from the coal workers when they learned that the Ice Wagon Drivers, in spite of their officials, had decided to go out in sympathy.</p>

<h4>* * * * *</h4>

<p class="fst">The militant young pickets who in the face of pistol fire and five squad cars full of cops &#8211; dumped that load of coal.</p>

<h4>* * * * *</h4>

<p class="fst">That the second and the third night of the Strike &#8211; found the fuel oil drivers responding to the pickets&#8217; demands for &#8220;no fuel deliveries&#8221;. Many drivers refused to work.</p>

<h4>* * * * *</h4>

<p class="fst">The fact: That the entire police force backed the bosses, but that all the coal that filtered through the picket lines, could have been delivered by ONE Union DRIVER in two hours.</p>

<h4>* * * * *</h4>

<p class="fst">That the Strike was so effective after the first day &#8211; it required a Doctor&#8217;s prescription to get coal through the lines &#8211; in case of sickness.</p>

<h4>* * * * *</h4>

<p class="fst">That the Union agreement to let Welfare Coal go, the first day &#8211; was violated by any number of greedy coal owners &#8211; It was banned after that because of this double-crossing.</p>

<h4>* * * * *</h4>

<p class="fst">That the bosses had to swallow their insolent slander that, &#8220;the men can&#8217;t organize&#8221;, &#8220;they won&#8217;t stick&#8221; &#8211; they saw UNION organisation &#8211; they saw them STICK &#8211; More than that, they saw them FIGHT.</p>
