<p class="fst">Dear Comrades:</p>

<p class="fst">Bill Simons was here last night, gave a most miserable speech to about 60 people and the meeting was closed at 10:30 without discussion. Through questions we forced him to say that <em>any</em> organization of workers fighting: imperialism would be allowed to join the A.A.A.I.L. We will affiliate to the League, although we know what will be tried in spite of Bill&#8217;s statement.</p>

<p>We have a new strike in the linseed oil industry &#8211; a big industry here &#8211; which is taking up a lot of our time. Only a few workers involved at present, but we are trying to weld into shape, out of those striking, a group which can be used for organization work in other plants. Slow work, lots of patience required, raw workers, but real fellows who will, under proper guidance, help to move mountains.</p>

<p>The Party here, with Clem Forsen as political leader, could hardly be more pitiful. This fellow who has <em>never</em> understood where he was going, or in fact why he was in the Party. Forsen &#8211; who two years ago came to us and said that he was disillusioned and discouraged and offered as the solution that &#8220;he leave the Party&#8221;. We spoke with him then as a young comrade, and finally prevailed upon him to stay in the Y.W.L. It is now plain to us that he never stopped upon the downward path. It should be recorded that he was the &#8220;Party representative&#8221; in the I.L.D. Gastonia conference, who led the attack upon us, made a 50 minute speech against us and then opposed the motion to grant me 5 minutes to state our position. He was chairman at last night&#8217;s anti-imperialist meeting &#8211; positively shameful. Bill S. avoided us when the meeting was ever; he only pulled down his hat over his eyes and rushed out past us into the night!</p>

<p>The <strong>Militant</strong> continues to be a joy and inspiration. Tremendous obstacle to the betrayers of Lenin&#8217;s Party &#8211; their work is tough under the glare of our exposure.</p>
