<p class="fst"><strong>New Cycle in Asia</strong><br/>
edited with an Introduction and Notes by Harold R. Isaacs<br/>
<em>Macmillan Co., New York, 212&nbsp;pp., $3.00</em></p>

<p class="fst">The end of the war precipitated a series of events in the Far East
and colonial world whose end is far from attained and whose historic
significance is yet undetermined. The end of the Japanese empire,
destroyed in war, occurred simultaneously with and partly helped
along the end of the British, French and Dutch empires, at least in
their familiar form.</p>

<p>This book, ably edited by Harold R. Isaacs, contains the more
important selected documents on major developments in the Far East
from 1943 to 1947. As source material for future studies, these notes
and documents are of great value, particularly since the trend of
modern imperialist diplomacy &#8211; in view of the acuteness of
presentday conflicts &#8211; has been toward clearer, more open
expressions of opinions and interests.</p>

<p>These documents deal with the defeat of Japan, the entire
evolution of American post-war policy toward China, the struggle
between the two great rivals over Korea, the Philippines, the
development of the final position on India&#8217;s partition, the framing
of Burma&#8217;s new position with respect to Britain, and the important
documents relating to the colonial wars in Indo-China and Indonesia.</p>

<p>The fact that these documents have been brought together, with
explanatory notes, is an achievement in itself. The larger problem of
an overall analysis of the new colonial systems, and the still more
complex problem of interpreting the new situation through Marxist
revolutionary colonial theory (above all, the adaptation of Trotsky&#8217;s
theory of the permanent revolution as applied to the colonial world)
&#8211; these problems must now be tackled.</p>
