<p class="fst"><strong>Germany: What Now?</strong><br/>
by Joachim Joesten<br/>
<em>Ziff-Davis, New York 1948, 331&nbsp;pp., $3.75.</em></p>

<p class="fst">For those who want a good deal of factual information and data
about post-war Germany, this study has a definite value. Written in a
rather dry and academic style, it contains enormous quantities of raw
factual material dealing with the new constitutional setup in the
various zones and states of Germany, a chronicle-like survey of the
various political parties, and a general description of the economic
systems prevailing in the four zones.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting part of the book consists in the
account of the various political parties and their present heads.
Joesten gives us a brief sketch of each leader, with some telling
sidelights on his career and political philosophy, including such men
as Pieck, Schumacher and Kaiser, to mention the most important. In
addition, there is much data on the results of the elections that
have been held up to now.</p>

<p>For those anxious to get a factual picture of Germany as it is
today, battered and split, this book will provide at least a partial
answer. The description of the new setup is exhaustive in its detail.
Yet this reviewer ventures the opinion that the reader will not have
a real picture of the new Germany. He will have touched the surface
and perhaps grasped its form, but the book completely fails to
penetrate below the superficial. It utterly lacks the &#8220;feel&#8221;
(most important for the understanding) of this land of utter misery.
There is nothing of the hunger and ruin, the spiritual and political
regression, the confusion and fear without end, the sense of
hopelessness and a future without future, that constitutes the real
Germany. The author is a good collector of data, which he digests in
popular and readable form, but not much else.</p>

<p>One of the interesting, if forgotten, documents he has dug up is
<em>Proclamation No.&nbsp;2</em> (August 13, 1945) of the Allied
Control Council. This document, signed by Zhukov, Eisenhower,
Montgomery and Koeltz, is now used by the Russians to justify their
seizure of Germanys assets, both industrial and human. It provides
that &#8220;... the German authorities will ... provide such labor,
personnel and specialists for use in Germany or elsewhere as the
Allied representatives may direct.&#8221;</p>

<p>Writing as a liberal, somewhat sympathetic to the
Social-Democratic viewpoint, the author assumes the continuation of
the occupation more or less in its present form, with the freezing
and stabilization of the present split between Eastern and Western
Germany. This is highly dubious, and undermines the prognostic nature
of the book, as contained in its title.</p>

<p>The limitations of the author&#8217;s method, for example, are
illustrated by his section on the Russians&#8217; land reform in their
zone of Germany. He states the facts, but even here he misses the
still more important fact of its bureaucratic fulfillment, together
with the Russian suppression of the spontaneous uprising of the
landless peasantry. And he neglects the problems arising out of this
land reform, as well as the now well-known fact that the Russians
collect substantial portions of the crops for shipment eastward.</p>

<p>Likewise, he sees nothing of the &#8220;national problem&#8221; (he links
all resistance tendencies to reactionary Prussian chauvinism) and
cannot see the larger and broader problems of Germany. The value of
the book, then, lies mainly in its useful and handy collection of information.</p>
