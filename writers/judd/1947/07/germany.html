<p class="quoteb">The situation here is desperate. Not only materially)
because of our not having any clothing and not enough to eat &#8211; but
above all from a spiritual point of view! The worst part of the whole
matter is, however, that every German man and woman who hated
injustice and who, on that account, was against Nazism and Militarism
&#8211; is today silent. They fought in word and deed against the Nazis
and believed that, after the overthrow of this evil, justice and real
freedom would stay. They did not flinch before prison and
concentration camp. They always pointed the way out to these deeds of
horror and injustice, etc. But where are these anti-fascists today?
They are no more to be found! They are in small. posts, disappointed
and depressed and must recognize that the Nazis are overthrown only
in name, that the Hitlerite spirit is triumphant, and by no means
only by way of the Germans! Everywhere one hears &#8211; <em>you must!</em>
Free expression of opinion? No. The Germans are afraid of everything,
of every word &#8211; of the CIC, secret service, Suret√© and GPU. And
this is precisely the most terrible thing &#8211; there is no difference
in the times to be noticed. On account of this, everyone is silent;
those who stood up for truth and right and those who quite obviously
were anti-fascist. Today the lukewarm, the mediocrities who
everywhere and always are up in front, today they speak. But these
men will not help us. (Extract from a letter from Germany)</p>

<h4>*</h4>

<p class="fst">In the <a href="../02/germany.html" target="new">first half of this series</a> of two articles on Germany today (Cf. February 1947 issue of <strong>The New International</strong>) we
described the breakdown of the Potsdam agreement, and the launching
of the struggle between the rival occupying powers for possession of
German resources and industrial capacity.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that this reversal in the prior trend to
de-industrialize Germany has, as yet, produced any noticeable or
notable results. The overall mass misery of the German people, in
all zones, continues as before, as the nation ends its second
post-war winter. The <strong>New York Times</strong> traveling correspondent,
Mrs. Anne H. McCormick, graphically reports the situation.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;A tiny trickle of heretofore unavailable goods &#8211;
<em>ersatz</em> soap, wire spectacle frames, wooden or composition
soles &#8211; s displayed, but it is the barter shop and bulletin boards
advertising articles for exchange that attract the crowds. Production
is beginning, say military government officers, but little evidence
of it appears on the counters of empty shops or in the motley
clothing the people wear ... Nothing new is being built.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;... the population looks worse and works less than
last year. They are thinner, yellower, slower-motioned, more
threadbare. The military government health figures tell a story of
decreasing resistance reflected in worried, pinched faces of women,
hollow-eyed men, weak-lunged children ... With few exceptions, the
whole population is hungry ...&#8221; (<strong>New York Times</strong>, October 20, 1946)</p>

<p class="fst">The Allied Central Economic Commission that sits in session at
Berlin set the average German living standard in March 1946 at
one-third below the pre-war level, or equal to the level of 1932 &#8211; a
year of intense economic depression. But this was a distant
objective, resting upon the assumption that the Potsdam accord would
be worked out. The reality is far different. The following chart
gives the <em>official</em> ration standards (daily) as of now. Even
these standards of slow starvation are mainly honored in the breach!</p>

<p class="fst">Aside from the dubious value of employing caloric intake as a
standard of actual food values, it is perfectly clear that this is a
diet of slow murder, particularly if prolonged for any period. It has
been in effect since October 15, 1946, and rests upon certain
assumptions not always fulfilled &#8211; namely, that the Russian zone
supplies its <em>entire</em> food supply by itself; that the British
and American zones supply respectively 600 calories and 900 calories
daily out of their own production. The Allies supposedly are to make
up the difference, but the constant food crises indicate this
systematically falls short of fulfillment.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the catastrophic long range effects of this deadly
diet of undernourishment are already visible. All those diseases that
take hold most easily in an organism weakened by lack of proper food
&#8211; tuberculosis, heart diseases, skin diseases, endemic illnesses of
all types, not to mention mental disturbances &#8211; are rapidly
spreading among the German population. Lieutenant General Clay has
admitted the existence of over 100,000 tuberculosis cases alone in
the American lone, of which 85,000 are not being treated in hospitals
but are, instead, free to spread infection. The physical undermining
of the German nation physically is unprecedented in European history.
That this should happen &#8220;according to plan&#8221; is inconceivable
except in the modern world. Fritz Sternberg, writing in the February
8, 1947, <strong>Nation</strong>) is correct in stating:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;No lengthy documentation is needed to prove that even
the increased food ration of 1,500 calories is absolutely
insufficient. With the workers so undernourished, an increase in
German production to the minimum figure set at Potsdam is impossible.
People must get more than 2,000 calories a day if industrial activity
in Germany is to be revived.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">And he quotes the apt summary of the general social condition of
Germany in the remarks of Dr. Kurt Schumacher, Social Democratic
leader in the British zone:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The situation in Germany is such that 35 per cent of the
inhabitants have not only retained all they possessed before the war
but have become in effect even richer because the others have become
poorer. Another group, about 25 per cent, have not enough to live on
but through connections of all sorts manage to keep body and soul
together. The rest of the people, 40 per cent of all Germans, have
nothing but their food ration cards. Such conditions mean latent
social revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">&#8220;Connections of all sorts&#8221; refers, of course, to the black
market. Only the German middle class that retained some savings can
engage in these &#8220;connections.&#8221; But all signs prove that these
people are now rapidly exhausting their savings, and selling the last
of their valuable accumulations. The haunting fear of a wild
inflation, followed by a devaluation of the <em>mark</em> that will
wipe out whatever remains of their savings, has been heightened by
wide rumors of impending financial changes in the Western zone. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>
Butter sells for 200 <em>marks</em> per pound on the black market ($2,
if we accept the 10 cent evaluation of the <em>mark</em>), or three
packs of American cigarettes. Current production, such of it as
remains in Germany, is too minute to alleviate any of the pressures
placed upon the German population, physically or morally. It is a
piddling production, compared to the needs, despite the economic
unification of the British and American zones. The German people
today stand at the lowest and most humiliating point of their
history, in terms of living standards, economic activity, morale, and
cultural life. It is inconceivable for them to sink lower, or to pass
through another such winter as that of 1946&#8211;47, without a national
catastrophe. But this poses squarely the entire problem of a
unifiedGermany, with a revived national economy &#8211; or, in political
terms, the Moscow negotiations between the Big Powers for a German
Treaty. Potsdam is dead; what shall take its place? This is the issue
which confronts the Big Four enslavers of the German nation.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Moscow Conference</h4>

<p class="fst">For six solid weeks, the Big Four Foreign Ministers sat in Moscow,
attempting to draw up peace treaties with Austria and Germany. Not
only were the efforts to conclude an Austrian treaty unsuccessful &#8211;
contrary to first expectations &#8211; but in addition, all efforts to
approach even tentative agreement on the fateful German question have
failed, unless the establishing of strategic diplomatic positions can
be called success. The divergence of views is wide, reflecting the
depth of the imperialist antagonisms over, not only what kind of
oppressive treaty to impose upon the Germans, but, more important, in
which direction Germany shall move in the future.</p>

<p>The question is not one, actually, of whether or not a German
treaty will be drawn up and ultimately signed. None of the
participants in this contest of sinister bargaining &#8211; sinister
because it directly involves the fate of 65,000,000 peoples &#8211; have
illusions on this score. The retired Secretary of State Byrnes spoke
recently of perhaps two years of negotiations; Britain&#8217;s Bevin is
as sceptical; others question whether a formal accord will ever be
reached. The terms of the treaty itself are formalities, embodying
politics and policies that each of the powers are already putting
into practice, or intend to put into practice. The real question is
whether these policies can be bound together, temporarily at least,
by some common denominator formulas, or whether the divergencies will
lead to a premature breaking apart of the Big Four, in turn
precipitating an inevitable war. Since it is our contention that at
the present stage none of the Big Four desires, or is prepared, for
war, there will be no such split. Whether this will lead to the
actual formulation of a general treaty for Germany is impossible to
say. But it will certainly lead, in practice, to a series of
agreements, if only on a day-to-day basis, if only to prevent the
complete disintegration, economically and socially, of the German nation.</p>

<p>The German policies of the imperialist powers then, proceed on
various layers of development, thus accounting for its complexity,
confusion and contradictions. Each power, within its zones, pursues
its own unique goals; but each power is forced to arrive at some
common basis of operations with its rivals, to prevent the situation
from getting out of hand, to hold the German people in check. The
Potsdam Agreement waS such an understanding. Time and developments
buried it. The Moscow Conferences of the future will arrive at some
new understanding, regardless of whether it is embodied in treaty
form, until fresh developments revive the problem in a different
form. But so long as imperialism keeps its hands on the throats of
the German people, the &#8220;German question&#8221; will be the uppermost
issue in European politics.</p>

<p>What are the basic differences between the Allies in the matter of
writing a German treaty? <strong>Pravda</strong> provides a convenient source
for listing the major suspicions and accusations held by Russian
imperialism against its &#8220;democratic&#8221; opponents. From various
articles published in this official source book of Russian
imperialist policy, the following may be deduced:</p>

<ol>
<li>Most basic accusation of all is that rival Anglo-American
imperialism, with the intention of basing itself upon the Ruhr
industrial potential, is building up a Western Germany and-Soviet
<em>bloc</em>. The positive aspect of this accusation is the demand of
Russia for a share in the control and production of the Ruhr &#8211; an
issue that proved to be one of the major points at issue in Moscow.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The British nationalization for their zone, and the
modified American version of these plans, are disguised plots &#8211; in
the eyes of Russian imperialism &#8211; for the restoration of Western
Germany&#8217;s war industries. These plans, it is charged,would still
leave the industries under the influence of &#8220;private owners and
monopolists&#8221; who would remain leaders of German economy.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>The economic unification of the British and American zones
is part of the scheme to form a Western Germany, under Allied
control, and then &#8211; hiding behind the excuse that collapse is
inevitable &#8211; to partly rebuild this area, cut off from the Eastern
(Russian) zone, and prepare the stage for a new European war.
Parallel with the process, it is charged, goes the conscious
disorganization of economy so that German industrialists are being
forced to &#8220;yield a considerable portion of their property to
United States and British capitalists.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>From these charges, there follow a series of secondary,
subsidiary accusations. These themes upon which the Russian press
constantly harps are: (a) Failure of the Western Allies to carry out
the disarmament program; (b) Failure to give Russia her share of
promised reparations from the Western zone; (c) Sabotage of the
Potsdam Accord, and economic unification of the two zones to offset
this sabotage; (d) Failure to carry through the denazification
program and, in fact, conscious protection of important Nazi
officialdom, with a deliberate building up of reactionary political
groups (Christian-Democrats, etc.); (e) and, finally, tendencies
toward erection of a decentralized, federalized and easily
controlled govern-mental structure for Greater Germany. The mere
listing of these points indicates the depth and quality of the
differences between the great imperialist rivals. It will not be
easy to arrive at even a temporary accord; one that can survive more
than a few years. The dispute over Germany is more than a matter of
disagreement on important, even fundamental, issues. It is, at
bottom, an irreconcilable disagreement between the Anglo-American
capitalist-imperialist system and the Russian
bureaucratic-collectivist imperialist system. It is a dispute that
will endure, in varying degrees, until the inevitable war comes; or
until the international working class is capable of solving it in a
different fashion.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">Out of the Moscow Conference has emerged the following general
picture of American policy with respect to Germany. It is a policy
that is distinguished by confusion, half-heartedness, unbalance and
that general incapacity to drive through a definite program that so
characterizes American imperialism in all fields.</p>

<p>America desires a long, indefinite occupation for the obvious
purpose of retaining strong positions throughout Europe. America
desires an exceptionally weak central government, to prevent its use
by the German Stalinist (that is, pro-Russian) movement, and to
prevent any state manipulation by a possibly revived German
bourgeoisie. This weakened system is known as a federated German
structure, giving full play to all the centrifugal, provincial and
regional forces (most notorious of which is Bavaria) that exist in
the country. America desires a limited, tightly controlled economic
productivity that will satisfy the imperialist utopia of (a)
providing a satisfactory market for the United States; (b) keep the
population sufficiently clothed and fed so as not to encourage
resistance; (c) yet limit productivity to a sufficiently low degree
that German export competition will not exist. The impossibility of
achieving such a balance accounts for the numerous contradictory
statements and actions (attacks on German cartels, followed by
attacks upon nationalization schemes, etc.) that make it almost
impossible to make any sense out of American policy for German industry.</p>

<p>The truth is that there is no set policy, particularly with
respect to a perspective for the industrial and economic future of
Germany. For the first period of occupation, the notorious
Morgenthau-Pastoralization plan prevailed in practice. Every effort
was made to reduce German productivity to new lows. The <em>political</em>
meaning of this plan, operating in the setting of growing
American-Russian conflict, forced its conscious abandonment. No clear
alternative replaced it. The series of three reports of the Hoover
Commission represent a definite alternative and would mean, if put
into practice, a sharp break with past and present policy, the
re-industrialization of the Anglo-American zone, and the pouring of
vast sums into this area to &#8220;prime the industrial pump.&#8221; This
alternative has not yet been accepted, even though the tendency is in
that direction.</p>

<p>But it is, at best, only a tendency. The American authorities, for
example, are attempting to sabotage and thwart the proposals of the
British for the full merger (without limitations) of their respective
zones, together with the outright nationalization of all heavy
industries within the two zones, and their operation under a
centralized state system. The British seem anxious to drive straight
ahead and create a clearly delineated Western Germany (into which the
French zone will be forced), with an economic life of its own that
will counterpose one <em>bloc</em> in Europe against the Russian <em>bloc</em>
of Europe that remains behind the Iron Curtain. But American
imperialism continues to waver, to drift from day to day, food crisis
to food crisis. The money it puts into Germany, for materials and
food, is too small an amount to provide the necessary &#8220;lift&#8221; to
the badly damaged and disrupted economy. This money, then, represents
wasted capital, poured down the drain. Energetic billions rather than
timid millions would change the story. But this appears most
improbable because of the fears of a revival of a powerful competitor
and rival at an inopportune moment; that is, when the entire
capitalist world can only fearfully speculate on how soon (not
whether) the next world economic crisis will occur. American policy
with respect to Germany will thus continue without hope, without
decisive action, without plan. It will be a day-to-day policy,
meeting each new crisis with temporary measures, and <em>guaranteed to
continue the present general stagnation and hopelessness, both
economically and morally</em>.</p>

<p>The prospects for the building up in Germany of a mass, popular
movement of resistance to the occupying forces of all countries, now
seem quite favorable. The activities of the revived German trade
union movement, particularly in the British zone, are important steps
in this direction; above all, the reassertion by the German working
class of its role as leader of the oppressed nation. More and more,
the masses of Germans are becoming aware of the impossibility of
their living under indefinite occupation by foreign powers, and of
the fact that the axis of their struggles to live revolves around the
issue of regaining their independence and freedom to exist as a
nation.</p>
