<p class="fst">The struggle of India&rsquo;s 375,000,000 people for their freedom
from British tyranny is centered today in the struggle between the
contending wings of the Indian Nationalist Congress.</p>

<p>The conservative right wing, headed by Mahatma Gandhi, indulged in
much radical talk and threats for a while, but has again staged a
treacherous retreat and is doing its utmost to prevent any action.
Utilizing the false grounds that the country is not prepared for a
campaign of civil disobedience, Gandhi is pushing for further
negotiation with the British authorities.</p>

<p>Subhas Chandra Bose, former president of the Congress, spokesman
for the left-wing Nationalists, has lately issued a statement
blasting Gandhi and his supporters from stem to stern. It is one of
the bitterest denunciations of the Gandhi leadership ever to be made.
In his statement Bose accused Gandhi of sabotaging the desire of the
Indian people to struggle and of dissipating the revolutionary
energies of the masses.</p>

<p>Of still greater significance was Bose&rsquo;s statement that the
Congress left wing would not go along with the Ghandhists unless they
immediately adopted a program for action. Bose stated that the left
wing would go forward on its own, regardless of Gandhi&rsquo;s
attempted sabotage. He likewise accused Gandhi &ndash; and correctly
so &ndash; of more violently opposing the Congress radicals than the
British imperialists.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>No Support to Britain!</h4>

<p class="fst">The Congress Socialist Party, India&rsquo;s leading radical party,
in a statement criticizing the Gandhi leadership for attempting to
bargain with the British on the issue of the war, has declared: <em>&ldquo;We
cannot conceive of any gesture or concession on the part of the
British Government that could possibly justify the Congress in
supporting the imperialist war.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>This viewpoint genuinely represents the sentiments of all Indian
radical workers. No support to the British under any circumstances!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the struggle of the masses continues. In the city of
Jubbulpore, 100 natives were killed and wounded by British police &ndash;
who were exercising their democratic right to murder unarmed people &ndash;
when they held a demonstration protesting against rising food prices
produced by the drainage of India&rsquo;s food supplies for British
war needs. <strong>Pravda</strong>, publication of the Soviet Russian
government, reports &ldquo;mass arrests&rdquo; of Congress radicals
are now going on.</p>

<p>Figures released by the British authorities dealing with strikes
for the first six months of this year reveal the growing activities
of India&rsquo;s working class. There were 109 strikes, involving
100,000 workers. A total of 1,580,000 working days were spent in
these strikes. Textile and jute workers accounted for 40% of the
strikes and 62% of the workers involved. The figures for the last six
months of 1939 will run far higher.</p>
