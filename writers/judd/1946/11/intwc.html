<h3>South Africa</h3>

<p class="fst">Joining together with other sections of the Fourth International,
the Trotskyist organization of South Africa has gone on record
favoring unification of the American movement. We quote in full a
resolution recently adopted by these comrades and forwarded to us.</p>

<p>We regret that the Workers International League of South Africa
has not yet achieved a full and rounded understanding of the 1939&#8211;40
fight in the Socialist Workers Party which led to the split and
formation of the Workers Party. Points one to four in their
resolution indicate that they still adhere to the version of the
Cannon majority which Trotsky unfortunately shared. The facts are not
wholly accurate and the interpretation is most unsound.</p>

<p>However, this difference over an interpretation of the past is of
secondary importance to the key question of unity today. It is
because of this that we find the position of our South African
comrades so welcome. Unlike the unprincipled position of the Cannon
faction of the SWP. the South Africans do not make agreement on the
causes of the 1940 split a precondition to unity today.</p>

<p>Their resolution follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Although the Workers International League is not yet
officially a section of the Fourth International, we are however
vitally interested in the discussions now proceeding in the Socialist
Workers Party on unification with the Workers Party and after
examination of all available documents and material, the Executive
Committee has taken the following stand:</p>

<p class="quoteb">1. That the Socialist Workers Party minority in 1940 was
completely unjustified in splitting from the SWP and its action dealt
a. cruel blow to the Fourth International in a time of world crisis.
In the principal ideological dispute of the Russian question we agree
with Comrade Trotsky&#8217;s characterization of Soviet Russia as a
degenerated workers state, yet worthy of unconditional defense
against imperialist aggression. We reject the WP theory of the
Russian state as being one of bureaucratic collectivism.</p>

<p class="quoteb">2. Although pointing out the petty-bourgeois nature of
the opposition in 1940 Trotsky sought to maintain the unity of the
SWP and affirmed that the ideas of the minority were compatible with
remaining inside the Fourth International.</p>

<p class="quoteb">3. Six years after the split the minority organized in
the WP has expressed its dew sire to reunite with the SWP and to take
its place in the ranks of the only world party of socialist
revolution the Fourth International. During these six years of its
independent existence, the WP has maintained a Leninist attitude to
its own ruling class-calling for the continuation of the class
struggle against American capitalism and its reactionary war.
Burnham, the chief representative of the petty-bourgeois tendency,
left the WP and other petty-bourgeois tendency, left the WP and other
bourgeois members rubbed off their petty-bourgeois dusting by coming
into close contact with the working class in the factories and army.
This can give new impetus to the fusion of the two organizations and
aid the building up of the mass Bolshevik revolutionary party for America.</p>

<p class="quoteb">4. The chief obstacle towards unity was the refusal of
the WP membership to subordinate themselves to the majority decision
inside the SWP and to abide by the principles of democratic
centralism. The move towards unity indicates a change of attitude and
readiness to accept the principle of democratic centralism and to
work as disciplined members in the carrying out of the program and
the policies of the SWP.</p>

<p class="quoteb">5. The unity of the two organizations is a progressive
step in the development of the Fourth International in America, a
pooling of revolutionary resources which we fully support. It would
also influence the International towards cohesion and give new
strength to the struggling Trotskyist groups elsewhere and serve to
discourage splits and fruitless division in the other Trotskyist groups.</p>

<p class="quoteb">6. We firmly believe that the ideas of the WP are
compatible with membership in one organization with the SWP. The SWP
has grown significantly during the war years and has brought the
ideas of Trotskyism to increasing sections of the workers. Unity with
the WP would remove a rival organization and clear up the confusion
that the present co-existence of two Trotskyist parties with similar
programs must necessarily have created in the minds of the advanced
workers of America.</p>

<p class="quoteb">7. In order to facilitate the fusion of the two parties
we support the holding of joint membership meetings, the issuing of
joint bulletins and the engaging in common action in trade unions.
elections, etc., so that a firm and lasting unity can be achieved.</p>

<p class="quoteb">8. We strongly urge the SWP majority to bring about unity
with the WP and in this way prevent any further split in the
Trotskyist ranks. We also urge its minority not to split but to
continue to work for the consolidation of all the revolutionary
forces in America.</p>

<h3>India-Ceylon</h3>

<p class="fst">A <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/vol12/no06/ceylon.html" target="new">note</a> published in the August 1946 <strong>New International</strong> regarding the position of the Ceylon section of the Fourth
International on the problem of China&#8217;s role in the Second World
War requires correction and amplification. It was not only the Ceylon
section that adopted the same position as that held by the Workers
Party in America &#8211; namely, the impermissibility of supporting
China&#8217;s war within the general confines of the world imperialist
struggle. <em>The Bolshevik Leninist Party of India</em>, to which the
Ceylon section is federated as its Ceylon unit, adopted the
resolution, along the <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/shachtma/1942/06/china.htm" target="new">political lines</a> presented by Comrade Max Shachtman in <strong>The New International <em>Supplement</em></strong>, June 1942.</p>

<p>Contact with the Indian section of the Fourth International, and
its unit in Ceylon, has now been re-established. We shall devote the
major part of our December issue to the problems of India today,
including the Hindu-Moslem question, the Pakistan slogan and a
theoretical document explaining the approach of the Ceylon unit to
the problem of the national revolution in their country.</p>

<p>The Indian party now publishes a legal paper, <strong>Spark</strong>, as
well as a theoretical magazine of high quality, <strong>The Permanent
Revolution</strong>. The Ceylon unit issues four publications, a
fortnightly newspaper in English titled <strong>Fight</strong>, and newspapers
in Singhalese, Tamil and another language of Ceylon and South India.
All these publications have legal status and a correspondingly wide
circulation. The Ceylon unit is a legally functioning organization,
while the Indian section &#8211; suppressed during the war &#8211; is slowly
achieving legal status in the nation.</p>

<p>Both organizations participate actively in the class struggles of
their respective countries. We hope to publish details on their work.
A split of serious proportions has taken place, immediately after the
end of the war, within the ranks of the former Lanka Sama Samaj Party
of Ceylon, resulting in the formation of the above-mentioned Ceylon
unit of the Fourth International, with a partly new and partly old
leadership. The causes and nature of the split are not yet too clear.
The former Lanka Sama Samaj Party (still functioning in Ceylon, under
the same name) undoubtedly is the stronger and more popular of the
two organizations, retaining its mass popularity among the workers
and peasants of the island. Its exact political stand on the split is
not known to us as yet. It must, however, be noted that the Lanka
Sama Samaj, although claiming to be a Trotskyist and Fourth
Internationalist party, has gone far along the road leading to
capitulation to Stalinism. It has hailed, in its press, the demagogic
activities of Russia and the Stalinist movement in behalf of the
colonies and has accepted the fatal illusion that Stalinism is
swinging toward a &#8220;revolutionary stand.&#8221; We quote from an issue
of their paper (<strong>Samasamajist</strong>, July 24, 1946) to illustrate the
extent of this trend:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The struggle between the forces of democracy and
semi-feudal reaction in Persia is sweeping the entire country....
Britain is on the side of reaction and conservatism, whilst the
Soviet Union is encouraging the democratic and working-class forces
to organize themselves to overthrow feudal reaction and end British
imperialist domination of the land of Iran ... a phase of the
development of democratic and working class forces which are
struggling to liberate themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">In general, the Lanka Sama Samaj Party leadership is permeated
with the fiction that Russia is working in behalf of the colonial
movements for national liberation.</p>

<h3>France</h3>

<p class="fst">From September 7 to September 12, the PCI (Workers&#8217; Communist
Party) of France, French section of the Fourth International, held a
special convention for discussion of basic political questions. On
the agenda were questions of the present situation in France,
including the issue of &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; voting in the past
referendum on the defeated French constitution, as well as the
question of support to the slogan of a &#8220;Socialist-Communist-CGT&#8221;
government. The question of the Russian state and a revolutionary
attitude toward Stalinism likewise occupied the representatives of
this major Fourth Internationalist section in Europe. In our next
issue we hope to present in detail the results of the convention, as
well as extracts from the various resolutions presented. Several
different tendencies, including one standing close to the political
line of the Workers Party, were represented at the convention. The
RCP (Revolutionary Communist Party) of England likewise held a
convention, the details of which we hope to report also.</p>

<h3>Stalinism at Work</h3>

<p class="fst">We give two examples of Stalinism at work.</p>

<ol>
<li>It has been revealed in the Indian nationalist and
Trotskyist press, by a former leading member of the Indian Communist
Party, that the leader of that organization &#8211; a cynical scoundrel
by the name of P.C. Joshi &#8211; acted directly as a police agent and
police spy for the British government during the war. Joshi kept a
special file, giving details on nationalists and radicals, for the
benefit of the British CID (the FBI of India). The British made
ample use of it for their arrests.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Action</strong>, a French Stalinist literary and political
publication, has posed the question, in serious vein, whether
Kafka&#8217;s works should be burned because of their &#8220;social
pessimism.&#8221; The violent attack upon the famous expressionist
author, Franz Kafka, leaves little doubt as to the answer of these
neo-totalitarian book-burners to their own question. We hope to
report in more detail on this event, and its repercussions among
French writers and intellectuals. An anti-Stalinist tendency is
growing rapidly among French writers and supporters of the
&#8220;<em>existentialiste</em>&#8221; school, so important during the
movement of the French Resistance.</li>
