<p class="fst">Here it is! The new, expanded, and hard-hitting eight-page <strong>Labor Action</strong> that you&rsquo;ve been waiting for. Take a good look at it &ndash; we think it&rsquo;s a good socialist paper and hope you agree with us. We aim to make it better as we go along.</p>

<p>This column is to help stimulate circulation and subscriptions to the new eight-page <strong>Labor Action</strong>. From next week on, it will be turned over exclusively to the many and devoted <strong>Labor Action</strong> agents we have all over the country. It will be a column recording their circulation feats, the number of subs they&rsquo;ve sold from week to week, and their ideas for increasing the press run of the paper.<br />

<h4><em>Labor Action</em> Agents Speak Up</h4>

<p class="fst">From Detroit our charming peaches- and-cream agent, Miriam Evans, sends us a detailed report on the Detroit branch&rsquo;s plans for the new eight-page <strong>Labor Action</strong>. Writes Miriam:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The Literature Committee has begun to make plans for selling the new <strong>Labor Action</strong>. So far, this is what we&rsquo;ve decided to do: (1) Regular sales at newsstands; (2) Regular sales at local union meetings. We are going to have regular salesmen for each local meeting; (3) Special and city-wide meetings. We are going to sell at veterans&rsquo; meetings, NAACP meetings, Zionist rallies, PAC and rallies on the OPA question, etc.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">From Chicago, irrepressible Dan Leeds, the new Chicago literature agent, sends this idea for consideration:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;For contact work we are going to assemble a literature kit made up of <strong>Labor Action</strong>, <strong>The New International</strong>, <strong>Plenty for All</strong> pamphlet and five five-cent pamphlets which will all be for sale at 25 cents.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">From San Pedro, Agent Brent writes about future circulation plans of the branch:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;We plan to try to get the paper on newsstands. We&rsquo;ll let you know how we make out on this score. Our branch distribution concentration is longshore. We plan to send in an article on the maritime situation every other week to <strong>Labor Action</strong>. The issues of <strong>Labor Action</strong> containing these articles will be sold and distributed at the Longshore hiring hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>Labor Action</strong> agents: This column is for you. Write in to it and we will see to it that your ideas, complaints and proposals are circulated.</p>
