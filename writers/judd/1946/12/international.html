<p class="fst">In our November issue of <strong>The New International</strong>
we promised our readers reports on two significant conventions held by
sections of the Fourth International &#8212; the Internationalist Communist
Party of France (PCI), and the Revolutionary Communist Party of Great
Britain (RCP). Below we give the most important details of these
conventions, both of which mark definite progress away from the
repetition of sterile, orthodox dogma and progress toward ideologic and
revolutionary clarity:<br>
&nbsp;</p>


<h3>French Trotskyist Convention</h3>
<p class="fst">The Third Convention of the Parti Communiste
Internationaliste, French Section of the 4th International, was held
from September 7th to 11th. Considerable progress was manifested since
the previous convention in February. A large majority of the 102
delegates, however, felt that the progress would have been much greater
if the leadership elected in February had been more capable &#8212;
organizationally and politically.</p>


<p>The progress of the PCI since February, 1946, was considerable in
several fields. The party increased its membership by between &#8220;50 and
75 per cent.&#8221; The increase was by no means localized at the center. On
the contrary, the increase was notable at the opposite ends of France.
Where groups existed, they grew, e.g., the Bordeaux region doubled.
Entirely new regions came into being where before there were one or two
comrades or none at all. From Alsace-Lorraine to Corsica, from the
Italian to the Belgian frontier regions there are now groups of the PCI.</p>


<p>Another big gain was the legalization of <strong>La Verit&eacute;</strong>
in which the pressure of left wing groups all over the world, including
sections of the SP in France and the SWP and WP in the US, played a
part. This was followed by the enlargement of the paper from a tabloid
size two-pager into a full size four-pager attuned more closely to the
life and struggles of the masses.</p>



<p>Of great importance was the role of the PCI in the development of
the revolutionary left wing in the unions and in the recent strike
actions. The left wing workers grouped around the paper <strong>Front
Ouvrier</strong> played an important part in the recent teachers&#8217; and
CGT (labor federation) conventions as well as in the printers and
postal-telegraph-telephone strikes. Not only did <strong>Front Ouvrier</strong>,
in which our comrades collaborate, increase its strength, but the PCI
itself made a good name for itself. Particularly in the PTT strike,
where a special issue of <strong>La Verit&eacute;</strong> was put out
and well received. There was a valuable discussion of this strike by
the delegates.</p>


<p>The second and third days of the convention were given over to the
political report and its discussion, in which 80 delegates took part.
The following two major tendencies manifested themselves:</p>


<p class="fst">1) <em>The Frank tendency</em> &#8212; heart of the old
majority &#8212; centered around the old Molinier group which fused with the
party during the war. This group, supported by the International
Secretariat, had one-third of the delegates. Its political line
reflects the influence of the SWP (Cannon faction). Its position is
based on its belief that we are in a revolutionary crisis (second
wave), and therefore calls for what amounts to organs of dual power,
and the creation of an extra-parliamentary CP-SP-CGT government. &#8220;The
revolutionary crisis engendered by World War II is of a depth and
extension far superior to that of the years 1917-1923,&#8221; i.e., to that
which produced the Russian October, a Soviet Hungary and Saxony and
various Soviet revolts in Germany, Finland, Bulgaria, etc., if one
believes the Frank resolution. Not believing that the offensive of the
bourgeoisie against the Socialist-Communist bloc for the May
Constitution, with its virtual abolition of the reactionary Senate,
posed any serious danger of a defeat for the working class, the Frank
group clings to its opposition to the &#8220;Yes&#8221; stand taken by the PCI.
However, part of the group (Frank) was for a &#8220;No&#8221; answer and most of it
for a blank ballot.</p>



<p class="fst">2) <em>The Geoffroy-Demazi&egrave;re-Craipeau group</em>,
the former minority, had a slight majority at this convention, 52
delegates. For them the situation is characterized by a reconsolidation
of bourgeois rule and a getting into motion of capitalist economy,
accompanied by a series of defeats of the working class and a lowered
level of class consciousness due to the war, the occupation and those
defeats (speedy liquidation of militia, factory committees and all
other workers organs since August 1944, transfer of the struggle to
purely parliamentary forms due to the CP and SP leaders, parliamentary
defeats and retreats &#8212; Constitution) and a corresponding rebirth of
parliamentary and democratic illusions. The economic lift opens up new
perspectives of labor struggle although necessarily at a lower level to
start with, due to those defeats and illusions. The party can play a
decisive role by applying its economic and democratic slogans so as to
help set the masses in action and to generalize and raise the level of
such action.</p>


<p>This group has shifted the CP-SP-CGT slogan to &#8220;Break the
Coalition.&#8221; It offers two reasons. Firstly, because, as a
concretization of the idea of &#8220;oust the bourgeois (MRP) ministers&#8221; it
no longer has sense since the SP and CP no longer have a majority in
parliament. Secondly, because considering it as a concretization in
immediate agitation of the slogan &#8220;Workers and peasants government&#8221;
means posing the problem of extraparliamentary power organs, obviously
not sensible today. They therefore replace it in agitation with &#8220;Break
the coalition with the bourgeois ministers&#8221; and relegate &#8220;Workers and
peasants government&#8221; to general propaganda.</p>


<p>In addition to these two major (Majority and Minority) tendencies,
there are other small ideological groupings within the party which
oppose the &#8220;CP-SP-CGT government&#8221; slogan and have varying estimates of
the general situation in France today, as well as different positions
on the basic question of Russia, as indicated below.<br>
&nbsp;</p>


<h4>Differ on Russian Question</h4>
<p class="fst">The Russian resolution of the old Frank majority takes
the traditional line of defense, while declaring that the occupied
countries remain capitalist but at the same time says that in the
unlikely case &#8220;of the Soviet occupation continuing for years and
bringing about a structural assimilation (which they say elsewhere is
the tendency), it would result in a development of the productive
forces far surpassing all that those countries have known during 30
years of capitalist evolution.&#8221; They further say that they oppose the
Stalinist methods of struggle against the local capitalists &#8220;not
because they are inhuman, but because they are ineffective.&#8221; They also
attack &#8220;Shachtman and now L., etc.,&#8221; who, in &#8220;isolating&#8221; Trotsky&#8217;s
prophesy (that the war, won or lost, would finish Stalin), show that
they &#8220;didn&#8217;t understand its meaning.&#8221; The only error was of &#8220;rhythm and
limit and not of analysis,&#8221; they say, and to say otherwise one must
&#8220;prove that the direction of Russia&#8217;s evolution has changed.&#8221;</p>


<p>The M. group bases its defensism primarily on its fear of a
capitalist victory opening up new areas to exploitation, but continues
to call Russia a workers&#8217; state.</p>


<p>The newly formed M.C. group is defeatist and considers Russia a
bureaucratic collectivist state, but opposes the use of the term
&#8220;imperialist&#8221; because they say it leads to confusion with capitalist
imperialism.</p>



<p>The Guerin group is defeatist and its resolution holds that Russia
is imperialist but not capitalist &#8220;in the same sense as the others.&#8221;
The resolution takes no stand on the problem of State capitalism or
Bureaucratic collectivism.</p>


<p><em>The multitude of positions convinced everyone that further
discussion is necessary in the party and it was decided to open that
discussion after the convention with a special conference on the
Russian question to be held in six months.</em></p>


<hr class="section" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<h3>[Revolutionary Communist Party]</h3>
<p class="fst">The convention of the Revolutionary Communist Party of
Great Britain did not, unfortunately, reveal the same organizational
growth and progress as did that of the French section of the Fourth
International. Recognizing the extreme power and attractiveness of the
Labor Party to the masses of English workers, the convention resolution
dealing with the political situation in England admitted an
overestimation in its previous prognosis of a sharp swing to the left,
based upon a disillusionment with the Labor Government, which would
benefit the RCP. This did not materialize, but unfortunately the
Convention drew only a fatalistic conclusion from it, rejecting
overwhelmingly the proposal of the International Executive Committee
that the RCP join <em>en masse</em> the British Labor Party. The RCP,
in sharp contrast with the French PCI, seems stagnating and incapable
of grappling with the realities of English national political life.</p>


<p>After a long period of ignoring or barely considering the so-called
Russian Question, the RCP finds itself involved in an intense
discussion on this issue. Three different tendencies were revealed at
the Convention during a discussion that will undoubtedly continue in
the post-convention life of the party. The Majority (Haston-Grant)
tendency &#8212; the party leadership &#8212; has developed the novel
interpretation of Trotsky&#8217;s analysis of the Soviet Union to the effect
that, although Russia today has a &#8220;capitalistic economy&#8221; (exhibiting
all the features of capitalism, including operation of the law of
value, commodity production for the market, wage-labor, etc., etc.), it
nevertheless remains a &#8220;Workers&#8217; State.&#8221; The party Minority clings to
the traditional (that is, sterile) characterization of Russia and
brands the Majority as revisionist, preparing the way for acceptance of
the &#8220;State Capitalist&#8221; theory regarding Russia or of the &#8220;bureaucratic
collectivist&#8221; theory. A small minority, headed by comrades from the
Irish section, advanced substantially the &#8220;bureaucratic collectivist&#8221;
point of view held by the Workers Party in America. These three
tendencies will now be discussed within the ranks of the party.</p>


<p>It is important to note that these two conventions of the leading
European sections of the Fourth International mark definite progress
toward reconsideration of the entire Russian question &#8212; a most welcome
event, long considered necessary by us. The Russian defensist position,
still clung to with desperation by the SWP in America, is becoming
increasingly untenable throughout the International. A thoroughgoing
re-evaluation of this issue is on the order of the day. Bureaucratic
smugness can answer everything but the pressure of history.</p>
