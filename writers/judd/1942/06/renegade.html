<p class="fst"><strong>Dear Editor:</strong></p>

<p class="fst">The other night, while listening to the radio, I heard an official government propaganda program which has become very popular. It is known as <em>Report to the Nation</em>. This particular patriotic session dealt with the use of air power, and the part I listened to gave a story about America supporting China in the war; how America would never let the Chinese people down, etc.</p>

<p>At the end of the program the announcer informed us that the script was written by one Harold R. Isaacs, a name that had a familiar ring to it.</p>

<p>Could this be the same Harold R. Isaacs who wrote a book on China called <strong>The Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution</strong> and who, according to the introduction by Trotsky, &#8220;approaches the revolution as a revolutionist? ...&#8221; The author of this book, which describes China&#8217;s effort to free itself of western imperialism, claims to be an &#8220;orthodox&#8221; Trotskyist and has many a scathing remark to make about American imperialism&#8217;s dirty work in China. He keeps mentioning such facts as &#8220;British and American gunboats promptly opened up a bombardment of the city (Nanking) ... (page 164); &#8220;The leading role played by the Americans in the bombardment of Nanking on March 24 ...&#8221; (page 194); &#8220;American, British, Italian, French and Japanese gunboats open fire repeatedly ...&#8221; (page 425); &#8220;American, British, Italian and German planes made Chinese skies horrible for the defenseless peasants ...&#8221; (page 425), etc., etc.</p>

<p>Of course, all this took place some time ago &#8211; maybe Anglo-American imperiaiism has changed now!</p>

<p>If this is the same Isaacs, we wonder what the &#8220;living fighters of the Chinese Revolution,&#8221; to whom his book is dedicated, would think of the author&#8217;s base desertion to the imperialist cause.</p>
