<p class="fst">At the end of last week&rsquo;s session of the 5,000,000-strong
Indian Nationalist Congress one clear fact had emerged from the
deliberately confused reports appearing in the American press.</p>

<p>If not formally, then in reality, the Indian Nationalist movement
is <em>split</em>. It is split sharply between its conservative,
Gandhi-led right wing and its left-wing headed by ex-President of the
Congress, Subhas Bose.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of Indian workers, peasants and Congress
organizers had travelled to Ramgarh from all parts of the Indian
sub-continent to attend these historic sessions. They found that the
sessions constituted one of the briefest Congress meetings ever held,
lasting apparently less than three days. All of the work of the
Congress was done prior to the full sessions by the Gandhi dominated
Subjects Committee and Executive Committee.</p>

<p>The resolution of the Subjects Committee, adopted by the Congress
delegates in great haste, called attention to Gandhi&rsquo;s
unwillingness to begin an anti-war or independence campaign at this
time. It therefore follows that the Congress can do nothing &ndash;
until Gandhi chooses to be &ldquo;willing.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Action Voted Down</h4>

<p class="fst">All amendments &ndash; demanding a complete break With England,
urging a revolutionary, mass action program and the launching of the
independence campaign <em>now</em> &ndash; were voted down by the
Gandhi followers. It was politely hinted that no action by Gandhi and
the Congress could be expected for at &ldquo;least three months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The meaning of this is that no action can ever be expected from
Gandhi because if another three months drones by without anything
occurring, the Congress will fall into an even more demoralized state
than today and will lose all its support among the masses.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Emergence of Bose</h4>

<p class="fst">Obviously, the most significant fact about the Ramgarh sessions
was the dramatic emergence of the left wing nationalist, Subhas Bose.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Rump Session Acts</h4>

<p class="fst">Speaking at the rump Congress session he organized in an adjoining
field, Bose declared the aim of his Anti-Compromise Congress. &ldquo;Before
parting we must establish permanent machinery for waging an
uncompromising war. <em>The hope of this conference is that it will
prelude a nationwide struggle along an all-India front.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>As a first step in his program of action Bose organized a dramatic
demonstration of 5,000 men and women which marched through the Gandhi
Congress shouting, &ldquo;Down with Compromise.&rdquo; The impotent
supporters of Gandhi could only retort with &ldquo;Long live Gandhi.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>The split in the Congress ranks at Ramgarh and the emergence of
an anti-compromise wing is a decisive event, to be welcomed and
supported as a major step forward in the struggle against British
imperialism.</em></p>
