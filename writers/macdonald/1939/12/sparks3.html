<h4>Understatement Dept.</h4>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Experiments in how best to entertain soldiers back
of the Maginot Line have shown that movie shows come first, cards
second and games like dominoes third in popularity ... Few men show
any disposition to read books, possibly because there is always too
much interruption.&rdquo; &ndash; news report in a recent <strong>N.Y.
Times</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a id="p2" name="p2"></a>
<h4>Death, Inc.</h4>

<p class="fst">In previous columns, I have noted how the former sharp distinction
between war and peace has become blurred in our age, until by now war
has been absorbed into the normal, everyday routine of life under
capitalism.</p>

<p>This seems to hold true of both the bourgeoisie and the workers in
this war. As to the former, the British Government announced a few
weeks after the outbreak of the war that it would pay compensation
for all damages to civilian life, limb and property &ldquo;due to
action by or against the King&rsquo;s enemies&rdquo;. In announcing
this policy, Sir John Simon, Chancellor of the Exchequer, explained:
&ldquo;The risk is one which affects us all and a particular person
or a particular property which is struck is a casual victim of the
general peril which the State is engaged in doing its best to
resist.&rdquo; Thus war is officially recognized as one of the normal
hazards of doing business under capitalism, and the shopkeeper whose
windows are shattered by German bombs can collect from the State for
them just as if the damage had been done by His Majesty&rsquo;s
police officers in the discharge of their duty.</p>

<p>The British business man can also insure himself &ndash; with
private firms &ndash; against the hazards of peace. &ldquo;Armistice
insurance&rdquo; is now one of the regular forms of insurance in
London. For a premium of ten pounds on every hundred pounds worth of
business, a business man can fully insure himself against all losses
which might result if the war ends in the next two months. For every
additional month after that, he must pay ten pounds more.</p>

<p>For the workers as well, this war has taken on something of the
character of normal peacetime activity. In the last war, workers
began functioning as soldiers only when they put on their uniforms.
This time in uniform they still retain the character of workers
engaged in some vast industrial undertaking. Thus one recent news
item from the Maginot Line read: &ldquo;So great are the distances
that the troops actually ride to work on bicycles. We passed details
of them pedalling up from their living quarters to gun positions ...&rdquo;
The phrase, &ldquo;ride to work,&rdquo; is significant.</p>

<p>Another report describes the new field uniform of the British
Army:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The Highlanders whom General Gort visited were in their
picturesque uniforms ... The day was one of the last occasions on
which these and other Scottish troops will appear in the field in
their traditional uniforms. The change is being rapidly made from the
peacetime uniform to &lsquo;battle dress&rsquo; &ndash; a most
unromantic but eminently practical costume for combat, consisting of
a one-piece khaki overall with a zipper fastener down the front and
snaps at the trouser bottoms to keep out the mud.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Kilts and tartans give way to zippered khaki overalls. The soldier
has become a mass production worker who wears overalls and rides to
work on his bicycle. If the war drags on this way much longer, whole
industrial towns may spring up behind the lines, inhabited by
families of soldiers. The infantry &ldquo;worker&rdquo; will kiss his
wife goodbye in the morning and tramp, or cycle, off to &ldquo;work&rdquo;,
a rifle on one shoulder and a well-filled lunch box and thermos of
hot coffee under the arm. The thoroughly tamed trade union
bureaucracies in France and England will then raise some inspiring
new slogans: TIME AND A HALF FOR OVERTIME IN THE TRENCHES! NO
OFFENSIVES ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS AND SUNDAYS!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4><em>Anthology of War Poetry</em>, No.&nbsp;1</h4>

<p class="fst">Bernarr MacFadden, publisher of pulp magaazines, last year offered
a $1,000 prize for an official song for the U.S. Army Air Corps &ndash;
hitherto songless. I reproduce below the first verse of the winning
ditty, officially approved by Major General Henry H. Arnold, chief of
the Army Air Corps:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center" width="400">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">Off we go into the wild blue yonder,<br />
Climbing high into the sun;<br />
Here they come zooming to meet our thunder,<br />
At &rsquo;em boys, Give &rsquo;er the gun!<br />
Down we dive spouting our flame from under<br />
Off with one helluva* roar!<br />
We live, in fame<br />
Or go down in flame<br />
BOY! Nothing&rsquo;ll stop the Army Air Corps!</p>
</td>
