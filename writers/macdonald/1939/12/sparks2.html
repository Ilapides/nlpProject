<h4>Not Fit to Print</h4>

<p class="fst">Those who read the midnight edition of the <strong>N.Y. Times</strong> for
Friday, December 8, found on page 5 a story headlined, &ldquo;ANTI-WAR
SENTIMENT IN U.S. RISES, GALLUP SURVEY FINDS.&rdquo; Readers of later
editions found this news story still listed in the index, but, on
turning to page 5, they discovered the story had been removed. Nor
was it to be found elsewhere in the issue. 
</p>

<p>The <strong>Times</strong> is famous for its boast, &ldquo;All the News
That&rsquo;s Fit to Print.&rdquo; The anti-war story apparently was
judged by the editors less fit to print than the following items, all
of which appeared in the later editions on page 5: (1) Princess
Hohenloe leaves England <em>after losing her suit</em> against Lord
Rothermere; (2) the first death of a woman in the Royal Air Force is
recorded; (3) a lengthy story headlined, &ldquo;LONDON DOCKS HUM
DESPITE NAZI MINES.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a id="p2" name="p2"></a>
<h4>&ldquo;To Make the World Safe for Kaiserism&rdquo;</h4>

<p class="fst">The last war was fought to get rid of the Kaiser. This war &ndash;
according to certain conservative statesmen now in the British
cabinet who are talking of setting up again the imperial throne of
the Hohenzollerns &ndash; is being fought to bring back the Kaiser.
<em>&ldquo;Plus ca change, plus c&rsquo;est le meme chose,&rdquo;</em>
say the French, which means, &ldquo;The more things change, the more
they remain the same.&rdquo; Or, American style, &ldquo;No matter how
you slice it, it&rsquo;s always baloney.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a id="p3" name="p3"></a>
<h4>Perfidious Albion</h4>

<p class="fst">The same British ruling class circles which now are fighting the
war to restore the Hohenzollerns, not so long ago were the loyal
allies of the Nazi regime. The Bank of England, for example, was for
years notoriously friendly to the Nazis, taking the lead in extending
to Hitler the vast credits he needed to complete his rearmament
program. Then Hitler marched into Czech Slovakia, and the British
ruling class suddenly &ldquo;awoke&rdquo; to the fact that his plans
for expansion would inevitably come into conflict with the British
Empire, and that the real threat to their class interests came from
Nazi Germany and not from Stalinist Russia. There followed the
momentous change of political orientation which culminated in the
outbreak of the war.</p>

<p>The rupture between the Nazis and the bankers of London, however,
is not as complete as you might think from listening to Winston
Churchill&rsquo;s speeches. According to a recent issue of
<strong>Uncensored</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Today, three months after the outbreak of war, the
Bank of England is accepting German paper as collateral for loans to
British banks. Since Britain still regards German credits as sound,
it is quite possible that she may sell German paper to neutrals &ndash;
for example, to Swiss bankers who have already made credit agreements
with the Germans &ndash; and thus help promote a lively trade with
Germany.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">It is an especially confusing twist, in this most perplexing of
all wars, that the great New York banks refuse to accept German notes
and securities as collateral for loans, and in fact have been trying
desperately to liquidate the $50,000,000 worth of German paper they
held at the outbreak of war. Thus the bankers of belligerent England
show more confidence in and friendship towards the Hitler regime than
do the bankers of &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; America.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a id="p4" name="p4"></a>
<h4>Stalin&rsquo;s Automata</h4>

<p class="fst">Something I have thought a good deal about, especially in the last
few months, is the effect on individuals like Browder and Molotov and
other Stalinist mouthpieces of having to give expression continually
to lies &ndash; and lies, furthermore, which any child can see are in
contradiction to other lies they have uttered a few weeks earlier. It
is notable that Stalin is no orator, that he rarely breaks his
silence, at least not for publication. Shrewdly, he leaves to his
puppets the spirit-destroying task of formally justifying in public
the cynically opportunist twists of &ldquo;the general line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The recent public utterances of Molotov and Browder would make one
ashamed of the human species &ndash; were it not clear that such
politicians by now can hardly be considered men. A century ago a
French nobleman named De Custine travelled widely in Czarist Russia
and wrote a perceptive book about it. His description of &ldquo;the
human parts of the grand machine of state&rdquo; applies also to
their successors of present-day Russia.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Such parts,&rdquo; writes De Custine, &ldquo;acting
under an influence which is not in themselves, like the wheel-work of
a clock, are called men in Russia! The sight of these voluntary
automata inspires me with a kind of fear: there is something
supernatural in an individual reduced to the state of a mere machine.
If, in lands where the mechanical arts flourish, wood and metal seem
&lsquo;almost human&rsquo;, under despotisms, human beings seem to
become as instruments of wood. We ask ourselves what can have become
of their superfluity of thought? And we feel ill at ease to think of
the pressure that must have been exerted on intellectual creatures
before they could have been reduced to mere <em>things</em>.&rdquo;</p>
