<h4>Book Bargain</h4>

<p class="fst">Without much question the book bargain of the year, of many years,
is a quarto, of 396 pages entitled: <strong>The Structure of the American
Economy, Part I, Basic Characteristics</strong>. It is put out by the
National Resources Committee, a government research agency, and was
prepared by a large staff of economists under the direction of
Gardner C. Means (who was co-author, with Adolf Berle, of <strong>The
Modern Corporation and Private Property</strong>). It is printed on coated
stock, with many charts, graphs and maps, covering everything from
interlocking directorates of the two hundred biggest corporations to
the amount of money spent by various income groups on food, clothing,
tobacco, books, etc. And it can be obtained by sending one dollar to
the Superintendent of Documents, Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Marxists should find this book as absorbing reading as any
detective story. They will not expect Mr. Means and his staff to
reach any valid conclusions, and in this they will not be
disappointed. Mr. Means reaches no conclusions at all, in fact, which
is in this case perhaps a virtue. But he does present frankly and
honestly &ndash; within the limitations of the ruling class outlook &ndash;
the basic data on which any sort of effective political thinking,
Marxist or not, must be based.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a id="p2" name="p2"></a>
<h4>Lost: Two Hundred Billion Dollars</h4>

<p class="fst">In the next <strong>New International</strong> I plan to analyze and
summarize some of the wealth of data in this book. But there is one
point made here which is so dramatic an exposure of the insanity of
our capitalist system that it seems worth emphasizing here.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that during the last ten years there have been from
8,000,000 to 16,000,000,000 American workers for whom the system
could not provide jobs. Everyone, and especially the unemployed
themselves, know to what wretched, subhuman depths of poverty these
millions have been reduced. But it will come as a shock to most
people to learn that if the available manpower and machines in the
country had been employed fully in the eight years, 1930&ndash;1937,
our society would have produced two hundred billion dollars more
goods and services than it actually did.</p>

<p>Two hundred billion dollars is so huge a sum that it might as well
be two dollars. When figures reach a certain magnitude, they cease to
make any impression on the mind at all. They become abstract
concepts, like the number of trillion light years it would take to
reach some distant constellation. This volume however, makes it clear
what this figure means:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;The significance of this figure of two hundred
billions is hard to grasp, but some idea can be obtained by
considering what two hundred billion dollars would mean in terms of
concrete goods. If all the idle men and machines could have been
employed in making houses, the extra income would have been enough to
provide a new $6,000 house for every family in the country. If,
instead, the lost income had been used to build railroads, the entire
system of the country could have been scrapped and rebuilt at least
five times over ... Failure to use available resources meant a lower
standard of living for practically every group in the community.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">Later on, Means puts it in another why: &ldquo;If the whole waste
of the depression due to idle men and idle machines could have been
used to build agricultural and industrial plant, the existing plant
could have been completely rebuilt.&rdquo; That is, if we had had an
economic system not in contradiction to our productive forces, if
socialism had replaced capitalism in 1929, then every steel plant in
the country, every cotton mill and packing house and shoe factory and
every other industrial plant from Ford&rsquo;s River Rouge plant to
the smallest one-room machine, shop, every mile of railroad track,
every locomotive, every barn and silo and grain elevator &ndash; all
of this and a thousand other such categories of productive plants
could have been duplicated if the unemployed had been fully employed
in those eight years. Today we would be able to produce just twice as
many goods and services as we actually are able to produce.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a id="p3" name="p3"></a>
<h4>Still More</h4>

<p class="fst">Nor is this all. Even when our cockeyed capitalist system is
functioning at its very top form, even in the boom year of 1929, it
was unable to make anything like full use of our productive
resources.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The Brookings Institution,&rdquo; writes Means,
&ldquo;has estimated that in the peak year 1929 both production and
national income could have been increased 19 percent by merely
putting to work the men and machines that were idle in that year,
even without the introduction of improved techniques of production.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">Nor is this all. Means&rsquo;s figure of two hundred billion
dollars only goes through 1937. But in the fall of 1937 there
occurred the sharpest economic decline in the history of American
capitalism. In half a year, unemployment rose by 3,000,000 to a total
of 13,000,000; in a year, the farm price index dropped from 128 to
92, the index of industrial production fell from 118 to 76. Only now,
under the artificial stimulus of a war boom, is our economy painfully
climbing out of the wreckage of 1937.</p>

<p>Means has no estimate of the losses from unemployment in the last
two years, 1938&ndash;1939. Considering the severity of the 1937&ndash;38
slump, it seems conservative to put the loss in the last two years at
the same rate as in the preceding eight years. This would mean adding
another fifty billion dollars, which would be enough to replace every
residential building in the country, from Park Avenue apartments to
sharecroppers&rsquo; shacks.</p>
