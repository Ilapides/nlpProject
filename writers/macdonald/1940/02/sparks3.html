<h4>Magistrates and Labor Laws</h4>

<p class="fst">Among the states, New York is especially noted for
its progressive labor legislation. In 1886 the first law regulating
hours of work of New York women employees was passed. In the
fifty-three years since then, largely because of the pressure of the
workers themselves, a structure of labor laws has been slowly built
up &ndash; laws limiting the hours of work of women and minors, laws
providing for sanitary inspections of factories, laws providing for
medical care and insurance benefits, at the boss&rsquo;s expense, in
case of industrial disease and accidents.</p>

<p>The laws are fine &ndash; as far as they go, at
least. But it appears that in New York City they are simply not
enforced. The Consumers League of New York has issued a report
entitled, <strong>The City Magistrates and the Labor Laws</strong>, which every
trade union and labor organization should study. This covers all
labor cases heard in the city&rsquo;s Magistrates&rsquo; Courts over
a period of three and a half years (January, 1934 through June,
1937).</p>

<p><em>Two out of every three of the employers who were
brought into court charged with violation of the labor laws got off
without any punishment whatsoever. The fines imposed on the remaining
third averaged $18.</em> &ldquo;In economic terms,&rdquo; the report
notes; &ldquo;this means that the profits accruing to violating
employers were left virtually intact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why did two-thirds of the employers get off without
even a fine? Was it because they were found not guilty by the
magistrate? No, most of them were found guilty as charged. But they
paid no fine because they were let off with suspended sentences. One
magistrate found guilty 46 employers in one session. He fined one of
these $20, two $10, three $5, and he let the remaining 40 off scot
free with suspended sentences.</p>

<p>These are the same magistrates whose high salaries
and political corruption have been a scandal for years, the same
dispensers of &ldquo;justice&rdquo; who daily hand out heavy fines
and jail sentences to strikers, pickets and left-wing demonstrators.
It is time the unions did something about the perversion of justice
in the city&rsquo;s Magistrates&rsquo; Courts.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The First Step</h4>

<p class="fst">As this is written, the War Deal&rsquo;s campaign to
lend Federal funds to &ldquo;poor little Finland&rdquo; (what about
&ldquo;poor little WPA&rdquo;, now suffering aggression without any
Mannerheim Line to fall back on ?) seems to be on the verge of
success in Congress. The liberal-isolationist bloc is meeting this
first real test by &ndash; joining the energy and whooping it up for
war loans to Finland.</p>

<p><em>What is behind Roosevelt&rsquo;s
Poor-Little-Finland line is bluntly expressed in the <strong>Kiplinger
Washington News Letter</strong> for January 27:</em></p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;Pressure for credits to Allies is
increasing. Congress is sour on such credits now, but many
sophisticated Congressmen privately admit that the move to expand
Export-Import Bank and lend to Finland is a step towards some sort of
financial aid to the Allies at some later period.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst"><em>Poor Little Finland today means Poor Little
British Empire tomorrow.</em></p>
