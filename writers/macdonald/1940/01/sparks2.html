<h4>What Happened to the Workers Alliance?</h4>

<p class="fst">As the Roosevelt-Woodrum-Bricker-LaGuardia drive against the
unemployed shifts into high, as federal, state and local relief
standards are forced down to ever more subhuman levels, many of the
unemployed are no doubt wondering what hit the Workers Alliance. How
can it be that a once-militant union like the Alliance has collapsed
so miserably?</p>

<p>For an excellent brief description of what has happened to the
Workers Alliance we have only to go to Herbert Benjamin, who has been
for years the Stalinist power behind the throne of Alliance president
David Lasser. Writes Comrade Benjamin, in an article on <em>The
Unemployed Movement in the U.S.A.</em>:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;The great masses are still subject to the
illusion that some easy and &lsquo;painless&rsquo; way can be found
of solving their urgent problems. Opportunist elements cater to these
illusions ... They encourage the workers to believe that mass action
is unnecessary, that the leaders can induce relief authorities to
improve relief standards and eliminate abuses. In place of mass
action they employ more or less friendly negotiations between
unemployed leaders and relief officials, who are quite willing to
encourage this kind of relationship because they realize that it will
undermine the power of the unemployed organization ... The membership
is deprived of its initiative, its militancy is vitiated, illusions
are promoted, and its leadership becomes corrupted.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">Comrade Benjamin is not &ldquo;confessing&rdquo;. He wrote these
words in <strong>The Communist</strong> for June 1935. The history of the
Workers Alliance &ndash; a history he himself is largely responsible
for &ndash; bears out word for word the accuracy of his analysis. No,
Comrade Benjamin is not &ldquo;confessing&rdquo; &ndash; but can he
put off the day much longer?<br />

<h4>Socialism Comes to Finland</h4>

<p class="fst">For weeks now the <strong>Daily Worker</strong> has been reporting Red Army
victories in Finland, victories which have been suppressed by the
rest of the press. So, too, with the advance of socialism into
Finland behind the tanks of the Red Army. Of the giant strides
towards Stalino-socialism reported by the <strong>Daily Worker</strong> day
after day, not a word in the <strong>N.Y. Times</strong>. But now at last a
stride has been made that is so gigantic that even the lying
bourgeois press doesn&rsquo;t dare to suppress it.</p>

<p>It seems that on December 11, 1939 &ndash; historic date! &ndash;
the inhabitants of the Finnish village of Karku assembled and elected
a &ldquo;committee of the Working People&rsquo;s Front in Karku&rdquo;.
(The <strong>Times</strong> does not specify just where Karku is, but we may
assume, considering the progress of the Red Army, that it is fairly
close to the border.) This was no paper organization. At once the
Working People&rsquo;s Front swung into action. Boldly, it took over
the goods of a local trading company and, after making a careful
inventory of them, it proclaimed a reduction in the price of matches
from 2 marks to 1&frac12; marks. Nor did the Working People&rsquo;s
Front stop there in its headlong rush towards socialism. It marked
salt down from 2&frac12; to 1&frac12; marks, and slashed the price of
coffee from 20 to 16 marks a pound.</p>

<p>This revolutionary action &ndash; coming dangerously close to
outright expropriation &ndash; was in line with the equally daring
program of Comrade Kuusinen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Finnish People&rsquo;s
Government&rdquo;. It is true the Kuusinen regime felt it prudent to
proclaim their respect for private property. (After all, they&rsquo;re
respectable bureaucrats, not adventurists and putschists.) But they
didn&rsquo;t hesitate to raise such revolutionary demands as the
eight-hour day and even vacations with pay. Nor can Comrade Kuusinen
be blamed if these particular demands happen to have been won, years
ago, by the Finnish labor unions. He hasn&rsquo;t been in Finland for
a long time.</p>

<p>But it must be admitted that Comrade Kuusinen made a bad mistake
when he omitted from his revolutionary program any reference to
collective farming. He had excellent reasons for this omission: he
thought the Finnish landlords wouldn&rsquo;t like it. But nonetheless
it turns out to have been a bad tactical error. For now, according to
the <strong>N.Y. Times</strong> of Jan. 5, the Mannerheim-Tanner regime is
expected to introduce &ldquo;the Russian collective farm system&rdquo;
itself in order to prosecute the war more successfully.</p>

<p>Discouraging days for Comrade Kuusinen, whose revolutionary
program turns out to be lagging behind not only the Finnish labor
fakers but even behind the Finnish bourgeois government itself. But
anyway, matches now cost &frac12; mark less in Karku.<br />

<h4>Correction</h4>

<p class="fst">Towards the end of last week&rsquo;s column this amazing statement
occurred: &ldquo;The handful of families at the top, those with
incomes of over $10,000 a year (more than half the total number of
families in the country) actually spend more each year than their
incomes ...&rdquo; This should read: &ldquo;The handful of families
at the top, those with incomes of over $10,000 a year, save half
their income, while all families with $l,000 or less income (more
than half the total number of families in the country) actually spend
more each year than their income&rdquo;, etc., etc.</p>

<h4>A Little Anthology of War Poetry, No.&nbsp;2</h4>

<p class="fst">The British Broadcasting Company recently broadcast to the Empire
a new war song, which goes as follows:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center" width="400">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb"><em>Run Adolf, run Adolf; run, run, run;<br />
Look what you&rsquo;ve been gone and done, done, done;<br />
We will knock the stuffing out of you,<br />
Field Marshal Goering and Goebbels too.<br />
You&rsquo;ll lose your place in the sun, sun, sun;<br />
Soon you poor dog, you&rsquo;ll get none, none none.<br />
You will flop with Herr von Ribbentrop,<br />
So run Adolf, run Adolf; run, run, run.</em></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">The title of this song, according to the British Broadcasting
Company, is <em>Run, Adolf, Run</em>.</p>
