<h4>Pocket Money for Brenda</h4>

<p class="fst">It costs a lot to keep a debutante in operation. It has been
revealed, for example, that the upkeep and running expenses on Brenda
Frazier will come to about $52,000 for the coming year. At least that
is the amount which Surrogate James A. Foley has authorized Brenda&rsquo;s
mama to spend &ldquo;for the support and maintenance&rdquo; of her
nineteen-year-old daughter next year. (Brenda is still a minor, hence
her mother must get legal permission to spend any of her daughter&rsquo;s
income.) The $52,000 will be spent on &ldquo;living expenses,
entertainment, and social and charitable activities&rdquo;. As
Brenda&rsquo;s mama explained to the surrogate, although Brenda is a
minor in the eyes of the law, &ldquo;she is in fact a grown woman
moving in the society in which, because of her parents&rsquo; and
grandparents' background, she has taken a definite place&rdquo;. Very
definite, in fact just $52,000 a year.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What Is Happening to the Soviet Economy?</h4>

<p class="fst">The question of what is happening to Soviet production becomes
more and more important. The military significance is clear. One
reason for the remarkably effective resistance the Finns have put up
to the Red Army is the comparatively vigorous and healthy state of
Finland&rsquo;s economy. (I am speaking, of course, in terms of
production, not social relations.) According to the January 15 issue
of the Cleveland Trust Company&rsquo;s <strong>Business Bulletin</strong>,
Finland&rsquo;s record of industrial production since 1926 is
internationally outstanding. Taking 1929 as 100, the index of
production for Finland now stands at 162, and even in the depth of
the depression it never went below 80. (The American index, on the
other hand, sunk below 60 at the depth of the depression, and is now
only about 90.) The difficulties Stalin has been having with the
third Five Year Plan, on the other hand, are well known.</p>

<p>But the significance of the breakdown that seems to be more and
more evident in Soviet production goes beyond its effect on the
conduct of the war. The more acute becomes the contradiction between
the interests of the bureaucracy and the nationalized economy and the
more the latter is strangled by the bureaucratic clutch, then the
greater becomes the need for Stalin to cement fast his alliance with
Nazi Germany, which has the industrial machinery and technicians to
prop up a while longer the collapsing Soviet industrial structure.
The tightening of the Nazi-Soviet alliance may therefore be expected
to keep equal pace with the mounting difficulties of Soviet
production.</p>

<p>Since I do not read Russian, I am cut off from the chief sources
of information on this subject. But the <strong>N.Y. Times</strong> has lately
carried a few items of interest.</p>

<p>In a Moscow report dated January 17, it was stated that, although
the State Planning Commission&rsquo;s 1939 production figures claim a
gain over 1938 they do not specify, as has hitherto been the case,
what percentage of the Plan was fulfilled. This would seem to
indicate that the Plan was not carried out.</p>

<p>There were several significant accounts of the blackout which has
been attempted in Moscow. It seems that this was unsuccessful because
of the fact that 90% of Moscow&rsquo;s families have no window
curtains because of the &ldquo;acute textile shortage&rdquo;, and
cannot paste up black paper because there is also a paper shortage.
The only alternative is to use blue electric light bulbs, but it
seems there is also a shortage of blue electric light bulbs.</p>

<p>Another report, dated Dec. 10, states: &ldquo;During the blackout,
robberies and thefts have increased.&rdquo; Theft is a social
manifestation which can have only one origin: unequal distribution
and scarcity of material goods.</p>

<p>In this connection, it is interesting to note Trotsky&rsquo;s
statement in a recent issue of <strong>Liberty</strong>: &ldquo;In the USSR
there are twelve to fifteen million privileged individuals who
concentrate in their hands about one half of the national incomes,
and who call this regime &lsquo;Socialism&rsquo;. On the other hand,
there are about 160,000,000 people oppressed by the bureaucracy and
caught in the grip of poverty.&rdquo; If this is &ldquo;socialism,&rdquo;
as the lying Stalinist press claims, then we have socialism over here
right now &ndash; and even a more advanced stage of socialism, since,
according to the National Resources Committee, the richest tenth of
the nation&rsquo;s families concentrate in their hands not half, but
&ldquo;only&rdquo; 36% of the national income.</p>

<p>Finally, the <strong>Times</strong> of Jan. 19 carried a government report
on exports of gasoline which showed that exports to the USSR jumped
from 48,000 barrels in October to 318,500 in November and have
remained at that level ever since. This increase, it is believed, is
going not to Germany via Russia, but is being used by the Red Army in
the Finnish invasion. Considering that oil is one thing the USSR is
especially rich in, and that Germany hopes to get much of her oil
supply from the USSR, this is startling news indeed. Apparently,
Soviet oil production is in such a bad state that it is necessary to
increase imports of American gasoline <em>six times</em> in order to
supply the Red Army. (This may be due to a decline in crude oil
production, but more probably it is due to the inability of Russian
refineries to produce sufficient gasoline of high enough quality for
airplane motors.) Russian crude oil exports, which were 7,000,000
tons in 1932, by 1938 had sunk to 1,000,000 tons. No wonder Stalin
looks with increasing desperation to Hitler&rsquo;s technicians and
machinery to save the Kremlin bureaucracy from the economic impasse
they are now in.</p>
