<h4>The &ldquo;Break-Even Point&rdquo;</h4>

<p class="fst">Much has been written about technological unemployment, hut I have
seen little discussion of one aspect of the problem: the steadily
increasing ability of American industry to make profits at ever-lower
levels of production. A key statistic in any industry is the
&ldquo;break-even point&rdquo;, i.e., the percentage of a plant&rsquo;s
productive capacity which must be used in order to operate at a
profit. In the steel industry, for example, this is now between 40
per cent and 45 per cent &ndash; that is to say, once the average
steel plant begins to run at a rate which produces 45 per cent as
much steel as it can produce at full capacity, it begins to make
money.</p>

<p>This means that an industry with a break-even point of 45 per cent
&ndash; and in many industries the point is even lower &ndash; can
make profits even though it is producing less than half the amount of
goods its plants can produce. Thus the national consumption of these
goods can be reduced to half that of boom times, employment can be
far below the boom level, and the industry in question can still make
money.</p>

<p>There is another interesting thing about this break-even point:
once production reaches that level, profits begin to increase much
faster than production. If a steel company makes, say $5 a ton at 50
per cent of capacity, its rate of profit at 60 per cent of capacity
may well be not $5 a ton but $7 or $8. Thus it is often possible to
double and triple profits with only a slight rise in production. The
reason for this is that a highly mechanized mass production plant
costs a certain <em>minimum</em> to run at all: it takes about as many
employees, as much coal and water and electricity, as much
wear-and-tear on the machinery, to produce steel at 30 per cent of
capacity as at 40 per cent. But once production is high enough to
absorb these minimum fixed charges, then costs for additional
production are reduced to little more than extra wages and raw
materials.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a id="p2" name="p2"></a>
<h4>Sales Up 58 p.c.; Profits 910 p.c.</h4>

<p class="fst">In the first quarter of 1939 the automobile industry gave a
dramatic illustration of the above point. In that period, the net
profits of the six leading automobile manufacturers were $65,500,000,
as against only $6,500,000 for the same quarter of 1938. The increase
in production, however, was very much less: sales of trucks and cars
for that quarter of 1939 totalled 1,056,000, as against 669,000 in
1938. Thus an increase of 58 per cent in sales caused an increase of
910 per cent in profits.</p>

<a id="p3" name="p3"></a>
<h4>Earnings and Employment</h4>

<p class="fst">The mysterious workings of the &ldquo;break-even point&rdquo; are
one reason for the phenomenon we see today of enormous increases in
profits unaccompanied by any significant rise in the national
standard of living or any significant decrease in the number of the
unemployed.</p>

<p>As the readers of the <strong>Appeal</strong> are well aware, one out of
every five families in the nation is starving and stagnating in the
ranks of the unemployed. And, as I noted here a few weeks ago, only
13 out of every hundred of those dropped from WPA last summer have
been able to find jobs in private industry.</p>

<p>Yet last year&rsquo;s earnings of most big companies were
spectacular. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber reported 63 per cent higher
profits in 1939 than in 1938 ... U.S. Steel lost $7,700,000 in 1938,
made $41,200,000 in 1939 ... DuPont made $50,200,000 in 1938,
$93,200,000 in 1939 ... Inland Steel&rsquo;s net rose from $4,900,000
to $10,900,000. The National City Bank predicts that 370 leading
manufacturers will report 1939 earnings totalling $329,000,000, which
is double the 1938 figure.</p>

<p>If figures mean anything, these statistics mean that American
capitalism can function with the utmost efficiency as a profit
system, simultaneously with the utmost inefficiency as a social
system. And since the bourgeoisie judge the desirability of
capitalism by its ability to make profits, while the workers judge it
by its ability to produce and distribute material goods &ndash; this
being the case, there is inevitably a basic clash of class
interests.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a id="p4" name="p4"></a>
<h4>Mass Production and Mass Misery</h4>

<p class="fst">This class conflict the bourgeoisie, both liberal and
conservative, try to explain away with the well-worn thesis that
American capitalism is &ldquo;different&rdquo; from that of Europe in
that it is based on mass production and hence on the idea of a mass
market. The assumption is that our capitalism must progress to ever
higher levels of production and consumption because only thus can our
great corporations find a market big enough to absorb their huge
productive capacity. Hence the common interest of the employer and of
the employee lies in increasing production and consumption (or
sales). The conservatives repeat, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
&ldquo;What is Good for Business is Good for You!&rdquo; The liberals
talk of an &ldquo;economy of plenty&rdquo; (as against the typical
European &ldquo;economy of scarcity&rdquo;). The New Deal spending
philosophy is based on this conception of the mass market being the
logical corollary of mass production.</p>

<p>It is true that when industrial production falls below a certain
minimum level (the national &ldquo;break-even point&rdquo;, so to
speak), the bourgeoisie lose money and, of course, society as a whole
is in a bad way. But, as we have seen, once the break-even point is
reached, profits become rapidly less and less dependent on increased
production. It seems probable that the future development of American
capitalism will be in the direction of extracting bigger and bigger
profits out of ever-smaller production. (The great aim of modem
technology is to lower the break-even point.) There is only one
political formula for imposing on the masses the lower living
standards this economic development would make inevitable. Its name
is fascism.</p>
