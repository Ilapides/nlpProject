<h4>American Class Consciousness</h4>

<p class="fst">The most interesting thing in the new <em>U.S.A.</em> issue of
<strong>Fortune</strong> is the latest instalment of the <em><strong>Fortune</strong>
Survey</em>. Just how accurate and scientifically unbiassed this
national poll is, I don&rsquo;t know. (It came remarkably close to
the 1936 presidential election results.) But to the extent that it is
an accurate reflection of public opinion, this month&rsquo;s
instalment makes sober reading</p>

<p>That the social and economic conditions for the transference of
power from the bourgeoisie to the workers have, in this country, been
ripe for some time &ndash; this, I think, can easily be demonstrated.
But <strong>Fortune</strong>&rsquo;s <em>Survey</em> would seem to indicate that
this is far from being yet reflected in mass consciousness.</p>

<p>The question was asked: &ldquo;What word would you use to name the
class in America you belong to?&rdquo; To this, 47% answered &ldquo;middle
class&rdquo;, 15% said &ldquo;working class&rdquo;, and 28% said they
didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Another question: &ldquo;Do you think the interests of employers
and employees are, by their very nature, opposed, or are they
basically the same?&rdquo; 56% answered &ldquo;the same&rdquo;, 25%
said &ldquo;opposed&rdquo;, the rest didn&rsquo;t know. Factory
workers, as one would expect, were the most class conscious here:
here &ndash; and yet more of even this section of the masses thought
class interests were &ldquo;basically the same&rdquo; (41%) than
thought they were opposed (37%).</p>

<p>Asked: &ldquo;What do you really think would be a satisfactory
income for you?&rdquo;, exactly half of all answering named sums of
$2,500 a year and under. It is true that even such an income is far
below what most people get today, but to be content with so little
shows a dangerous mood of humility and resignation among the masses.</p>

<p>The most ominous finding was that, while 49% thought anybody at
any time should have the right of free speech, almost as many (44%)
said they would &ldquo;prohibit some&rdquo;. And of these latter,
much the biggest proportion (40%) defined the &ldquo;some&rdquo; they
would gag as &ldquo;Browder, communists, reds, radicals, Thomas,
socialists&rdquo;. The next biggest gag group was the 18% in favor of
denying free speech to &ldquo;Kuhn, Bund Leaders, Nazis, Fascists&rdquo;.
This would seem to indicate that &ldquo;reds&rdquo; are about twice
as unpopular in this country at the moment as fascists. (It would
have been interesting and valuable to have had this same question
asked before the Hitler-Stalin Pact. I venture to guess that the
anti-&rdquo;red&rdquo; sentiment would have been appreciably
weaker.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a id="p2" name="p2"></a>
<h4>The People Reject War</h4>

<p class="fst">As the war drags on, its sterile, futile, reactionary character
becomes increasingly clear to the American masses. In the first week
of the war, the Gallup Poll asked the question: &ldquo;If it appears
that Germany is defeating England and France, should the United
States declare war on Germany and send our army and navy to Europe to
fight?&rdquo; To this, 44% said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 56% said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.
The same question was asked a few weeks ago. This time 23% said
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, 77% &ldquo;No&rdquo;. In the same way, the
percentage of those who think the U.S. will stay out of the European
war has risen from 54% last October to a current figure of 68%.</p>

<p>This swing in public sentiment, which set in a few weeks after the
war began, has forced the Roosevelt Administration to soft-pedal its
jingoistic pro-Ally propaganda, and to backwater on its war plans.
But it would be folly to imagine either that the Administration has
given up its plans for getting the country into the war on the side
of the &ldquo;democracies&rdquo;, or that the present trend of public
feeling cannot be reversed in the near future. No amount of popular
hatred of war will <em>by itself</em> suffice to keep the country out
of the present war. This mass sentiment must be organized and given
expression by powerful labor and radical organizations if it is to
play an important role.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a id="p3" name="p3"></a>
<h4>But Capitalism Demands War</h4>

<p class="fst">Regardless of what the masses think and want, the economic
necessities of American capitalism press the nation inexorably
towards participation in the war. The links of gold and steel which
bind our economy to that of the rest of world imperialism are far
stouter than the simple-minded, provincial &ldquo;isolationist&rdquo;
believes. At the present time, for example, eleven billions of
American money are in long-term investments abroad. Last year&rsquo;s
exports were higher than in 1938, and the month of December, 1939, in
particular, was 37% above December, 1938.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the character of this trade has changed in recent
years in such a way as to link American economy more tightly to
European wars. A comparison of the chief items of export in 1926&ndash;1930
with 1939, shows that raw cotton has had the biggest drop (11%), iron
and steel mill products the biggest rise (9%). In general, decreases
are in farm products and consumers&rsquo; goods, while the increases
are in such war materials as aircraft, oil, chemicals, iron and steel
scrap. In a word, the United States ten years ago was the provisioner
of Europe, today is the armorer of Europe.</p>

<p>There is space here to mention only one other tie: the enormous
flow of gold from Europe to the safe haven of this country in the
last few years. Since 1934, <strong>Fortune</strong> estimates that
$10,500,000,000 of European gold has been received here; of which
only $2,800,000,000 was in settlement of foreign trade balances. The
rest represented &ldquo;a vast, unwelcome entrance of foreign
capital&rdquo; in the form of short-term bank balances and foreign
investments in American securities.</p>

<p>According to a recent report of the U.S. Department of Commerce,
this inflow of gold from Europe has been greatly stimulated by the
war. In 1938 the total inflow was $1,500,000,000; last year it was
just double that figure, namely $3,000,000,000. As soon as the war
abroad becomes &ldquo;serious&rdquo;, this torrent of gold pouring
Westward across the Atlantic will set in motion an Eastward
counter-current of American guns and copper and oil and chemicals. No
capitalist government can withstand the gravitational pull of this
economic interaction between America and Europe. It will become a
question not of whether to enter the war, but purely as to how to get
the country in. And this second problem can be solved by the ruling
class more easily than the isolationists realize.</p>
