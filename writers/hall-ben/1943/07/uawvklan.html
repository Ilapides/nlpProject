<p class="fst">As an aftermath to the pogroms against the Negroes in Detroit, an
eight-point program supposedly designed to make impossible its
repetition has been proposed by R.J. Thomas, president of the UAW.
The following is Thomas&rsquo; program:</P>
<OL>
	<li><I>A special grand jury to investigate the cause of the riots
	and to return justifiable indictments.</I><br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li><I>Construction of park and recreational facilities.</I><br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li><I>Immediate and practical plans for the rehousing of Negro
	slum dwellers in federally financed housing projects.</I><br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li><I>Recognition by management and workers of the rights of
	Negroes to jobs in accordance with their skill and seniority.</I><br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li><I>A grand jury investigation of the conduct of the police
	during the riots.</I><br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li><I>No discrimination by the courts between whites and Negroes
	arrested for the rioting.</I><br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li><I>Creation of a fund by the city to make good losses
	suffered in personal injuries and property damage.</I><br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li><I>Creation by the Mayor of a bi-racial committee of ten to
	make recommendations looking toward the elimination of racial
	friction.</I></li>
</OL>
<p class="fst">It is the elementary duty of the leaders of the most powerful
union in Detroit to offer some solution designed to prevent the
terrorist attacks upon Negroes. The CIO derives its strength from the
complete unity of all workers regardless of race, creed, color, or
craft. The recent pogroms, in Detroit threaten to drive a wedge
between the Negro and white workers in the shops and to weaken the
unions thereby.</P>
<P>But in the face of the actual events, what can Thomas&rsquo;
program accomplish?</P>
<P>The fighting, which began on Sunday, June 20, was the culmination
of a well-planned and organized offensive against the Negro people.
This is the FACT, regardless of who threw the first brick or which
side first attacked a person of the opposite color. The precise
incident or incidents which provided the initial impetus for the
fighting are shrouded in rumor and will never be satisfactorily
proved.</P>
<P>But the events which preceded the June 20 trouble and the very
course of the fighting itself prove that the real force behind it all
was the reviving fascist Ku Klux Klan!<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Klan Organizes Attacks</H4>
<p class="fst">The Sojourner Truth housing fight, the attacks by gangs on Negro
neighborhoods in Ferndale, the West Side and elsewhere, the strike at
the Arsenal against Negro guards and finally the outageous &ldquo;strike&rdquo;
at Packard Motor Co., directly organized by the Klan against the
upgrading of Negroes, all prove that the affair of June 27 was no
spontaneous outbreak by &ldquo;citizens&rdquo; but a direct attempt
by the followers of the Klan to bring their past work to a bloody
conclusion.</P>
<P>In the course of the rioting, white gangs were organized on the
outskirts of Negro neighborhoods and attempted to break through to
beat and kill all Negroes in sight and reduce Negro homes to
shambles. Negro groups formed in their own neighborhoods to beat off
these attacks.</P>
<P>The police established barricades around the Negro areas to
prevent attacks by white gangs under the leadership of the Klan
elements. No such barricades were necessary around white
neighborhoods because the Negroes did not threaten them.</P>
<P><I>The June 20 event was an anti-Negro pogrom organized by the
Klan. The action of the Negroes in the fighting was primarily one of
self-defense. And this FACT is in no way negated by the fact that
Negroes under the direction of intensely nationalistic elements
retaliated against the Klan offensive by beating all whites caught in
Negro neighborhoods and looting white-owned stores.</I></P>
<P>By placing the issue on the basis of all whites against all
Negroes, these elements among the Negro people play directly into the
hands of the Klan and facilitate its work of playing on the
reactionary prejudices of backward white workingmen. The very cause
of the Negro people, and of white workers as well, depending as it
does upon the unity of whites and Negroes in the labor movement,
received a blow by these reactionary and nationalistic
manifestations. Come what may, the Negroes will fight in
self-defense. Only if the UNIONS organize and assist this defense
will it be possible to cheek the development of a trend harmful to
labor.</P>
<P><I>The whole labor movement has the elementary duty of preventing
the reorganization of the Klan by smashing its anti-Negro attacks.
This is a task which is of immediate importance, not only for the
Negroes, but for white workers as well. The very existence of the
union movement is at stake!</I></P>
<P>It is in the light of these facts &ndash; the reorganization of
the fascist movement in Detroit, which is beginning by attacks on the
Negroes &ndash; that we must consider Thomas&rsquo; program.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Thomas Omits Most Important Point</H4>
<p class="fst">Thomas&rsquo; proposals fall under two main headings:</P>
<OL>
	<li>Proposals which are supposed designed to get to the roots of
	race antagonisms by providing greater facilities (housing, jobs,
	recreation) for Negroes and whites; and<br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Proposals designed to get fair treatment by the police and
	courts by rioters of both races.</li>
</OL>
<p class="fst">We are one hundred per cent in favor of housing, recreational and
job facilities for Negroes. But, on the one hand, Thomas&rsquo;
program is completely inadequate for cutting off race antagonisms at
the roots. For that a sweeping reorganization of society is
necessary, a reorganization which will abolish the fear of post-war
unemployment and end the fight of one worker against the other for
jobs. Thomas merely scratches the surface.</P>
<P><I>On the other hand, Thomas overlooks the fact that the need NOW
is for a program to smash the fascist Ku Klux Klan bands which will
be stronger than ever after their recent victory and which will greet
every new advance toward Negro-white amity with intensified activity.
It will plan further violent anti-Negro outbreaks. Thomas&rsquo;
general program hides the need for planning action now to combat the
Klan.</I></P>
<P>Point two in Thomas&rsquo; program relating to the police and the
courts serves to throw the workers off guard. How much can labor rely
upon &ldquo;good&rdquo; police, &ldquo;good&rdquo; courts and jury
investigations when the task of the moment is <I>independent action
by the workers themselves?</I></P>
<P>The role of the police during the affair should be clear enough to
all.</P>
<P>They turned their backs while white gangs beat Negroes to death;
yet in Negro neighborhoods they acted with an iron hand, shooting to
kill on the slightest or no provocation. They permitted Klan gangs to
carry weapons openly on the streets while they systematically invaded
the Negro neighborhoods for the purpose of disarming the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Thomas wants no discrimination by the courts against Negroes
arrested in the course of the fighting. Whites and Negroes should be
treated alike, he says. <I>But the discrimination exists in the fact
that eighty-five per cent of those arrested by the police were
Negroes.</I> This is how the courts interpret &ldquo;equal justice.&rdquo;</P>
<P><I>The police and courts are proved to be stacked against the
Negro people, just as they are stacked against the labor movement in
any decisive contest. To advise labor to put all its faith in
investigations which presumably are to lead to some modification in
the attitude of the police and the courts is to advise working men to
let themselves be trampled on by fascist Klan bands armed with clubs,
Knives and guns.</I></P>
<P>The whole labor movement of Detroit must take warning. What is
needed is defense against the developing and growing Klan.</P>
<P>If the police stand by silently while Negro workers are attacked
by thugs, the Negroes have the right to defend their lives. The whole
labor movement must be prepared to help its Negro brothers defend
themselves, for the existence of the trade unions is based upon the
unbroken solidarity of Negro and white workers.</P>
<P>The Jim Crow terrorists are scabs. Every worker must understand
this and must put an end to scabbery.</p>
