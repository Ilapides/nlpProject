<p class="fst"><B>Dear Editor:</B></P>
<p class="fst">In the August 2 issue of <B>Labor Action</B> you printed a letter
signed by Jerry F. Foch, executive secretary-treasurer of the
Ferndale Labor Club.</P>
<P>Referring to an article I wrote in the July 25 issue entitled <a href="../07/uawvklan.html" target="new"><I>UAW
Should Organise Against Klan</I></a>, the Ferndale Labor Club resents the
fact that I mentioned an attack by a white gang in the Negro
neighborhood of Ferndale and denies that this took place.</P>
<P>The reference in that and other articles was NOT to the events of
June 21 but to an incident which occurred in March. This incident and
others like it in Detroit were important factors which led to the
June 21 outbreaks. The event was reported in both the <B>Michigan
Chronicle</B> and the <B>Detroit Tribune</B>, both papers dated April
3. The <B>Michigan Chronicle</B> writes:</P>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Seizing on a fight between colored and white
students at Lincoln High School on Nine Mile Road in Ferndale as the
provocation, a group of White hoodlums led by members of the Ku Klux
Klan instituted a reign of terror among the colored residents of the
Eight Mile Road community last Wednesday which did not subside until
Friday night as state troopers, city and county officers blanketed
the area.</p>
<p class="quote">&ldquo;During the three-day reign of terror the
Klan-inspired hoodlums rode through the district in automobiles,
firing shots that endangered business establishments along Eight Mile
Road. Windows were smashed in four business establishments on the
highway.&rdquo;</p>
