Smith. But their ire is directed not against Smith and not against the police who brutally clubbed several CIO pickets, but <em>against the pickets themselves!</em></p><p>Briggs Local 212 carried the slogan, &#8220;Drive the Fascist Rev. L.K. Smith out of Detroit.&#8221; The <strong>Detroit News</strong> editorializes against this slogan as follows:</p><p class="quoteb">&#8220;Those who deny freedom to others run a grave risk of losing freedom for themselves and for all of us.&#8221;</p><p class="fst">Smith&#8217;s right of free speech must be upheld, the <strong>News</strong> declares, and adds:</p><p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;The police were not merely justified but duty bound in their use of force to oppose the forcible efforts of pickets to prevent the Smith meeting from being held.&#8221;</em></p><p class="fst">Remember ... the <strong>News</strong> and other papers like it have been denouncing the German people for &#8220;permitting&#8221; Hitler to come to power! If we follow the advice of the <strong>News</strong> we will permit fascists to come to power in this country. Hitler&#8217;s rise to power in Germany was facilitated by capitalist newspapers just like the <strong>Detroit News</strong> here. Like the <strong>News</strong>, these papers misled the German people, taught the people to remain defenseless against the Brown Shirts and denounced attacks on the Nazis.<br />&#160;</p><h4>For Workers&#8217; Defense Guards</h4><p class="fst">Why did the union workers picket Smith? Because he stands for fascism, for anti-Semitism, for Jim Crow and for smashing the labor, movement. The antifascist workers want to protect their own democratic rights and they want to do so NOW. They don&#8217;t want to wait until the fascists get so powerful and impudent that THEY are prepared to initiate their anti-working class violence and to break up workers&#8217; meetings. In 1943, the fascists succeeded in organizing anti-Negro riots which caused many deaths. That is enough. We don&#8217;t want any more of that. If we follow the advice of the <strong>News</strong> we will wait until the fascists reorganize and are ready to renew their violent attacks.</p><p><em>The pickets must not use force, says the <strong>News</strong>. But the police MUST use force, it continues. Why? Why are the police justified in cracking the heads of the pickets in order to defend the fascists while the anti-fascists are not justified in defending themselves against the fascists?</em></p><p>Will the police defend the workers against fascist violence? At his mass meeting Smith said to the police in his hall: &#8220;When you see that scum outside and these citizens here in this hall, you know where <em>your interests</em> lie.&#8221;</p><p>Smith believes that the police have more in common with the fascists than with the working people. He probably reached this conclusion during the 1943 riots when not a single fascist was shot by the police, while many Negroes were killed by them.</p><p><em>The <strong>News</strong> helps the fascists. It would give them time to organise and prepare. It would mislead us into abandoning our own self-defense.</em></p><p><em>The workers must not follow this advice. Instead the union movement must organise the self-defense of the working class through Workers&#8217; Defense Guards.</em></p><p class="link">&#160;<br /><a href="#top">Top of page</a></p><hr size="1" noshade="noshade" width="100%" /><p class="linkback"><a href="../../index.html">Ben Hall Archive</a>&#160;&#160; | &#160;&#160;<a href="../../../index.html">Trotskyist Writers Index</a>&#160;&#160; | &#160;&#160;<a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/index.htm">ETOL Main Page</a></p><p class="updat">Last updated: 28 January 2018</p></body>
