<p class="fst"><strong>The New Men of Power: America&rsquo;s Labor Leaders</strong><br />
by C. Wright Mills<br />
<em>Harcourt, Brace, N.Y., 1948, 323 pages, $3.50.</em></p>

<p class="fst">The American labor officialdom is subjected to a pitiless
examination by C. Wright Mills. These several thousand men,
&ldquo;generals&rdquo; of the &ldquo;most democratic societies of
their size in the world,&rdquo; says Mills in his opening pages, &ldquo;are
the strategic actors, they lead the only organizations capable of
stopping the main drift toward war and slump.&rdquo; Weighing them
carefully against this task, Mills finds them wanting and concludes
his work with this sentence: &ldquo;Never has so much depended upon
men who are so ill-prepared and so little inclined to assume the
responsibility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having proved to the hilt that those who can and should stop the
&ldquo;main drift&rdquo; cannot and will not do so, the author loses
balance in an effort to find the way out. He becomes blinded to the
very guide marks which he himself carves out and loses control over
his own excellent material, ignoring conclusions which flow
inescapably from his investigation. This work divides into two
clearly defined aspects: Mills, posing the role of the labor
leadership within the framework of the problems of contemporary
society, is powerful, convincing, illuminating. But Mills outlining
his own program, and we must add, sketching the purported program of
the &ldquo;far left&rdquo; (Trotskyists), succeeds only in creating a
bizarre fog. This latter part of his work is of interest mainly as a
curiosity which can be overlooked without detracting from the
unquestionable importance of the book.</p>

<p>What is the American labor leader? Mills adds much to our
knowledge, documenting his investigation with facts and statistics
assembled in large part from a series of questionnaires addressed to
all leaders of AFL and CIO international unions and heads of city and
state federations. The labor leaders are &ldquo;of lowly origin.&rdquo;
Most of them began as wage workers, as did their fathers. However,
they come not from the lowest sections of the population, the
unskilled and semiskilled, but from, among the highly skilled
workers, foremen, farmers, or of small businessmen. Many were workers
whose ambitions were leading them out of the working class into the
professions, but who became derailed into labor leadership. Mills
informs us that &ldquo;David Dubinsky, for instance, or Julius
Hochman went into the shop with the vaguely contradictory ambition of
leading the workers toward &lsquo;emancipation&rsquo; while saving
enough money to study medicine or law.&rdquo; Walter Reuther could be
cited as another example. He started out as a tool and die maker who
worked as a leader while he attended college with the aim of becoming
an engineer. He participated in the socialist student movement and
with the depression and later the rise of the UAW became diverted
from his engineering career back into the labor movement. The labor
leaders, says Mills, &ldquo;are, in an unkindly phrase, &lsquo;petty
bourgeois&rsquo; in origin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The union leader &ldquo;organizes discontent, then he sits on it
exploiting it in order to maintain a continuous organization; the
labor leader is a manager of discontent.&rdquo; To maintain his
position he builds a machine inside the union based upon patronage
(&ldquo;porkchops&rdquo;) but at all times he must &ldquo;deliver the
goods&rdquo; to the rank and file. His horizon is limited to securing
this or that immediate short-term gain. He supports the capitalist
system but seeks within it peaceable and cooperative relations with
the business class which will give him a junior partnership with the
owners of industry, security for the union, and higher wages for the
workers. He &ldquo;stands between the company bureaucracy and the
rank and file of the workers, acting as a shock absorber for both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Security for the union he identifies with the security of his own
position which gives him power, a standard of life above that of the
ranks and freedom from the monotony of industrial labor. The
culmination of this stability he seeks by the regularization of the
whole economy to free it of shocks and crises. He therefore accepts
the &ldquo;liberal rhetoric&rdquo; of peaceful cohabitation of union
and industry under the benevolent auspices of the liberal capitalist
state. The New Deal embodied all his aspirations. Becoming its ardent
champion, he helped shunt aside the political development of the
labor movement.</p>

<p>He fears the power of industry in government and is alarmed at the
possibility of fascism but has no long-range policy beyond that of a
quick grasp for speedy small-time gains. He is opposed to the
formation of an independent party of labor and hopes to achieve his
aims within the framework of the Democratic-Republican party system.
His social philosophy gives him a sense of &ldquo;sobering
responsibility&rdquo; which pushes him further and further away from
the rank and file. It is the lowest ranking leaders with the closest
ties to the workers who &ldquo;reflect more hope, expectation and
trust&rdquo; in the long-term development of the union movement.</p>

<p>Modern society is drifting toward war, slump and totalitarianism.
Mills considers the aims, character and ideology of the labor
leadership in this context. The only group apart from the &ldquo;far
left&rdquo; which has a consistent long-term program is the so-called
&ldquo;sophisticated right,&rdquo; that is, the most far-sighted
thinkers of big business. (Stalinism in the labor movement is
analyzed separately and is not considered in this connection.)
Through the Marshall Plan they seek unchallenged domination of world
economy in the interests of the profit makers. They plan for the
militarization of society, the increasing merger of the state,
industry and the military. The cost of their plans, which can
culminate only in a new war which they fully expect, must be borne by
the poorest sections of the population. The labor union must be
either destroyed or completely integrated into the militarized state.
Their immediate strategy is to reach some kind of agreement with the
existing labor leadership to insure the system against a radical,
socialist development of the American working class. They want to
suck the labor leadership into their policy of control by the state
and guarantee a pro-capitalist, pro-imperialist labor movement.</p>

<p>The labor leader, far from standing in the way of this program,
helps to further it by his own ideology which views the state not as
it actually is, the instrument of the ruling capitalist class, but as
the impartial arbiter between classes. &ldquo;The labor leader is
walking backward into the future envisioned by the sophisticated
conservatives. By his long-term pursuit of the short end, he is
helping move the society of the United States into a corporate form
of the garrison state.&rdquo; The leaders of the CIO and AFL, despite
the many differences between them, are fundamentally alike in this
respect.</p>

<p>A powerful analysis and correct in all its essentials. But what to
do? For Mills properly tries to find some mode of action
corresponding to the facts. And here Mills is at his weakest.</p>

<p>The power of the union must be linked with the intellect: such is
the author&rsquo;s formula for describing the task of developing a
union leadership freed of its narrow vision and capable of
undertaking the tasks ahead. The key is the &ldquo;union-made&rdquo;
intellectual, a master of every skill required by a labor organizer,
a research man, an organizer, a political thinker, whose role, says
Mills, &ldquo;would be difficult to overestimate.&rdquo; He will find
labor leaders, appreciative of his knowledge and abilities, who will
listen to him &ldquo;if he does not frighten them.&rdquo; But what
shall these intellectuals teach the labor leaders? Mills does not
really know ... somehow they must sound the alarm against the &ldquo;main
drift.&rdquo; Here Mills is no longer dealing with real men acting in
life with real ideas but with the straw men of his own imagination.</p>

<p>The specific proposal advanced by Mills, in fact his only such
proposal, is the formation of an independent labor party. He takes
consolation from some, of his statistics which reveal that a small
percentage of labor leaders favor the &ldquo;eventual&rdquo;
formation of such a party. Others who do not go so far are intensely
concerned over the political power of industry and the possible rise
of fascism. It is these men who, if they are not &ldquo;frightened&rdquo;
by the intellectuals, offer hope.</p>

<p>But the problem, as Mills should certainly realize, hardly begins
with the formation of a labor party. He has cogently demonstrated how
the labor leadership as a social grouping fears instability and seeks
peaceful class relations. A program which would propose the
abandonment of collaboration with the capitalist class and its state,
for the adoption of a program of class struggle aimed at the complete
transformation of society, cannot but &ldquo;frighten&rdquo; a
stratum steeped in pro-capitalist ideology. The formation of a labor
party would not change the character of the present labor
officialdom. Far from abandoning their social philosophy in forming a
labor party, the leadership will adjust the new party to it. They
will seek to restore &ldquo;stability&rdquo; for themselves with new
political methods, and to adopt a new and more effective (for
themselves) mode of collaboration with the capitalist class and its
State. Mass labor parties have existed in all the nations of Europe,
only to be led by men whose political philosophy was identical with
that of the present American labor leadership. They proved incapable
of stopping war and fascism.</p>

<p>The labor leadership of today, petty-bourgeois in nature, loyal to
capitalism, more and more divorcing itself from the ranks (to restate
<em>Mills&rsquo;</em> own description) cannot by its very nature
become, the necessary leadership of tomorrow. This or that individual
exception, however important, cannot change this fact. A new
leadership drawn from among the militants, close to the rank and
file, trained in class, socialist politics and unionism must replace
them. The formation of a labor party and the political battles which
will be thrust upon it will help raise these elements to the fore.
New times &ndash; new men. Mills again helps us to understand the
mechanism of making and unmaking labor leaders. &ldquo;When something
goes wrong in the economy, then new leaders with other ideas are
likely to rise ... Democracy in the unions ... often proceeds by
upsurges and revolution rather than by smoothly operating democratic
machinery.&rdquo; But he does not fully pose the task of changing the
existing leadership nor state clearly with whom arid how he would
replace it.</p>

<p>An early definition fixes the &ldquo;far left&rdquo; as the &ldquo;two
Trotskyist groups&rdquo; but the less said about Mills&rsquo;
exposition of the purported &ldquo;left&rdquo; program the better.
Readers of <strong>The New International</strong> can judge the expert
character of his detailed description of the far-left program by the
following single sentence: &ldquo;The American left focuses its
political attention more on domestic politics than on foreign
affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He does not in fact present and analyze the program of the genuine
American left with the same care and objectivity as the rest of his
material. We cannot and do not, of course, expect Mills to advocate
our program, but we can expect that before recounting it at length
and with apparent authority he acquaint himself with it and present
it objectively. This neglect is all the more irritating because of
the excellence of Mills&rsquo; work as a whole. It is, in spite of
its shortcomings, an indispensable asset for socialist unionists.</P>
