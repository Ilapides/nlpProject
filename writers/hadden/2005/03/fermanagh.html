<p class="fst"><strong>The Socialist Party have decided to challenge for a seat on Fermanagh District Council in the local elections on 5 May.</strong></p>

<p>Paul Dale, who is well known for his local campaigning work on job losses, cuts in public services, water charges and other issues, will be the party&#8217;s candidate.</p>

<p>When local independent socialist Councillor, Davy Kettyles, who has held a seat on the Council for more than a decade, made a surprise announcement that he was stepping down, Paul was approached by many workers in Enniskillen to run.</p>

<p>Davy Kettyles has also endorsed Paul and will be urging those who voted for him to back Paul and ensure that there is still a socialist voice on the next Council.</p>

<p>Paul told <strong>The Socialist</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;There is a need for a new political alternative, which speaks out for working class people, and refuses to take part in the failure of sectarian politics.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;I am currently organising the We Won&#8217;t Pay Campaign in Fermanagh, which is calling for mass non-payment of these hated water charges. The campaign is receiving great support from people. It is clear the politicians from the main parties have no idea what to do to stop these draconian charges.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;A lot of local workers and community activists have agreed to help out in the election campaign. It will be a tough campaign, but we are determined that working class people in Enniskillen have a real choice in these elections.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Paul has in the past organised campaigns against the closure of the local cheese factory, organised trade union rallies against sectarian killings, played a central role in campaigning against the war on Iraq, organised packed meetings in support of term-time education workers and has highlighted the issue of low pay locally through the End Low Pay Campaign.</p>

<p>Paul is currently a member of the Civil Service Executive and the General Council of NIPSA. He is also a leading member of Fermanagh Trades Council. Paul is married with three children and works in the Ordnance Survey Department in Enniskillen.</p>
