<p class="fst"><strong>The T&amp;GWU have agreed to set up an inquiry into the union&#8217;s handling of the dispute at Belfast International Airport which led to the sacking of 23 workers, including the three shop stewards.</strong></p>

<p>This follows a long campaign by the shop stewards, backed by the other workers, demanding that the union explain why their full time official repudiated the strike, even though it had been balloted for and was an official dispute</p>

<p>In the end it took a hunger strike by the shop stewards to force the union to concede. The inquiry is due to start its investigation in April.</p>

<p>Senior figures from the union including the current General Secretary, Tony Woodley and his predecessor, (Sir!!) Bill Morris are to be called as witnesses. The inquiry team will include Jim Barbour, Executive Member of the Fire Brigades Union.</p>

<p>Sacked shop steward, Gordon McNeill commented:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We are glad that there is now an opportunity for the truth to come out. This is important not just for us but for all workers who expect their union officials to back them when they take industrial action, not stab them in the back.&#8221;</p>
