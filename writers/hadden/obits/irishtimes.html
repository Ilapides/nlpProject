<p class="fst">PETER HADDEN, who has died aged 60, was with Joe Higgins MEP a founding and leading member of the Socialist Party and a campaigner for anti-sectarian politics in the North&#8217;s labour movement for more than 40 years.</p>

<p>Originally from Strabane, Co. Tyrone, his father was rector of Artigarvan. Hadden spent most of his life in Belfast and in 1968 he joined Militant, a Trotskyist element and newspaper within the British and later Irish labour and trade union movement, while studying at Sussex University.</p>

<p>He returned to Northern Ireland in the early 1970s and worked as an official for the civil service trade union NIPSA before becoming a full-time political activist for more than 30 years.</p>

<p>He helped found Militant in Ireland, which became the Socialist Party, and was a leading light in the Committee for a Workers' International (CWI) &#8211; the international body to which the party is affiliated.</p>

<p>Most of his writings, books, pamphlets and many articles focused on Northern Ireland from a Marxist perspective. He argued that the national question could not be resolved in the context of capitalism, but only through a united struggle by working class Catholics and Protestants for a socialist Ireland. His writings include <strong>Divide and Rule</strong>, <strong>Common Misery Common Struggle</strong>, <strong>Beyond the Troubles</strong>, <strong>Towards Division Not Peace</strong>, and <strong>Troubled Times</strong>.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, when many on the left gave tacit support to the provisionals, Hadden vigorously opposed their campaign and worked for the establishment of a labour party in the North as an alternative to what he saw as the sectarian parties of unionist and nationalist traditions. He contested the Westminster elections in 1992 on a Labour and Trade Union ticket and also ran for the city council.</p>

<p>He was active in NIPSA and other unions, promoting strikes and protests by trade unionists in opposition to sectarian murders and death threats.</p>

<p>His campaigning often led to strained relations with trade union leaders whose &#8220;inaction&#8221; and failure to accept the potential of working-class unity, he argued, allowed sectarianism on both sides to flourish for decades.</p>

<p>He was working on a book dealing with these issues at the time of his death after a three-year struggle with cancer.</p>

<p>Paying tribute at his funeral in Belfast&#8217;s Roselawn cemetery, Joe Higgins said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;During my time in the D&#225;il and now Europe, I would consistently ask Peter for advice. On many occasions it was he who armed me with a political edge when I went into the chamber to take on the Taoiseach. Peter Hadden was the giant at my shoulder for 35 years.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">He loved music and football. A keen Northern Ireland supporter, he revelled in the genius of George Best and the music of Paul Brady, Van Morrison, and Steve Earle.</p>

<p>He is survived by his partner Susan, his sons Stephen and Owen and their mother Mary, and his brother David.</p>
