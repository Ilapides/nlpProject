<h3>Towards Division Not Peace</h3>
<hr class="section" size="1" noshade>
<h1>A Problem Without a Solution</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fst">During the 1980s, before they began to contemplate the idea of an
inclusive settlement, the British ruling class had come to the
conclusion that Northern Ireland, as <strong>The Economist</strong> at that
time put it, was &#8220;a problem without a solution&#8221;. By the
1990s they were more optimistically considering that the strategy of
inclusion might indeed bring a lasting settlement. A year and a half
into the new millennium &#8211; and seven Drumcrees wiser &#8211;
they are more soberly coming to the view that the <strong>Economist</strong>
may have been right after all.</p>
<p>On a capitalist basis it is indeed &#8220;a problem without a
solution&#8221;. The &#8220;constitutional question&#8221; is
irresolvable under the present system, more so now than ever. The
antagonistic aspirations of Catholics and Protestants on the national
question are irreconcilable under capitalism.</p>
<p>Not one of the range of &#8220;solutions&#8221; from reunification
at one pole to independence at the other will work. Each one is
merely a different route, albeit at a different pace, to civil war
and repartition. Nor will the <em>status quo</em> hold indefinitely.
Unless the working class movement emerges to provide an alternative
the current arrangements will break down as the demographic and
political scales shift in one sectarian direction or another &#8211;
with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>No capitalist reunification The option of a capitalist united
Ireland is completely unattainable. The million Protestants would
fight rather than voluntarily cut their ties with Britain and become
a minority in an all Ireland state.</p>
<p>While this is the reality it is an idea that cannot be comfortable
accommodated in nationalist thinking. If Protestants can&#8217;t be
convinced to join a united Ireland the choice for nationalists is
either to abandon the idea or else to goose-step them into it at
rifle point. But civil war would not bring a clear result any more
that it did in Bosnia. The end would be some form of repartition, not
really the &#8220;end&#8221;, only another beginning, a re-siting of
the trenches in readiness for the next battles.</p>
<p>Nationalists have always had to find arguments to convince their
audience &#8211; and themselves &#8211; that Protestants will
eventually come round. Hence the idea that the Protestants have been
bribed and duped by Britain and that the privileges they have
received have blinded them to their true &#8220;Irish&#8221;
identity. A declaration from Britain that they were going to withdraw
and a determination to carry this through would act like a political
and cultural antibiotic and all their &#8220;confusion&#8221; about
identity would &#8220;clear up&#8221;!</p>
<p>Gerry Adams, in his 1995 book <strong>Free Ireland. Towards a lasting
peace</strong> strongly argues this case:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Their (Protestants&#8217;) political philosophy
expresses loyalty to the union with Britain precisely and solely
because that union has, to date, guaranteed them their privileges and
their ascendancy ... What republicanism has to offer loyalists
is equality ... The loyalists have a desperate identity crisis. They
agonize over whether they are Ulster Scots, Picts, English or British
... Yet they are not British. Loyalism is not found in Britain itself
except as an Irish export. There are no cultural links between the
loyalists and the British, no matter how much the loyalists scream
about their &#8216;British way of life&#8217; ... <em>The loyalists
are Irish</em>.&#8221; (Our emphasis)</p>

<p class="fst">It follows, as the Sinn Fein document presented to the SDLP in
1988 argues, that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;faced with a British withdrawal and the removal of
partition, a considerable body of Loyalist opinion would accept the
wisdom of negotiating for the type of society which would reflect
their needs as well as the needs of all other people in Ireland.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Wishful thinking is a dangerous base on which to build a
political, never mind a military strategy. Sectarian wishful thinking
is even more dangerous. Sinn Fein&#8217;s concentration since the
late 1980s on getting the British to join the &#8220;persuaders&#8221;
is based on the idea that, if the &#8220;puppet masters&#8221; in
Westminster pull the rug from under them, the Protestants will
eventually shrug their shoulders and join a united Ireland. There is
no acknowledgement that there could be any genuine basis to
Protestant opposition to reunification on a capitalist basis. The
idea, for example, that Protestants fear becoming a minority that
would suffer systematic discrimination, is not even considered.</p>
<p>These fears have always been present and have always ruled out a
peaceful path to a united Ireland. They have been greatly reinforced
by what has happened over the past decade and a half. As far as the
majority of Protestants are concerned the more assertive nationalism
that they have confronted in the 1990s, especially as articulated by
Sinn Fein, is just a flavour of what things would be like in a united
Ireland.</p>
<p>If Orange marches and other expressions of what they see as their
culture are challenged in a state that is still part of Britain and
in which they are still a majority, what would it be like in a 32
County state? Protestants fear that the attack on their rights would
not stop at Orange marches or the flying of flags but would extend to
what is taught in schools, how they would be run, to jobs, to
facilities and to access to services.</p>
<p>As to culture and identity there is no possibility that
Protestants will willingly ready themselves for the straitjacket of
cultural uniformity being advocated by Sinn Fein. It is true, as
Gerry Adams says, that Protestants are &#8216;Irish&#8217;, but it
only true as long as there is a broad and diverse attitude to what
this means. It stops being true when it means acceptance and adoption
of the narrow definition of &#8220;true&#8221; Irish culture promoted
by nationalists.</p>
<p>It is not true that Protestants, while being Irish, have &#8220;no
cultural links&#8221; with the British. This &#8220;either one or the
other&#8221; approach simply does not fit with the more complex
reality. There are cultural links between Protestants and British
people as, just as there are also links between Catholics and the
British, between Protestants and Catholics and between the people of
the north, Protestants included, and those across the border.</p>
<p>Beyond this there is a class identity. The day-to-day life of
working class people in any part of Ireland is closer to that of each
other and to that of workers anywhere in Britain than it is to the
way the members of the Establishment, British or Irish, live their
lives.</p>
<p>Events will determine which aspect of Protestant identity is
strengthened, or whether the class struggle and a development of
class-consciousness will push all this to the background. It will not
be decided by republicans assuming the role of ringmaster and laying
out a set of &#8216;cultural&#8217; and &#8216;national&#8217; hoops
for Protestants to jump through.</p>
<p>Protestants &#8211; and Catholics &#8211; have a right to define
their own culture and their own identity and not to have someone
determine it for them. When nationalists attempt to do this, and to
do it in a hostile way, the only effect is to make Protestants recoil
and assert their Britishness even more.</p>
<p>A British declaration to withdraw would not lead Protestants to
&#8220;accept the wisdom of negotiating&#8221; what would in effect
be their surrender terms. It would provoke an armed revolt and civil
war. If the British government were to cut them adrift and the choice
was between a capitalist united Ireland and an independent state,
established on the parts of Northern Ireland they could hold by
force, the Protestants, <em>en masse</em> would choose the latter.</p>
<p>The 1990s stiffened Protestant resolve to oppose any move towards
reunification. The next period is likely to stiffen it further. In
one sense the 1990s was the most favourable opportunity for
nationalism to win over a significant section of Protestant opinion.
This was the period of the Celtic Tiger when the economy of the south
roared ahead at a much faster rate than the north.</p>
<p>Wages in the south also grew faster; living standards improved and
overtook those in the north. The character of the state changed. It
was more urban, more modern. While the Catholic Church was still
influential it was no longer the all-pervasive force that it had been
in the past.</p>
<p>There was another side, ongoing poverty, corruption, a housing
crisis and a creaking infrastructure, but overall the benefits of the
boom were clear even through the siphon of the northern media. If
ever there was a time when the argument that a united Ireland might
materially benefit people in the north could have been made this was
it. Yet the fact of the Celtic Tiger made not the slightest
impression on Protestant opposition to reunification.</p>
<p>Now the Tiger is beginning to lose its shine. The developing world
recession has already had a severe impact. It is most likely that
there will be, not just a slowdown from the 9, 10 and 11% growth
rates that have recently become &#8216;normal&#8217;, but that the
southern economy will come to a shuddering halt and will pitch
immediately into recession. The tigerish boom is likely to give way
to a tigerish bust.</p>
<p>In the context of what is likely to be a prolonged and severe
economic crisis in the south it will be very hard for nationalists to
sustain any illusion that Protestants can be gently cajoled into a
capitalist united Ireland. While the argument that Protestants can be
&#8220;persuaded&#8221; continues to be advanced as the public
position of most nationalists and republicans the case is made with
less and less conviction.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the weakening of the old argument, Catholics
generally have a stronger than ever sense that a united Ireland is on
the cards &#8211; not immediately but not in the very long term
either. This is an expression of the greater confidence felt within
the Catholic community. It doesn&#8217;t come from the old
nationalist arguments. The new more convincing argument comes from
the changing facts on the ground.</p>
<p>It may not be clearly formulated or articulated, certainly not
publicly. It is more of an instinctive sense that the Protestant
community is in retreat, its ideology is in tatters, its territory is
shrinking and that overall its position is untenable. It is a simple
sectarian argument that, in the drawn out tug of war. The Catholics
are steadily making progress while the Protestants are losing ground;
that a salami style advance to a united Ireland is underway.</p>
<p>The idea has two aspects. Most straightforwardly there is the
legalistic argument that demographic changes on their own will bring
a united Ireland by constitutional means. It is now accepted that, on
present demographic trends, there will be a Catholic majority in the
north at some future point; in fifteen, twenty, thirty years; no one
knows for sure. At that point a democratic vote, so the reasoning
goes, could end partition. Then there is the less &#8220;constitutional&#8221;
variant &#8211; that, as the State that was once a fortress of
Protestant rule crumbles piece by piece, a point will come where
Protestants throw up their hands and surrender themselves into a
united Ireland.</p>
<p>Neither of these scenarios is possible. Unionists today defend the
&#8220;principle&#8221; of consent by a majority in Northern Ireland.
This will remain a &#8220;principle&#8221; for so long as it delivers
the right result for them. If there was a nationalist majority that
seemed prepared to vote for reunification more than one thing would
turn into its opposite.</p>
<p>Nationalists would demand a vote on the &#8220;principles&#8221;
of consent and majority rule. Unionists would insist that their
minority rights should be protected and should not be overridden by
the simple &#8220;consent&#8221; of a majority.</p>
<p>Protestants would not participate in any referendum they would be
likely to loose on the border issue, and would not accept the result
&#8211; just as nationalists dismissed the 1973 border poll as a
foregone conclusion and organized a boycott. In any case it is likely
that the threat of an imminent Catholic majority would blow the State
in its present form apart long before that majority was actually
realized.</p>
<p>The idea that Protestants will wait peaceable for the day of their
political execution or that they will just surrender when they feel
they have conceded too much ground is completely false. There is a
critical point on the road of retreat when Protestants would indeed
see that the game is up for the State as it is.</p>
<p>This would not bring surrender but revolt, and civil war. The
scenario, under capitalism, is not that Protestants will bow to the
&#8220;inevitability&#8221; of reunification. It is that they would
end up in the position of the Tamils in Sri Lanka and that they would
react in a similar manner.<br/>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>No Accommodation of Catholics</h4>

<p class="fst">Understanding that Protestants will not accept a capitalist united
Ireland, the only alternative open to the ruling class is to bring
the Catholic population to a <em>de facto</em> acceptance of the <em>status
quo</em>. This is really what the peace process has been all about. In
return for concessions on equality, on demilitarization, on some
southern involvement and, with a paper &#8216;assurance&#8217; that a
constitutional route to a united Ireland would be left open, it was
hoped that Catholics would, in practice, come to accept partition.</p>
<p>Those who advance this modern version of the old policy of
&#8220;killing home rule with kindness&#8221; fail to take in account
the deep sense of alienation felt by virtually the entire Catholic
community, but especially and most crucially by the Catholic working
class.</p>
<p>For Catholics the Northern Ireland state has meant a half-century
of discrimination followed by several decades of brutal and bloody
repression. All this has left a deep mark on consciousness, a mark
that was never likely to be erased by the concessions that have been
offered through the peace process.</p>
<p>Middle class Catholics, especially the better off sections, would
be prepared to make do with what has come out of the peace process.
For the working class it is a different matter. While Protestants
increasingly feel themselves a minority, and a minority whose
influence is slipping, working class Catholics continue to see
themselves as part of a minority; an oppressed minority who are still
very much second-class citizens within the state.</p>
<p>This view has a real foundation. In the past this was the blatant
discrimination in jobs and housing. During the troubles it was the
military repression that was concentrated most severely in the
working class areas. More recently the intimidation, the pipe
bombings, the beatings and the shootings carried out by loyalists
have reinforced the feeling of being a beleaguered minority. And at
all times this sense has arisen from the poverty, the dead end jobs
and the low wages that have been an unchanging factor for working
class Catholics.</p>
<p>There has been no discernible benefit from the peace process in
Catholic working class areas. The only jobs boost has been in
&#8220;community&#8221; work in the NGO type projects that have been
encouraged by the state and which proliferate everywhere. When the
policy of the ruling class was &#8216;exclusion&#8217; there was a
crackdown on such funding. Such community money as was channelled
into Catholic areas was funnelled [through] the Catholic Church and
similar &#8216;safe&#8217; institutions.</p>
<p>When &#8216;inclusion&#8217; became the aim money was suddenly
diverted to a multitude of &#8220;community organizations&#8221;,
most with some link to the republican movement. All sorts of
organizations found that grants were available to let them employ
full time workers. These openings have mainly gone to people &#8220;in
the know&#8221;, especially to ex-prisoners and others with
connections to the republican movement.</p>
<p>For the mass of ordinary Catholics, outside the public sector,
there is very little choice but dead end low paid jobs. In some ways,
by allowing greater penetration by the state into the Catholic
working class communities, the peace process has actually left a lot
of people worse off.</p>
<p>This is not just because taxes like TV licenses that were
uncollectable in the past are much harder to avoid. More crucially
there has been a crackdown on the black economy. In the past a
significant number of Catholics were forced into the black economy by
the lack of proper jobs. Now some of these avenues have been closed
by the New Labour crackdown on benefit entitlement, and by cheap
labour schemes like JobSkills and New Deal.</p>
<p>There is a sense in which the Catholic working class are
second-class citizens &#8211; as are Protestant workers. This is in
the sense that all workers are second-class citizens under
capitalism. The poverty and hardship that is endemic in Catholic
working class areas is the product of a system based on private
property and run for profit. Religious discrimination is now only a
marginal factor.</p>
<p>True, a genuine &#8220;equality agenda&#8221; has not and will not
be implemented because genuine &#8220;equality&#8221; including
equality of opportunity is impossible under a system whose very
essence is inequality and exploitation. The only way the true
interests of both Catholic and Protestant workers can be served is by
building workers unity in struggle around the problems that are
common to all workers.</p>
<p>But in the current circumstances the objective need for the
working class to stand together to find a way out has been obscured
from common view by the history of the Troubles to this point and by
the decline in class-consciousness. The seething anger in the
Catholic working class areas has had to find another outlet. In the
main it has expressed itself more in a nationalist than in a class
manner.</p>
<p>Among the Catholic working class the peace process has not even
led to a begrudging acceptance of the constitutional <em>status quo</em>.
But neither is consciousness as it was ten or fifteen years ago.
There is the same alienation from the state but alongside this there
is also a feeling that the state is weaker, and that the changes that
are being introduced will undermine it further. And on the other side
there is a sense that &#8220;nationalists&#8221; are more powerful,
more capable of forcing the pace of change.</p>
<p>The end result has not been greater integration but greater
separation from the state. Whole areas in which nationalist flags,
symbols and &#8220;culture&#8221; are predominant and in which
&#8220;policing&#8221; is partly carried out by paramilitaries now
have one foot lifted out of the state. The changes brought about
through the peace process have not pushed nationalism to the back of
people&#8217;s minds as &#8220;something for the future&#8221;.
Nationalism has been strengthened and the possibility of a lasting
internal settlement based on securing Catholic allegiance to a
Northern Ireland state has been reduced even further.</p>
<p>What has happened demonstrates that there can be no lasting
solution on a capitalist basis. But it demonstrates more than this.
After a decade which has seen the construction and partial
deconstruction of the peace process it is clear that it is also
unable of even coming up with any interim agreement that can
stabilize the situation for any length of time.</p>
<p>The peace process, because it was based on the exhaustion of the
paramilitary forces that had been central to the conflict, and
because there was general feeling of war weariness among the
population, was about the best chance for this. Yet the peace
process, while it saw an agreement at the top, saw also the sectarian
polarization increased to an unprecedented degree. All it has done is
construct an even more sectarian landscape on which future conflict
will be all the more sharply fought out.<br/>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>World Recession</h4>

<p class="fst">The events of the 1990s took place against the background of a
period of economic growth. The effects, as is explained earlier, may
have been marginal but such benefits that there were will be much
harder to come by in the period that is now opening up.</p>
<p>Now the world economy is entering a recession that could well turn
out to be deep and, rather than give way to a new upturn, could usher
in a protracted period of stagnation and crisis. While the capitalist
class would like to blame this downturn on the September 11th attack
on the US the reality is that the slide to recession had begun before
this.</p>
<p>This is more than a cyclical &#8220;correction&#8221;. Despite the
boom of the 1980s and the extended 1990s boom that is now coming to
an end the reality is that capitalism has been in a period of acute
crisis and stagnation since the end of the long post war upswing in
1974. A feature of this depressionary period is that while the
cyclical rhythm of capitalism, of boom and slump, has been maintained
the tendency, even through boom periods, is towards the aggravation
of the contradictions of the system.</p>
<p>The accumulated contradictions built up through the 80s and 90s
point to a period of severe crisis, of economic dislocation and of a
contraction of the productive forces. This is now a structural
crisis; what Marx referred to as a crisis of overproduction and over
investment.</p>
<p>It is not possible for capitalism to find a way out of this crisis
through micro economic measures like lowering interest rates or
pumping money into the economy. It is not that these measures have no
effect, they can extend the life of a boom, but, so long as the
fundamental contradictions are unresolved, this is always at the
expense of worse pain later.</p>
<p>The only even temporary way out is through the destruction of the
forces of production that have been built up, through a process of
recession and even slump that will create mass unemployment, lower
wages and, by wiping out the Capital that was accumulated during the
boom, can over a period create more profitable conditions for new
investment.</p>
<p>Capitalism offers only a catastrophic way out that means heaping
misery on millions on working people and in turn strains political
and social relations to breaking point. In face of the overwhelming
economic forces that are pulling the world into recession the efforts
of those like Alan Greenspan of the US Federal Reserve who has been
elevated to the point of infallibility by some capitalist economists
are puny by comparison.</p>
<p>Almost 130 years ago Frederick Engels gave what is a very modern
description of capitalist crises:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Commerce is at a standstill, the markets are
glutted, products accumulate, as multitudinous as they are
unsaleable, hard cash disappears, credit vanishes, factories are
closed, the mass of the workers are in want of the means of
subsistence, because they have produced too much of the means of
subsistence; bankruptcy follows upon bankruptcy, execution upon
execution. The stagnation lasts for years; productive forces and
products are wasted and destroyed wholesale, until the accumulated
mass of commodities finally filter off, more or less depreciated in
value, until production and exchange gradually begin to move again.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The present crisis began in 1997 with the collapse of the Asian
tigers and the economic meltdown that then swept this region. This
was followed by the collapse of the rouble and a similar catastrophe
in Russia. That a general crisis was averted at that point was
because the capitalists intervened, especially the Federal Reserve,
pumping in money to shore up the financial system and maintain the
boom.</p>
<p>But this was merely postponing the inevitable while adding to the
price that would eventually have to be paid for the boom years. In
the recent period the final factor sustaining the growth in the world
economy has been the strength of consumer spending in the US.</p>
<p>The strong dollar, kept artificially strong by the flight of
capital from other countries to the &#8220;safe haven&#8221; of the
US, has meant that the US consumer has been able to buy imported
goods that are cheap in the US market. This is turn has boosted
production and allowed growth in other countries. Two fifths of the
increase in global demand over the last five years has come from the
US.</p>
<p>There is a limit as to how long the world economy can rest on the
single prop of US consumer confidence. Most economists initially
feared that the most significant economic effect of the September
11th attacks would turn out to be the blow it delivered to the
confidence of the US consumer. Whether this turns out to be the case
a blow to confidence is bound to come anyway, if not from the World
Trade Centre attack, then from some other source. Even before
September 11th redundancies and closures were already mounting into
the shape of recession. At some point consumers will decide that the
time has come to stop accumulating debts and to cut spending.</p>
<p>What is developing is likely to be a simultaneous world recession.
The economies of the US, Europe and Japan are marching in
synchronized step towards downturn. The consequences for the rest of
the world are likely to be devastating.</p>
<p>How deep the recession will be or how long it will last are
questions that cannot be definitively answered at this point. There
could be a partial recovery and then another downturn. Or there could
be a prolonged crisis, an L shaped recession that would leave the
world economy bumping along the bottom for a period of years.</p>
<p>While it is not possible to be definitive when it comes to
economic perspectives all the key indicators point in the direction
of a downturn that, perhaps through more than one recession, will be
deep, and to a protracted period of stagnation. It is possible that
there could be a Japanese scenario, a particularly depressing
prospect for world capitalism.</p>
<p>Just as the current boom has been extended due to consumer
optimism, which in turn has been partially based on the falsely
inflated values of stocks on Wall Street and other exchanges, so,
during the late 1980s, Japanese consumers had a sense of wealth that
was also falsely inflated; in this case by the massively fictitious
land values and the idea that credit secured against land was safe
because land prices could not fall.</p>
<p>The bubble inevitably burst and when it did the Japanese economy
plummeted into a period of stagnation from which, despite the overall
growth in the world economy in the 90s, it has been unable to escape.
A series of reflationary packages, with billions of yen pumped in to
try to kick-start the stalled economy, have failed. Japan is now
moving into what will be its fourth recession in ten years.<br/>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How Recession Will Hit the Local Economy</h4>

<p class="fst">Whatever the actual course of the current downturn the effects
will be felt in Northern Ireland. Indeed it is clear that the effects
are already being felt. Just as the growth in manufacturing during
the 1990s was at a faster pace in Northern Ireland than in Britain so
the first stages &#8211; at least &#8211; of the contraction have
been steeper. Between the first and second quarters of this year
manufacturing output fell by 4.8%, as against an average fall for the
UK of 2%.</p>
<p>The high technology industries, where most of such growth in
manufacturing employment as did take place in the 1990s was
concentrated, has not escaped the global contraction of these
sectors. 2001 saw 1,000 jobs lost in the electronic and technology
sector with firms like Daewoo, Nortel, Valence, AVX, Radix Telecom
and Fujitsu all announcing redundancies. In addition many of the 7000
high tech jobs that, according to the IDB were in the pipeline, have
been cancelled as multinational companies have dropped their
expansion plans.</p>
<p>On top of this there is the continued crisis in the textile sector
where the pace of decline has quickened with the latest fall of 17%
representing the steepest drop since 1980. 2,000 jobs are under threat
at Shorts where the Bombardier owners are using the events of
September 11th as a cover for cutbacks.</p>
<p>Agriculture has gone through a period of depression from which it
has not been able to recover. The Northern Ireland Economic Research
Centre (NIERC) estimate that, coming on top of a slump that saw farm
incomes plummet at the end of the 1990s, the effects of the Foot and
Mouth crisis will not be overcome until 2003. They expect
agricultural output to fall by 1.2% in 2001 and by 3.7% in 2002.</p>
<p>Tourism was looked to as the underdeveloped area of the economy
that would blossom in a peace process. Even today some economic
pundits point to this sector, as a recent (October 39th) article in
the <strong>Financial Times</strong> put it, as &#8220;just one facet of an
economic surge that has come as a benefit of the peace process.&#8221;
This article argues that: &#8220;if new hotels are an indicator of a
city&#8217;s health, then Belfast is in remission. In recent years at
least six, including a Ramada, a Hilton and a Posthouse have appeared
on the skyline, and employment in hotels and restaurants has risen 50
percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was written in the wake of what it refers to as &#8220;the
IRA&#8217;s momentous arms move&#8221; and is an attempt to talk up
the &#8220;feel-good factor&#8221; among the business community by
pointing to the possibility of political stability. Yet even the
figures it gives show that, whatever the changes to the downtown
Belfast skyline, the growth of Tourism during the peace process has
been extremely limited. Its contribution to the domestic economy has
risen from 1% to 1.7%, a figure, as the <strong>Financial Times</strong>
acknowledges, that is &#8220;meagre compared with the Republic of
Ireland or England.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaving aside the fact that the jobs created have been low wage,
often part time and menial, those who paint a rosy picture of the
future growth of the hospitality sector do so on the false idea that
the sectarian conflict being waged on a daily basis on the streets is
going to give way to &#8220;stability&#8221;.</p>
<p>They also ignore the general effects of the world recession &#8211;
and the specific effects of September 11th &#8211; in cutting the
numbers of outside visitors likely to fill the new expensive Hotels
in Belfast and elsewhere. While it is impossible to precisely predict
what effect the attack on the Twin Towers and the subsequent &#8220;war
against terrorism&#8221; will have in persuading US citizens to stay
at home, the NIERC estimate that its effect will be to knock at least
&pound;45 million off revenue from Tourism in 2002.</p>
<p>It is not ruled out that the British Government will put in some
additional money in order to try to keep some semblance of a peace
process in place. The heavy dependence on the public sector is likely
to continue. Both the Westminster Government and the local Executive
&#8211; if it continues to exist &#8211; may be forced to some degree
to step back from their present economic canon of privatization, PFI,
PPP etc. so as to allow the public sector to provide a partial buffer
against the impact of recession.</p>
<p>What is clear is that the economic backcloth to the next stage of
the &#8220;peace process&#8221; will be less favourable than before.
The effects of any funding that may be put in will be more than
countered by the effects of recession, especially the loss of
skilled, better paid jobs in manufacturing.</p>
<p>There will be no regeneration or even sense of regeneration of the
impoverished working class areas where the conflict is sharpest.
Services like Health, Education, Housing and Transport are likely to
continue to suffer from massive under funding.<br/>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>No Breakthrough</h4>

<p class="fst">Recession creates much less favourable terrain for new
negotiations and new efforts to keep the Assembly and the Good Friday
agreement from collapse. Yet it was not just the <strong>Financial Times</strong>
that hailed the decommissioning by the IRA of some of its weapons as
a major breakthrough that would put the peace process back on track.
Most other newspapers hailed this &#8220;historic step&#8221; and,
for the first time in a month, the &#8220;war against terrorism&#8221;
was not the headline news.</p>
<p>Even Colin Powell, short of good news given what was taking place
in Afghanistan and the Middle East, held up what was happening in
Northern Ireland as an example of how &#8220;peace processes&#8221;
should work. This reasoning is based on an illusion that, after the
Good Friday Agreement was signed, there were a number of issues
outstanding, especially policing, decommissioning and parades, and
that once these hurdles were crossed there would be both a
comprehensive settlement and lasting peace.</p>
<p>This ignores the underlying destabilizing factors, the growing
insecurity of Protestants, the undiminished anger of the Catholic
working class, the changing demography and the poverty, all of which
together mean that the national antagonisms are set to increase, not
diminish, on the basis of capitalism. The old disputes over parades
and policing, the new disputes over access to schools and the future
disputes on other issues that have not yet arisen, are all symptoms
of the more fundamental problems. None can be fully resolved on the
basis of this system.<br/>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Decommissioning</h4>

<p class="fst">Even the decommissioning issue is not about to simply melt away
despite the fact that, in republican terms, the step taken by the IRA
is hugely significant. As long ago as the lead up to the Good Friday
Agreement the leadership of the republican movement were probably
reconciled to the fact that some form of decommissioning would be
needed.</p>
<p>This is why they went to the lengths of negotiating a procedure
that would allow this to happen away from the cameras, verified only
by the International Commission, and were also careful of the
language, agreeing that arms &#8220;would be put beyond use&#8221;,
not handed over.</p>
<p>For the leadership there has been no question but that the &#8220;war
is over&#8221;. They have long recognized that the &#8220;long war&#8221;
was un-winnable and, once the ceasefire was in place, had no serious
intention of going back down this road. Their sights are now fully
set on strengthening their electoral base, especially in the south.</p>
<p>They hope to make a significant breakthrough over one or two
elections, expecting that at some point they will be able to enter a
Coalition government leaving them as the only party to hold
Ministerial positions, north and south. With this in mind the weapons
of what to them is a former war are just unnecessary ballast that
weighs against their strategy and that would be better discarded.</p>
<p>The problem &#8211; and the delay in decommissioning &#8211; has
been largely down to the fact that the rank and file of the
republican movement were not ready for such a gesture. In the years
since the Agreement the Adams leadership has gradually prepared the
ground for movement on weapons without provoking any significant
split.</p>
<p>Two recent events have left little or no room for any serious
opposition. First there was the arrest of three republicans in
Colombia and the subsequent revelations of IRA links with FARC. This
would not have caused much concern in the working class areas where
Sinn Fein is strong. In some ways it may have helped counter the
notion that the leadership has &#8220;gone soft&#8221; and reinforced
the belief that they have been cleverly pulling the wool over the
eyes of the British Government all along.</p>
<p>But &#8211; whether they knew about the FARC links all along or
not &#8211; these public revelations caused a predictably hostile
reaction among the US administration and those members of the US
establishment with whom Adams, McGuinness and co had long been trying
to curry favour. It is possible that sections of the British security
services, who must have long known about the FARC connection, may
have helped set up these arrests so as to increase the pressure,
especially from the US, for decommissioning.</p>
<p>Then came the September 11th attacks on the twin towers. This was
an event that has reshaped history. The twin towers when standing may
have cast a physical shadow over lower Manhattan. In the method of
their destruction they have cast a political shadow over the globe,
altering world relations. That shadow has extended to Northern
Ireland.</p>
<p>One consequence has been to erase, at least for a period, any
possible basis for a return to a sustained campaign of individual
terrorism. While many workers have deep and growing reservations or
are opposed to the so-called &#8220;war against terror&#8221;
conducted by the US against Afghanistan they remain deeply repulsed
by the horror that was inflicted on New York in September.</p>
<p>The mass of workers in Ireland, north and south, share this sense
of revulsion. This has drained the possible reservoir of support &#8211;
already quite dry after the Omagh bomb &#8211; for any future acts of
individual terror whether carried out by the IRA or by one of the
republican splinter groups.</p>
<p>Republicans who hold to the idea that there should be a return to
armed struggle against Britain face the difficulty that, if the New
York attack did not weaken the US administration, but only succeeded
in provoking the US and Britain to go war, the much smaller scale
activities of republicans could not hope to force the hand of any
British government. In any case the first question asked if there is
any future attack in London or any British city will not be which
wing of republicanism carried it out but whether it was the work of
Bin Laden&#8217;s Al Qaida network.</p>
<p>The September 11th attack was a reactionary act of mass terror
designed to cause the maximum number of civilian casualties. It was
different in character, scale and objective from the individual
terrorism of the IRA, the PLO and other similar groups. Without
prettifying these campaigns all of which resulted in the deaths of
many civilians this was never the central objective. Nonetheless any
future actions by republicans will place them, as far as the mass of
people are concerned, in the Bin Laden school of terrorism.</p>
<p>After September 11th a return to armed struggle was no longer an
option and not just for the IRA leadership; it was not something that
could be seriously contemplated by the republican rank and file. With
the focus of attention diverted for a period to world events the
leadership were able to break with a central tenet of republican
philosophy and put some arms &#8220;beyond use&#8221; &#8211; with
hardly a ripple of opposition from even &#8220;traditionalist&#8221;
areas like South Armagh.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the decommission hurdle has been crossed
or that the issue has been laid to rest. After decommissioning the
issue for anti agreement unionists will be &#8220;more
decommissioning&#8221;. There will be the demand not just for details
of what arms are now &#8220;beyond use&#8221; but for assurances that
decommissioning is a continuous process and for a deadline by when it
will be completed.</p>
<p>It is quite possible that the IRA leadership, perhaps through an
uncomfortable process of fits and starts and of further cliffhanging
crises in the peace process, may put the bulk of their stockpiled
weapons &#8220;beyond use&#8221;. This would create some political
breathing space but, even then, the decommissioning question would
probably not go away entirely.</p>
<p>The war as it has been fought may be definitively over for the IRA
but the conflict is not over, nor is the IRA about to dissolve
itself. It will retain some weapons come what may. With a sectarian
conflict intensifying on the ground and with systematic attacks
taking place against Catholics, republicans are not likely to leave
themselves open to the charge made against their forebears after
August 1969 that the areas were left defenceless. If the peace
process further unravels there will be a tendency for the republican
movement to get drawn into a new war of a different character, a
sectarian war against Protestants. The outlines of what would then
happen are already present in what is taking place at the sectarian
interfaces in Belfast and in towns and villages across Northern
Ireland.</p>
<p>There have already been shooting incidents, some of which have
been put down to republicans, although the bulk may have been carried
out by the INLA or by dissident groups. Should this continue, as is
likely if the situation worsens, and should evidence emerge that the
IRA is involved, anti agreement unionists will set out to ensure that
the loud noise of republican weapons in use on working class streets
weighs heavier in Protestant thinking than the silent and invisible
decommissioning of weapons in arms dumps.<br/>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Policing</h4>

<p class="fst">Just as crossing the decommissioning hurdle is likely to present
more decommissioning hurdles so with other contentious issues like
parades and policing. Unable to get full agreement from Sinn Fein the
British government have decided to go ahead and introduce changes to
policing largely based on the recommendations of the Patten report.
They calculate that Sinn Fein, like the hard line unionists, will put
up little more than token opposition.</p>
<p>The new policing structures represent no fundamental change. True,
it is intended that the blatant sectarian features of the RUC be
erased over time. If this can be done what would remain would still
be a centralized police force: more professional; yes, less
sectarian; yes, but still a repressive arm that the state can extend
into working class areas.</p>
<p>If a renamed and revamped police force has to deal with rioting or
with disputes over parades and other questions &#8211; as is certain
&#8211; whatever new image it presents for itself will quickly become
tarnished. Its sectarian make up will be a secondary question to the
role it plays and the methods it uses. The fact that the RUC is a
Protestant force has not prevented it coming into collision with
people in the Protestant working class communities on many occasions.
Nor has it diminished the anger that has been directed towards it
from these areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even-handedness&#8221; in clamping down equally on
Catholics and Protestants, loyalists and republicans, is unlikely to
build support or make a new police force acceptable to both
communities. More likely, were such a policy to continue, it would
end being viewed with increasing hostility and suspicion by both.</p>
<p>If Protestants feel the brunt of police repression it will
increase suspicions that the state is turning against them: that the
RUC has been done away with so that a new police force could
implement the agenda of &#8220;creeping republicanism&#8221;. On the
other hand if the police are used to clear roads for Orange parades
or implement other decisions that are opposed by nationalists the
view in Catholic areas will be that nothing has changed: that the RUC
has reappeared in slightly different colours and with different
emblems and a new name but with the same riot shields, the same
batons and the same methods.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein is initially likely to keep an arms length attitude to
the new policing arrangements, refusing to endorse them, but at the
same time careful not to mount enough opposition to prevent them
coming into being. This will colour the attitude of the Catholic
working class and make it less likely that there will be a flood of
applications from the youth in the more hard line areas.</p>
<p>Over a period the Sinn Fein leadership may soften its position and
nominate a representative to the new Policing Board using the
argument that this is necessary in order to exercise control and
achieve change from within. This might soften also the hostility of
Catholics to joining for a period.</p>
<p>In the long run even if Sinn Fein were to line up with every other
party in giving a ringing endorsement to the new &#8220;Police
Service of Northern Ireland&#8221; it would not make a fundamental
difference. If they held to such a position they would find
themselves increasingly out of touch with their own grassroots
support.</p>
<p>In 1970 John Hume and those who were emerging as the leadership of
the SDLP had an immense authority in Catholic areas. They not only
fully endorsed the decision to replace the B Specials with the Ulster
Defence Regiment, they issued a call for Catholics to join the new
force. Years later the UDR had to be abolished after a history that
had made it every bit as hated in Catholic areas as the B Specials.</p>
<p>We can leave open the question whether all the proposed changes in
the policing will ever be fully put into effect &#8211; although it
is very difficult to see how this will be done. The question cannot
be considered in a vacuum. All the proposals in the Patten report
assume a degree of stabilization &#8211; over a prolonged period &#8211;
that is extremely unlikely to come about. Even the proposal to
drastically cut police numbers can only be implemented if the
violence subsides.</p>
<p>The idea that there will be a gradual increase in Catholic
recruitment until the police reflect the overall demographic balance
also depends in what is happening in society in general. There was a
similar intention with the UDR but this was entirely cut across by
events.</p>
<p>As far as the ruling class is concerned the RUC have been
professionalized and are doing the job that is necessary. The problem
is one of image and of composition. Patten was set up to come up with
proposals for a force which would have a new image and a changed
religious composition, but which would carry on doing exactly as the
RUC is doing.</p>
<p>It may be that they will go some way with this in the short term
and that they can hold together a police force that is lifted above
the conflict and comes down against both sides. But, as the 1970s
showed, it is very difficult for the State to balance between two
sides in an escalating conflict. Even if it is purely for pragmatic
reasons there is an unavoidable tendency to come down on one side, to
deal with one problem at a time.</p>
<p>When it comes to the British army the ruling class can more easily
turn it in one direction or another. The army is a direct instrument
of the British state and is made up of people from outside Northern
Ireland with little or no connection with either local community.</p>
<p>With a locally recruited police force it is different. The
recruits are drawn from the working class communities and no matter
how much they are inoculated by professional training and big
salaries they are ultimately subject to the pressure of those
communities.</p>
<p>The strains of ongoing sectarian conflict will reflect themselves
inside the police. Should this conflict escalate, the police, no
matter how successfully it had changed its image or balanced its
recruits, would tend to lean in one sectarian direction or the other.
The more balanced its composition the greater the likelihood that it
would come apart under this pressure.<br/>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parades</h4>

<p class="fst">The issue of parades has been the most divisive and destabilizing
question to emerge during the peace process. Even more than policing
and decommissioning, and despite some illusions to the contrary, it
is not an issue that is set to die away.</p>
<p>Each year the police issue statistics to &#8220;prove&#8221; that
in the vast majority of cases parades are uncontroversial; thousands
pass off without protest or incident while only a handful are
contested. If only a few disputes could be resolved, so the argument
goes, there would be no difficulties.</p>
<p>This wishful thinking ignores what the whole thing is about. There
are rights on both sides &#8211; the right of marchers to march and
the right of residents not to have their lives disrupted by parades
they find offensive. Our position &#8211; for these rights to be
upheld and, where they conflict with each other, for negotiation to
arrive at a compromise acceptable to both sides &#8211; is the only
solution.</p>
<p>It would not be difficult to work out the terms of a compromise &#8211;
if it really was only a dispute over these rights. In a few cases,
where there has been a willingness to negotiate, there have been
agreements that have held and the issue has died down.</p>
<p>Even at Drumcree the Orange Order on paper accept most of the
conditions on marches that we have advocated as reasonable. And the
residents have on occasions said that they would be prepared to allow
the proposal that there should be a parade, under certain agreed
conditions, along the Garvaghy Road.</p>
<p>But in general there have not been agreements, even when
face-to-face negotiations have taken place. The few glimpses of light
that have occasionally registered at Drumcree have soon faded into
the sectarian gloom. The reason is that, for the people on both sides
who are whipping this issue up, it is not really a dispute over
rights; it is part of a much broader sectarian agenda. That is why we
have gone further and demanded that the working class movement in the
form of local shop stewards and genuine community activists should
intervene to put pressure on the sectarian intransigents on both
sides to settle the issue.</p>
<p>The disputes over parades stem from a number of things, the
opposition to the Good Friday Agreement for example, but
fundamentally they are about territory. This is a battleground, the
most pronounced and obvious battleground, on which the long drawn out
war over territory is being fought. It is this that makes complete
nonsense of the idea that it is only a problem of a handful of
disputed parades.</p>
<p>As the front lines in the territorial war change so the areas
where parades are disputed and &#8220;not welcome&#8221; will change
also. Areas where there was no controversy will become controversial.
It is not a problem of four or five bitterly disputed parades, it is
a problem of a virtually unlimited number of potential disputes.</p>
<p>Drumcree provides an illustration of this. Whatever uneasy
stalemate has been reached through steel, concrete and miles of razor
wire will inevitably break down. The outward leg of the Drumcree
parades, presently uncontested, goes along the Corcrain Road. The
Corcrain Road is mixed but the clear trend is for the bottom end,
closer to Portadown town centre to remain Protestant while the upper
part of the route becomes Catholic.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Craigavon area plan has designated land for building
400 homes on sites between the Garvaghy Road and Drumcree church. One
is to be built on the side road used by the Orangemen to get to the
church. On present trends these will, without doubt, become Catholic
estates. So the Achilles heel of the Protestant bigotry that keeps
Catholics away from the town centre is that this is fast creating an
extensive Catholic quarter that will within a short period cut off
every access route to Drumcree church.</p>
<p>The point has already been raised in the recent attempts at
negotiations. The Garvaghy residents passed a document to the Orange
Order offering a &#8220;compromise&#8221;. This was that, provided
the Order accepted that it would never again march along the Garvaghy
Road, the residents would agree not to object to future marches along
the Corcrain Road. This was accompanied with &#8220;advice&#8221;
that the Orange Order would be better accepting this now before
demographic changes leave them on weaker ground in the future.</p>
<p>The offer may have been intended as a concession but the Orange
Order took it as a threat and refused. If the sectarian polarization
continues to intensify as it has done since the mid 1990s the yearly
standoff could be in Portadown town centre as the Orangemen find
their outward march to Drumcree blocked. Rather than Drumcree the
word Corcrain could be flashed around the world as a new epicentre of
the sectarian conflict.</p>
<p>What is being enacted in Portadown is being enacted, perhaps less
visibly and dramatically, in a whole number of areas across the
north. Population changes in Belfast already mean that there are very
few main routes in and out of the city that do not pass through what
are now mainly Catholic areas.</p>
<p>Unless there is a movement of the working class to cut across the
sectarian division the demographic changes are bound to fuel further
disputes over parade routes. The intensity of these disputes may vary
but until such times as a united working class movement can cut
across sectarianism the issue itself is irresolvable.<br/>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Repartition &#8211; A Real Danger</h4>

<p class="fst">Parades, policing, decommissioning, and other similar issues that
will arise are all symptoms of a much deeper sectarian conflict that
has been intensifying through the peace process. The survival of the
Assembly for a further period would not mean that there would be any
real political stabilization.</p>
<p>Rather it would be a return to things as they were &#8211; to
sectarian mud slinging and brinkmanship on one issue after another. A
fragile and volatile agreement may remain in place at the top.
Meanwhile the process of division is likely to continue at the
bottom.</p>
<p>Beneath whatever wafer thin agreement is reached between
politicians at the top the conflict is set to continue &#8211; and is
likely to intensify &#8211; in its current form as a war between
rival sectarian camps over territory. Demographic changes provide
this &#8220;war&#8221; with a perpetual impetus. They act like a
cancer eating away at the foundations of any temporary agreements
that may be reached.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, unless a movement of the working class intercedes
to cut across sectarianism, the increased polarization will bring the
whole thing crashing down. This could come through paralysis over
some sectarian issue that may arise. Or it could come when future
election results bring a shift to the more hard-line sections of
unionism and nationalism and make it impossible to elect the First
Minister, never mind his deputy or the Executive.</p>
<p>In the absence of a class alternative disillusionment with the
Assembly and the peace process would take a sectarian form. It would
mean a hardening of attitudes and a strengthening of the more hard
line forces on both sides. This would not be a uniform or an even
process but over a period, if no alternative were provided to cut
across the sectarianism, it would be an unmistakable trend.</p>
<p>On the Catholic side this would likely take the form of the
development of confrontational moods and the strengthening of those
voices that echoed these moods. If the Sinn Fein leadership continued
on the present &#8220;constitutional&#8221; road, putting their
relations with establishment figures in the US and elsewhere, and
their desire to end up in government in the south, above the
pressures of the Catholic community, they could end up out of touch;
much as Yassir Arafat has ended out of touch with the increasingly
combative Palestinian population in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
<p>If this happened divisions would open within Sinn Fein, but not in
the form of an opposition developing and moving to the left. Nor
would those dissidents arguing for a return to the armed struggle
gain much of an echo. Rather the main opposition would be from the
most trenchant sectarians; those engaged in the day to day
confrontations at the sectarian interfaces and over issues like
parades, and who would be opposed to any pulling back by the
leadership on these questions.</p>
<p>It is looking too far ahead to try to judge whether Sinn Fein as a
whole would respond by pulling back from the search for a political
accommodation in the north or whether the dissent that would develop
would lead to serious fractures. What is certain is that the Sinn
Fein leadership will not be able indefinitely to tie the Catholic
community to support a political and &#8220;peace&#8221; process on
the promise that it contains a &#8220;dynamic&#8221; for change that
does not come.</p>
<p>Likewise on the Protestant side &#8211; and again unless class
issues come to the fore and throw the tendency to increased
polarization into reverse &#8211; the future unravelling of the peace
process is likely to see hard line voices strengthened at the expense
of the message that was put forward by the PUP in the earlier, more
hopeful, period when they emerged as a force. As has already been
explained it is clear that the more polarized situation that
developed since the mid 1990s has thwarted the PUP&#8217;s rise.</p>
<p>An uneasy stand off has emerged between the UVF and the UDA/LVF.
No clear victors emerged from the bitter feud that was fought out
mainly in North and West Belfast in the summer of 2000. Rather it
resulted in a clearer division of territory between these groupings,
an inter-factional repartition within the context of overall process
of creeping repartition along the fault line of religion. Although
this feud was called off the bitter rivalry and the struggle between
these groups for territory continues to be fought out in low
intensity clashes and occasional killings across much of the north.</p>
<p>Individual PUP leaders like David Irvine and Billy Hutchinson have
been able to retain a significant base of support but the party was
not able to make significant inroads outside their constituencies.
Among the mass of the Protestant working class Ervine and Hutchinson
have far more respect than the anti agreement loyalists regrouping
against them in the UDA and LVF. The broad view of Protestants is
correctly that these are mainly thugs who are run by drug dealing
barons who have grown rich out of the Troubles.</p>
<p>But among the alienated Protestant youth, the constituency where
the UVF competes for recruits with the UDA/LVF, there is clearly a
drift to the more hard-line organization. Young people who are
spoiling for a fight are more like to join the organisation that
appears to be fighting &#8211; as the Official IRA found after their
1973 ceasefire.</p>
<p>Unless the working class offers young working class Protestants
the hope that, through a different kind of struggle, they can achieve
a decent future, there is a danger that the lumpenisation of areas
and the penetration of drugs will tilt the paramilitary balance
towards the UDA/LVF. Alternatively the UVF may feel compelled to put
themselves forward as the real &#8220;defenders&#8221; of Protestant
areas and their cease-fire may come under impossible strain</p>
<p>Capitalism has no answer, neither for the short term nor for the
long term. Only the working class, uniting in struggle for a
socialist solution, can offer a way out. It this is not done the
present &#8220;repartition&#8221; process will continue. Again unless
this is cut across it will lead ultimately to civil war and actual
repartition.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago a civil war would have meant the expulsion of
most of the Catholic population from the north and the creation of a
truncated state with an overwhelmingly Protestant population. Many of
the Catholics would have ended up, Palestinian style, as refugees
living across the new border in a southern state that would have been
unable to absorb them. And Middle East style instability would have
been the result.</p>
<p>Today the changed demography means that there would be a somewhat
different outcome. Depending on where the boundaries are drawn a
majority of the population of Belfast are now Catholic. Civil war
would more likely end in the border areas and much of the west
separating from the state but elsewhere in a Bosnian type patchwork
including the possible partition of Belfast.</p>
<p>This nightmare scenario would be a massive defeat for the working
class movement throughout Ireland. It would throw back the movement
in Britain also. The question of questions is whether or not the
working class will be able to prevent this disaster from taking
place.</p>
