<p class="fst">With the annoucement of a loyalist ceasefire the guns of all the major paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland have fallen silent. In both Protestant and Catholic areas the reaction has been the same &#8211; a sense of immense relief that after 25 years the killing may be over.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it gives the young people a chance to grow up without the violence it&#8217;s a good thing&#8221; is the response of working-class people whether Catholic or Protestant.</p>

<p>There is now a widespread feeling that the &#8220;Troubles&#8221; must be put behind us; that the politicians and paramilitaries must sit down and talk.</p>

<p>There will be talks. The British government will open the door to Sinn Fein participation. Loyalist paramilitaries, in some political guise, will also be present. It&#8217;s even likely that agreement will be reached on a new political framework including a power-sharing assembly and some degree of Dublin involvement.</p>

<p>But they&#8217;ll have an agreement, not a solution.</p>

<p>The IRA called their ceasefire giving the clear impression that the way was now open by political means to a united Ireland. Ex-UVF leader Gusty Spence, in reading the loyalist ceasefire statement, jabbed his finger in emphasis of the line &#8217;the union is safe&#8217;. Both cannot be right. And in this difference lies the seeds of future conflict unless an alternative can be found.</p>

<p>The hope felt by many, that the politicians, paramilitaries and right-wing London and Dublin governments who have kept the conflict going for decades will now bring about a solution, is a false one.</p>

<p>They have no answer to the endemic poverty and mass unemployment which afflicts working-class areas, both Catholic and Protestant. And there will be no lasting solution which does not provide jobs and a secure and decent future to both Protestant and Catholic workers.</p>

<p>A solution has not been found but there now exists the best opportunity for class politics, for working-class unity and for socialism, since the Troubles began. Already the idea of building a new political organisation to represent the working class is being well received.</p>

<p>October&#8217;s meeting of the Belfast Trades Council debated a motion from the postal workers&#8217; union branch calling for the labour movement to take a political initiative.</p>

<p>It should include putting forward candidates for the likely assembly elections, they said.</p>

<p>At the end there was a tied vote and the motion was referred back to the executive committee and will be re-discussed next month. The health branch of MSF has passed a similar motion and other union branches and trades councils are discussing it.</p>

<p>Militant Labour is talking to a number of individuals and groups to see if a joint campaign can be launched.</p>

<p>This is the real way to peace &#8211; not sectarians and Tories linking arms &#8211; but the working class coming together in a new socialist organisation to jointly combat poverty, state repression and to fight for a socialist Ireland.</p>
