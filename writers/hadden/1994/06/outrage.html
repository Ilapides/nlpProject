<p class="info">From <strong>Militant</strong> [UK], No.&#160;1187, 24 June 1994.<br />

<p class="fst">Six dead. Others fighting for their lives in hospital. Eleven out of twenty four locals enjoying the Ireland <em>vs.</em> Italy game, hit by gunfire. Inside, a scene so harrowing that TV pictures could not be broadcast.</p>

<p>Among the bodies lying on the floor of O&#8217;Toole&#8217;s cramped lounge bar is that of Barney Green, at 87 years old the oldest victim of the 25 years of violence.</p>

<p>Loughinisland &#8211; transformed in a few seconds of carnage from a tranquil County Down hamlet into yet another word like Ormeau, Shankill and Greysteel, evoking an image of horror.</p>

<p>Two days earlier Colin Craig, reputedly a senior figure in the UVF was shot dead by the Irish National Liberation Army on Belfast&#8217;s Shankill Road. Another Protestant also died in that attack. Loughinisland was the Ulster Volunteer Force&#8217;s (UVF) answer.</p>

<p>Their feeble excuse that a republican meeting was taking place cuts no ice with any section of the community in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The two killers were seen laughing as they ran from the bar. This was a brutal sectarian attack carried out by thugs who find some sick sadistic pleasure in murdering Catholics.</p>

<p>Loughinisland has managed to stay largely free of the sectarian divisions seen elsewhere. Laureen Casement, the 20-year-old grand-niece of Barney Green said: &#8220;This community has never been sectarian. We are all totally disgusted, Protestant and Catholic alike.&#8221;</p>

<p>Politicians and church leaders have issued their by now ritual condemnation but in their statements there is not a word about how to end this situation.</p>

<p>Last November it was different. After the Shankill bombing and the attack on a mainly Catholic bar in Greysteel, the trade unions took action. Mass protests drew crowds of 100,000 workers &#8211; Catholic and Protestant.</p>

<p>But since then the union leadership have done nothing. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) are the one major organisation to say nothing about Loughinisland.</p>
