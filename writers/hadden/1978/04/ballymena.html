<p class="fst">On June 8 there will be a by-election for one of the council seats in Ballymena, Northern Ireland. The by-election will be a crucial one for the town because it is the only council actually controlled by the Paisleyite Democratic Unionist Party whose councillor for the area died recently. The balance of support on the council is such that this seat could decide who controls the council.</p>

<p>Last December in the same area (&#8220;area C&#8221;) the Labour and Trade Union Co-ordinating Group fielded a candidate who polled 6 per cent of the vote and the Group have taken a decision to fight this election also. At present, the LTUCG are organising a series of meetings of their activists to discuss the campaign, and further details will be carried in a future issue of <strong>Militant</strong>.</p>
