<p class="fst">On very few occasions has the religious polarisation in Northern
Ireland been greater than at present. With the lingering possibility
of a religious bloodbath never too far in the background, it is
understandable that disillusion and despair have seeped their way
into the working-class movement. Even many active trade unionists and
members of the Labour Movement have lost faith in the possibilities
of building a united class movement.</p>

<p>It is the history of Ireland, most especially the history of the
Irish working-class movement, which speaks out against such
pessimism. A common hack interpretation of Irish history since the
Williamite wars is of a long inexplicable succession of religious
feuds, something particularly Irish. James Connolly, in a number of
his writings, treats such an interpretation with the scorn it
deserves.</p>

<p>In fact, religious divisions have been overcome many times in the
past. The 1798 rebellion stands out as a landmark in this respect.
Under the leadership of Wolfe Tone and the United Irishmen, the Irish
petit-bourgeoisie and peasantry, both the Presbyterians of Antrim and
Down and the Catholics of Wexford and elsewhere, rose together
against the subjection of their country to the interests of the
landlords and capitalists of England. These traditions of unity in
action have been repeated time after time, most especially during
this century with the emergence of the working class as an
independent force.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>1907 Strike</h4>

<p class="fst">In 1907, the Belfast dockers, led by Larkin, united behind them
large sections of the oppressed of the city in a movement which shook
the already tottering Tory-Unionist establishment to its very
foundations. First the dockers, then the carters and finally the
coalmen came out in a dispute that centred on the basic issue of the
right to organise.</p>

<p>A measure of the extent of the sympathy for the strikers was the
reaction of the police. When Larkin pointed out at a strikers&rsquo;
meeting that the police who were being used against them were working
18 hours a day and not receiving a penny extra for it, the flame of
revolt was kindled. A mutiny in the barracks was only finally
suppressed when almost the entire Belfast force was moved to country
areas.</p>

<p>In order to undermine the solidarity of the strikers, the
employers resorted to their favourite tactic, divide and rule. The
&ldquo;Employers&rsquo; Protection Association&rdquo; and the Belfast
press poured out no end of bigoted filth in an attempt to divert the
movement. Larkin, because he was a Catholic, was denounced as an
agent of Rome, while, at the same time, attempts were made to shake
the confidence of the Catholic strikers in the Protestant members of
the strike committee. All the efforts of the employers exploded in
their faces.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&ldquo;Orange split&rdquo;</h4>

<p class="fst">Nothing better illustrates this than the stand made by the
Independent Orange Order during the dispute. Born out of the
ultra-bigoted Belfast Protestant Association, the Independent Orange
Order drew its support from the working-class Protestants. Just as
Ian Paisley today has won much of the working-class support once
enjoyed by the Unionist&rsquo;s, so the Independent Orange Order and
its predecessor reaped the rewards of the disgust felt by the workers
of Belfast for the Conservative policies of the Grand Lodge.</p>

<p>Throughout their propaganda there runs a basic class current, the
attacks made on the Orange leaders as merchants, JPs, etc. is an
example. Long before the 1907 dispute, the orientation of the
Independent Orange Order had swung 180 degrees away from its bigoted
roots. During the July 12th celebrations which coincided with the
1907 strike, the meeting of the Grand Lodge did not even mention the
strike. At the same time, the Independent Orange Order at their
traditional meeting, not only passed a motion pledging solidarity
with the strikers but also collected &pound;50 for the strike fund.</p>

<p>Throughout the dispute, Lindsay Crawford and other leaders of the
Independent Orange Order played an active role assisting the strike
committee. After the defeat of the strike, the Independent Orange
Order eventually collapsed. But the Protestant workers did not
immediately return to their old masters. Class traditions are not so
easily shaken off. Most, left without a political direction, turned
towards the Labour Party, a fact which gives a good indication of the
possibilities of winning the Paisleyite workers to a class programme
which will open up in the future.</p>

<p>In 1919, Belfast was in the front line during the struggle for a
reduction of the working week. In the longest and most bitter dispute
in the city&rsquo;s history, the engineering and shipyard workers and
corporation employees held out for a month in support of their demand
for a 44 hour week. During that time the city was without gas,
electricity or trams. Industry was brought to a standstill. 20,000
had to be laid off, adding to the 40,000 who were on strike. Had the
transport workers joined the strikers, a general strike situation
would have existed. In more ways than one, the shade of 1907 was
raised. Protestant and Catholic stood side by side against their
common class enemy. Yet it was not for want of effort on the part of
the employers that solidarity was maintained. The press repeated the
slanders of 1907; calling at the same time for the most vicious
repression of the strikers, jailing of the strike committee, etc. The
leaders of the Orange Order joined with the bosses in attempting to
cripple the strike.</p>

<p>Early in the dispute they issued an appeal to their members who
were involved, urging them to return to work and negotiate
peacefully. But the reservoirs of reaction at the hands of the ruling
class did not succeed in provoking religious terror.</p>

<p>Even the members of the Orange Order on the strike committee
joined with their comrades in denouncing the intervention of the
Grand Lodge. It was only with the use of troops and after the defeat
of the movement in Britain, that the workers of Belfast conceded
defeat. The mood of militancy, however, lingered. On May Day in 1919,
months after the return to work, 100,000 took part in the march
through Belfast. As in 1907, the workers who had tested their class
power, if only for a period, looked for a political lead not to the
champions of &ldquo;Protestantism&rdquo; but towards the Labour
Movement. In the 1920 Corporation elections, out of the 20 Labour
candidates nominated, 13 were returned, significantly enough the
candidates for Shankill and St Annes, both of whom had been members
of the strike committee, topping the poll.</p>

<p>In the late 1920s and early 1930s the growth of the Unemployed
Workers&rsquo; Movement heralded a new era in which class issues took
precedence. The international crisis in capitalism affected the
northern economy with a vengeance. Shipbuilding, linen and farming
all slumped drastically, creating a vast army of over 100,000
unemployed. For the bosses, desperate measures were required to
safeguard their position. As with the early movements and in the
early twenties, bigotry was seized upon as their most effective
weapon. It is no idle coincidence that this period witnessed the
abolition of proportional representation, the provocative speeches of
the Unionist leaders and the formation of the Ulster Protestant
League which adjured its supporters to have nothing to do with
Catholics, most especially not to employ them.</p>

<p>In an orgy of bigotry, the paid agents of capital attempted to
instil a &ldquo;colon&rdquo; mentality into the minds of Protestants.
But to the unemployed Protestants, the squalid assurances of their
leaders proved no substitute for a job, decent wages and decent
conditions. Unity in the struggle against unemployment culminated in
1932 when an unemployment march was batoned away from the city centre
into the Falls area, an attempt to paint the movement as purely
Catholic and use the Protestants to help crush it. However, instead
of helping the police instigate a religious pogrom, the people of the
Shankill joined hands with the Catholic workers in beating off the
police attacks.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Class solidarity</h4>

<p class="fst">Tim Pat Coogan in his book on the IRA quotes one member of the
army council, recollecting their intervention: &ldquo;We put guns
into the hands of Orangemen to use against the B-specials.&rdquo; As
late as 1934 the basic class ties remained. When socialists around
the Republican Congress groupings formed a James Connolly club for
the unemployed of Belfast, support was forthcoming from Protestants
and Catholics. A large contingent from the Shankill Road took part in
that year&rsquo;s Wolfe Tone commemorations at Bodenstown, marching
under banners Saying &ldquo;Break the connection with capitalism&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Connolly&rsquo;s message our ideal&rdquo;. From this the
mood of the advanced workers of the city can be surmised. Criminally,
however, the antics of the old IRA at Bodenstown only helped to
reinforce the old divisions. Bitterness in the republican movement
remained between the IRA and the various socialist groups who had
broken away from it and eventually formed the Republican Congress. At
Bodenstown, the hostility over spilled into violence when the
Congress group were attacked by the Tipperary IRA. The resulting
battle inevitably turned into a fight between the Tipperary Catholics
and the Protestants from Shankill. No one incident better illustrates
the way in which the tactics of sections of the republicans can
successfully alienate even the best of the Protestant workers.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>1969 Joint Committees</h4>

<p class="fst">These are only the most outstanding examples of unity in action.
Contrary to the views expressed by many people today, they are not
mere drops in an ocean of bitterness.</p>

<p>During these periods, the class solidarity, which is always
present at least as an under-current, shows itself most vividly to
the fore. Today the definite signs of solidarity are clearly only
straws in the wind. But despite this, real potential initially did
exist for the building of a strong working-class movement capable of
counteracting sectarianism and imposing its own solution.</p>

<p>In August 1969 this was clearly shown. Weeks of bloody fighting in
West Belfast preceded the intervention by the British Army. During
this period and after, working-class groups took the initiative in
protecting their own areas. As Hooker Street, Butler Street, the
Falls and other areas burned, street committees of Protestants and
Catholics were set up in one district after another.</p>

<p>Early in August it was reported that 40 volunteers were patrolling
the Catholic Bone area and the surrounding Protestant streets in
Oldpark. By August 15th, such groups existed in the Ardoyne,
Andersontown, Suffolk, East Belfast and the York Street areas, to
name but some. In this way, religious bloodshed and massive
intimidation was avoided at least in these areas. In East Belfast the
attempts of the intimidators who delivered &ldquo;Get Out&rdquo;
leaflets were crushed by the prompt action of the 100-strong group of
vigilantes whose reply was &ldquo;Stay Put &ndash; We Will Protect
You. &rdquo;</p>

<p>A meeting of 9,000 shipyard workers organised on August 15th by
shop-stewards in the yards successfully prevented the sectarian
poison returning to the yards. In this the basic class sense, of the
workers was revealed. This remains true, despite the fact that the
meeting was addressed by Roy Bradford or that it applauded the
arrival of the soldiers. A condemnation of sectarianism by these men
was not something which suddenly appeared out of the sky, but was a
result of years of successful TU organisation and co-operation on the
shop floor.</p>

<p>The absence of a strong Labour movement from Northern Ireland is
not due to the failure of the working class to struggle. It is a
result of the failure of one successive set of leaders after another.
Nothing else explains the collapse of the 1920 movement into the
pogroms of the early 1920s or the collapse of the unemployment
movement into the bloodbath of 1935. In the same way, the failure of
the leaders of the Labour and Trade Union Movement to give a class
lead during the events of 1969 and earlier explains the degeneration
from that period to today&rsquo;s fighting.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Need for socialist policies</h4>

<p class="fst">In 1969 the <STRONG>Militant</STRONG> fought for socialist ideas
as the only solution to the economic problems, the root cause of all
the violence, and for the replacement of the troops with a TU defence
force capable of combating sectarianism. Had these ideas been fought
for by the Labour leaders, had the republicans directed their forces
towards the Labour Movement on such a class programme, the outcome
would have been entirely different.</P>
