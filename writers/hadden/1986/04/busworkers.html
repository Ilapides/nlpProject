<p class="fst">A spokesperson for the Labour and Trade Union Group Peter Hadden issued a statement in support of the action taken by Citybus drivers at a mass meeting yesterday.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;245 attacks have taken place against Citybus drivers since the begining of this year. These attacks have left the bus drivers with no alternative but to take industrial action. The Labour and Trade Union Group calls upon the leadership of the Trade Union movement to take up a campaign to stop all attacks against workers. Support should be given to the bus drivers from all sections of the labour movement.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Trade Unions and Community Groups should jointly work out a concrete programme of action to combat sectarianism and sectarian attacks.&#8221;</p>
