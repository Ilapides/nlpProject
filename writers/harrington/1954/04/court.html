<p class="fst"><B>Civil Liberties and the Vinson Court</B><br />
<I>by C. Herman
Pritchett</I><br />
University of Chicago, $5.00.</p>

<p class="fst"><I>Obiter dicta</I> almost completely dominates popular
understanding of the Supreme Court. Mr. Dooley, who remarked that the
court follows the election returns, is perhaps the chief lay
theoretician of the judicial process in the United States. Yet
brilliant as the aphoristic approach is &ndash; for instance, &ldquo;The
Supreme Court is a permanent Constitutional Convention&rdquo; &ndash;
it fails even to approach the more complex truth.</p>

<p>Viewed from a distance of decades and longer, judicial personality
and theory merge into a larger movement which is not only sensitive
to election returns and social change but even to the vogue of
specific philosophers like Herbert Spencer. But decisive events may
well take place in the short run. And here, the character of
individual justices and legalistic formalities are of great
importance. A catch phrase like &ldquo;separate but equal&rdquo; can
retard civil rights for years. The longevity of appointed judges,
like that of the Four Horsemen of the Thirties, cannot create new
social movements but it can act as a brake upon them, with very real
consequences.</p>

<p>This is made clear in a new book, <B>Civil Liberties and the
Vinson Court</B>, by C. Herman Pritchett. The period under
consideration is very short &ndash; Vinson was sworn in on June 24,
1946 and died last year &ndash; but in less than a decade civil
liberties were set back in epochal fashion.</p>

<p>Eleven justices, in all, sat on the Vinson Court between the 1946
and 1952 terms. Murphy and Rutledge died in 1949, and were replaced
by Minton and Clark. Pritchett breaks these eleven into broad blocs,
pro and anti civil liberties, on the basis of a statistical analysis
of non-unanimous decisions.</p>

<p>The libertarian group was composed by Murphy (who voted for civil
liberties in <I>every</I> case), Rutledge, Black, Douglas and
Frankfurter. The anti-libertarians included Jackson, Clark, Burton,
Minton, Vinson and Reed. With the deaths of Murphy and Rutledge, the
reactionary bloc gained unquestioned control of the court and they
retain it to this day.</p>

<p>The Vinson Court began with the inheritance of a fairly strong
theory of civil liberties from the &ldquo;Roosevelt&rdquo; Court. It
was stated by Rutledge in the 1945 case of <I>Thomas v. Collins</I>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Any attempt to restrict those liberties must be justified
by clear public interest, threatened not doubtfully or remotely, but
by clear and present danger ... Only the gravest abuses, endangering
paramount interests, give occasion for permissible limitation.</p>

<p class="fst">Yet as soon as the new alignment emerged &ndash; the Vinson Court
&ndash; this position was subjected to attack, modification and
eventual destruction. In less than ten years, a constitutional
revolution took place in the field of civil liberties, and democratic
freedoms had been given an incredibly reactionary interpretation in
the highest judicial forum of the land.</p>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><I>Prior Censorship:</I> in 1931, in <I>Near v. Minnesota</I>
it was in effect held that <I>all</I> prior censorship was
unconstitutional. By 1953, in the case of <I>Poulos v. New
Hampshire</I>, it was held: &ldquo;Regulation and suppression are
not the same, either in purpose or result, and courts of justice can
tell the difference,&rdquo; i.e., prior refusal of the right to
speak on the basis of licensing ordinances was upheld.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li><I>Picketing:</I> in 1940, Justice Murphy stated, in the case
of <I>Thornhill v. Alabama</I>, that peaceful picketing was an
exercise of free speech and therefore under all protections of the
First Amendment. In <I>International Brotherhood of Teamsters v.
Hanke</I>, the Vinson Court, speaking through Frankfurter, upheld an
injunction against picketing for a legal objective on the grounds
that &ldquo;if Wisconsin could permit such picketing as a matter of
policy it must have been equally free as a matter of policy to
choose not to permit it ...&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li><I>Free Speech:</I> in one of the worst decisions of this
court, Vinson held that a Wallaceite whose speech had started a
riot, could be arrested for &ldquo;incitement.&rdquo; As Pritchett
points out, &ldquo;The Feiner case, does, indeed, approve a formula
which can make police suppression of speech ridiculously simple. Any
group which wishes to silence a speaker can create a disturbance in
the audience, and that will justify police in requesting the speaker
to stop.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li><I>Taft-Hartley:</I> the chief civil liberties aspect of this
anti-labor law was Section 9 (h) which denied the protection of the
act for any labor organization unless its officers not only swore
that they were not Communist Party members but also that they &ldquo;did
not <I>believe in</I> ... the overthrow of the United States
Government ...&rdquo; This swearing as to belief is unprecedented.
Vinson upheld its constitutionality in a decision which permits
fantastic limitation and investigation of individual freedom.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li><I>Smith Act:</I> in upholding the infamous provisions of
this statute, the court continued the trend begun in the
Taft-Hartley Section 9 (h) decision. The trial judge (Medina) had
held that the case turned on the <I>intent</I> of the defendants in
their discussion, teaching and advocacy. In destroying the clear and
present rule of the Gitlow case, the court upheld the intent test.
Douglas remarked, &ldquo;The crime then depends not on what is
taught but on who the teacher is. That is to make freedom of speech
turn not on <I>what is said</I> but on the <I>intent</I> with which
it is said.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li><I>Fifth Amendment:</I> in the <I>Rogers&rsquo;</I> case
Vinson ruled that the defendant had &ldquo;waived&rdquo; her rights
by answering an initial question on party membership. Black,
Frankfurter and Douglas dissenting, noted that persons pleading the
Fifth Amendment &ldquo;risk imprisonment for contempt by asserting
the privilege prematurely; on the other (hand), they might lose the
privilege if they answer a single question.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li><I>Attorney General&rsquo;s List:</I> by confining itself to
narrow legalisms in the <I>Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee</I>
case, the Vinson Court managed to side step all constitutional
issues. The result has been the continued existence and use of a
totally arbitrary invasion of constitutional freedoms.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li><I>Immigration:</I> Ignatz Mezei, an alien, has been held for
several years now on Ellis Island. He has never had a trial. He does
not know the full charges against him. The Supreme Court upheld
this. Jackson, dissenting, held that executive imprisonment
&ldquo;considered oppressive and lawless since John at Runnymede,
pledged that no free man should be imprisoned, dispossessed,
outlawed, or exiled save by the judgment of his peers or by the law
of the land&rdquo; has come to the United States.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p class="fst">This is just part of the record. Unfortunately, it is impressive.
It documents a broad pattern of new restrictions on American liberty.
It is fair to say that the Constitution in 1954 is far less of a
meaningful document than it was in 1946 before the Vinson Court took
over. In his book, Pritchett gives an excellent presentation of <I>how</I>
this was done, but he does not discuss <I>why</I> it was done. Yet
these are the opposite sides of a coin.</p>

<p>First, as to the question which Pritchett does not treat: why did
this ominous trend appear in the decisions of the United States
Supreme Court?</p>

<p>Part of the reason obviously lies in the development of the cold
war, in the social changes which took place within the period of the
Vinson Court. Confronted by the ideological <I>and</I> military
threat of Stalinism, American capitalism demonstrated its political
bankruptcy by replying in terms of military force and political
reaction. This was true with regard to the very real threat of
international Stalinism; it was also true with regard to the
diminishing threat of domestic Stalinism.</p>

<p>The court was obviously affected by this political shift within
the United States. In some cases, this is terribly obvious &ndash;
for example, the tragic and fantastic haste with which the execution
of the Rosenbergs was expedited.</p>

<p>Yet, I think it would be a great error to make a theoretical
construct in which this factor of shifting politics is the key to the
analysis of the Vinson Court. The United States Supreme Court is an
unrepresentative, appointive and life-time body. Of all the branches
of government it is the least directly susceptible to <I>short-run</I>
political change. If anything, it usually exhibits a cultural lag
rather than contemporaneousness. Within this context, the period of
the Vinson Court was too short to allow for the working of long range
factors, or to admit the hypothesis that its decisions are a
one-to-one corollary of the domestic and international reaction which
the United States represents in the post-war world.</p>

<p>Yet having said this, having admitted that political factors were
at work but denied that they were decisively so, why did this court
act <I>as if</I> it were an elective body, i.e., in complete keeping
with the reaction of the cold war? The answer, I am afraid, is
undramatic. It lies in the psychology of Harry Truman who used the
court as a place to reward friends and cronies.</p>

<p>But the <I>how</I> of the Vinson Court also relates to the problem
of the relation of the court to social change. The only coherent
debate that has taken place has been among three justices:
Frankfurter and, on the other side, Black and Douglas. The
antilibertarians simply have an empirical gift for the reactionary,
more or less devoid of consistent rationalization, but these three
justices have argued the social policy of the court&rsquo;s functions
in regard to change.</p>

<p>Frankfurter belongs, by the skin of his teeth, to the libertarian
bloc. But this has not prevented him from making a number of striking
anti-libertarian decisions. What was the metamorphosis of this
&ldquo;liberal&rdquo; nominee to the Court?</p>

<p>Frankfurter&rsquo;s change is bound up in his own personal brand
of pedantry. But more than that, it is bound up <I>in his persistence
in precisely those attitudes which endeared him to the New Deal</I>.
Frankfurter&rsquo;s philosophy is one of &ldquo;judicial restraint.&rdquo;
He is conscious of the non-representative character of the court and
he feels that he should bend over backwards to allow &ldquo;legislative
experiment.&rdquo; His is the very antithesis of the conception of
the Four Horsemen who struck down so much Roosevelt legislation.</p>

<p>But when the &ldquo;legislative experiment&rdquo; shifted from
social programs to anti-libertarian legislation, Frankfurter did not
budge. He &ldquo;restrained&rdquo; himself to allow the Smith Act.</p>

<p>Black and Douglas, on the other hand, are moving in the direction
of a judicial theory which includes Frankfurters&rsquo; very sound
worry over the unrepresentative nature of the court, but which avoids
the pitfalls of his civil liberties position. Theirs is the
&ldquo;preferred&rdquo; theory which calls for judicial restraint on
<I>all but</I> matters of civil liberties. These they would argue,
are &ldquo;preferred&rdquo; by the court since they are the
preconditions of democracy. Therefore, in attacks on free speech, the
Fifth Amendment, etc., they would argue that the weight is in favor
of striking down questionable statutes and not of allowing
experiment.</p>

<p>This is far from solving the general problem of the judiciary in a
democracy, yet it is a theory which allows for social
experimentation, counseling only that it may not be experimentation
with basic freedoms.</p>

<p>As far as it goes, Pritchett&rsquo;s book is brilliant, readable,
and will do much to destroy the aphoristic approach to the Supreme
Court. Yet one would wish that it had gone into the <I>why</I> of the
Vinson Court and explored the problems which can only be raised in a
short review such as this.</p>

<p>In the Vinson Court we face, to a limited extent, the close
workings of judiciary and politics. But to a more decisive extent, we
are in the presence of a tragedy which is not accounted for by
structural analysis, but far more by intangible qualities of
personality and historical accident. And above all, in the Vinson
Court, we face a coherent, consistent attack on the very basis of our
liberties, we live in a time which has, in the field of civil
liberties, a new Constitution, and one which is probably more
reactionary than any in the history of the United States.</p>
