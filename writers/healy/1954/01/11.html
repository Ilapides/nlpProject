<p class="fst"><span class="cap">D</span>ear Farrell,</p>

<p class="fst">I have received <a href="../../../dobbs/1954/12/08.html">your letter</a>, the greetings to our conference, and the enclosed note on <strong>Tribune</strong> many thanks.</p>

<p>As far as I can see your letter on the tactics to be employed against the Pabloites coincide with our basic opinions here. We should commence a discussion on <em>international perspectives</em> within the International Committee as soon as possible when you get the draft ready. Ceylon is a special problem and whilst everyone is aware of their shortcomings it should be clear that we must leave no stone unturned to win them to our side. This is a mass party in a most important colonial sector, and for us it poses a major problem requiring great patience and tact.</p>

<p>Whilst I know there is complete understanding between us on this matter, it is not the case amongst our French comrades who proceed in a somewhat sectarian way on this matter. We have extremely friendly relations with the Ceylon comrades in this section and their treatment of our struggle is much appreciated.</p>

<p>You can rest assured that we shall handle the parity commission as you suggest. We will waste no time on this question.</p>

<p class="date">Comradely, Jerry</p>

<p class="fst">P.S. I have just read the statements on the internal situation. It seems to me that the party has measured up to its responsibilities very well.</p>

<p>Everyone knows what terrible conditions you work under. During the last two years you have had to lead the fight on Pabloism, in addition to building a new team of leaders. These factors are undoubtedly behind some of the difficulties. This is a time for everyone to keep steady hands on the wheel of leadership I am sure this will be done.</p>
