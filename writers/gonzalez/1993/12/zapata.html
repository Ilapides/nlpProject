<p class="fst">Mexico in September 1910 was a society ready to explode. It had
become independent from Spanish rule 100 years earlier, yet those who
had fought the colonial armies saw little change in their conditions
of life. The capital, Mexico City, was a city of obvious wealth &#8211;
and a new class had grown rich under the protection of the president,
Porfirio Diaz. But the real beneficiaries of Mexico&#8217;s economic
growth were foreign capitalists &#8211; the owners of the mines and
factories that produced the wealth, or the railways that transported
it to the ports or the borders.</p>

<p>The biggest change was in agriculture. Under Diaz, the amount of
land devoted to export crops &#8211; tobacco, coffee and sugar &#8211; grew
dramatically. The plantations began to look like company towns as an
increasingly impoverished peasantry, thrown off their land, became
labourers on starvation wages. The American journalist John Kenneth
Turner, writing in 1908, found conditions there little better than slavery</p>

<p>In the province of Morelos, for example, one community after
another had lost its lands to the expanding commercial estates. When
Emiliano Zapata was elected mayor of the village of Anenecuilo, he
began to mark off the village lands, distribute them among the
inhabitants and defend them &#8211; arms in hand &#8211; against interlopers.
Later, other communities sought his help. It was the first act of a
long struggle against the destructive impact of an export agriculture
which absorbed food producing land and devoted it to cultivating
crops. The only beneficiaries were those who made the profits &#8211; the
new landowners and their financial backers in the city.</p>

<p>Diaz&#8217;s government sent his vicious rural police against Zapata.
But many of them were already busy elsewhere crushing the strikes
breaking out in the new factories of the country&#8217;s centre or in the
mines of the west, nearly all of them owned by foreign capital. An
increasingly fierce repression could not hold down the lid forever.
The resistance of the peasantry, or ex-peasants, was matched by rural
banditry against the landowners. The workers&#8217; struggles were
encouraged by the anarcho-syndicalist ideas of the Flores Magon
brothers, and the small and medium business sectors felt excluded
from the corrupt elite that governed Mexico under Diaz.</p>

<p>When they demanded political reform, supporting the electoral
campaign of Francisco Madero, they unleashed a movement they could
neither foresee nor control.</p>

<p>In November 1910 Zapata launched his Ayala Plan. It was a
political manifesto, a declaration that the peasant rebels would not
lay down their arms until they were guaranteed their land and the
repressive apparatus was dismantled &#8211; a call for &#8216;land and
liberty&#8217;. Two months earlier Diaz had announced his own victory in
the presidential elections &#8211; again. It was the last straw.</p>

<p>Zapata&#8217;s manifesto was the first act of a seven year period of
social conflict known as the Mexican Revolution. When it ended
officially in 1917 a million people had died and countless more were
displaced. For while almost every section of Mexican society baulked
at the repressive dictatorship of Diaz (who fled in February 1911)
there was no agreement on what should follow. The frustrated middle
class wanted political reform &#8211; a bourgeois democratic national
state that could negotiate with foreign capital for better terms, and
economic growth which would benefit domestic capital equally. They
certainly did not want a social revolution that would threaten the
very basis of property itself.</p>

<p>With Diaz out of the country, the newly elected president called
on Zapata and the other rebels such as Pancho Villa in the north to
lay down their arms. Zapata refused until such time as a genuine
agrarian reform was carried out and the old landowning class was
removed from power in the state. Madero&#8217;s response was to send
soldiers, commanded by the old military leaders, to disarm the
peasant rebels. They failed but in the process the old ruling class
organised a counter-revolution and murdered Madero.</p>

<p>Once again the revolutionary armies created an alliance of hostile
brothers &#8211; united only in their desire to defeat the
counter-revolution. In the event it was the peasant armies of the
north and south who drove the new regime out as they entered Mexico
City in November 1913.</p>

<p>This was an extraordinary moment. It is recorded in a set of
photographs which shows how dramatic the encounter was. In one, a
group of peasants sit in an elegant teahouse waiting to be served by
young women in waitress uniforms who look very startled. They had
never seen the wide brimmed hats and white trousers in such places
before. In another, Zapata and Pancho Villa occupy the national
palace. Villa slouches in the presidential throne, his uniform
adorned with medals, a cigar in his hand and a broad grin on his
face. Next to him Zapata, in a straight backed chair, looks grim and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The photos show that the peasant revolutionaries were in a real
sense in control of the capital. Their bourgeois allies &#8211; led by
Carranza &#8211; were far from the city and divided among themselves. Yet
neither Zapata nor Villa had a political vision of a future society.
Their strategies echoed the aspirations of one section of the working
classes, but not of the class as a whole. They were not prepared to
seize power in the state. Instead they waited, hesitated, and finally
withdrew. Their movement had held power in its hands and then
delivered it to their class enemies who would wreak a terrible revenge.</p>

<p>It was not that Mexico had no organised workers &#8211; they had
already fought important battles in the years immediately prior to
the revolution. There were revolutionary organisations too, but the
prevailing politics within them were defined by a group of
anarcho-syndicalists who were contemptuous of politics and political
organisation. Thus the revolutionaries who made a revolution found
themselves without a sense of how to bind the exploited classes into
a new kind of power. Their access to the working class movement was cut off.</p>

<p>The vacuum of politics could not, and did not, last. As soon as
Zapata and Villa withdrew to their own areas, Carranza assumed power
in the state (in January 1915). Not surprisingly, almost his first
act was to organise the military repression of Zapata and Villa.
Whereas his military leaders inflicted severe defeats on Villa in
April and June of that year, Zapata proved a much more difficult enemy.</p>

<p>This was not because Zapata was a better soldier, but because the
process of political change had continued in the area under his
control. While on 15 January Carranza had issued a decree
guaranteeing private property, Zapata&#8217;s first agrarian reform
decree was based on an idea of the collective ownership of land in
<em>ejidos</em> or communities. Thus Zapata&#8217;s resistance was a mass
struggle, linked to political change &#8211; and that was its strength.</p>

<p>Had news of the full impact of Zapata&#8217;s Morelos Commune reached
the workers&#8217; organisations in the cities, Mexican history might
have evolved in a very different direction. As it was, Carranza
co-opted the trade union leadership, announced new laws on workers&#8217;
rights and mobilised the workers briefly against the Morelos
revolution. A year later, when Carranza turned his repressive
apparatus against striking workers, the stratagem would have become
clear &#8211; but tragically it was too late by then.</p>

<p>Within the walls of the Morelos Commune, by contrast, there was
intense political debate. The sugar mills were taken into public
ownership, the rights of small farmers guaranteed and the property of
the &#8216;enemies of the revolution&#8217; confiscated. A minister of arts
and culture was appointed and a system of credits set in place.</p>

<p>But the commune existed under siege and in conditions of
increasing economic scarcity. The vision enshrined in the decrees did
represent an attempt to marry an anti-capitalist rising with the
needs of a class of small farmers. As the besieged nucleus looked
beyond its frontiers for allies, Zapata clearly began to see that the
key was to forge alliances with workers&#8217; organisations elsewhere.
But his envoys found no resonance &#8211; for Carranza had used the
intervening period to draw around him the new leaders of the trade
unions, the radical bourgeois democrats and the nationalists. An
isolated Zapata could do very little about it.</p>

<p>It was particularly poignant that from his external affairs office
in Havana, late in 1917, Zapata sent a message of support and a plea
for solidarity to the new Russian Revolution. The rumour is that he
sent one of his horsemen to carry the message to Lenin. Whether or
not his message arrived, the lessons of October would have reached
the embattled and isolated Zapata too late.</p>

<p>Zapata fought on. In 1917 a new constitution announced the
formation of a Mexican bourgeois state cemented by an ideology of
nationalism. It united against the demands of the revolutionary
movement whose ideas and practices reflected a desire for a more
genuine and profound democracy based on collective ownership. The new
state pursued Zapata and finally murdered him in 1919.</p>

<p>In 1964 a group of Mexican soldiers murdered a peasant leader
called Ruben Jaramillo together with his family. His organisation
carried Zapata&#8217;s name and it was rumoured that he was the possessor
of some of Zapata&#8217;s private documents. He had grown up in Morelos
too and there were always rumours that Zapata still rode in the hills.</p>

<p>Sadly, there is little doubt that he was murdered. Within a few
years those who had administered the state that killed him claimed to
be his inheritors. They spent $1 million on a filmed version of his
life. But they continue to repress and murder those who draw the most
important message from Zapata&#8217;s life &#8211; that only struggle from
below and a very different society can answer the yearning for
justice and for socialist democracy.</p>
