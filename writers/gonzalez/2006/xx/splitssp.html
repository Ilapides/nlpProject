<p class="fst">Since Seattle in 1999, and the explosive growth of the
anti-capitalist movement, all of us in the international socialist
movement have been sailing in uncharted waters. The one thing that we
have almost all agreed on is that the left must develop new forms of
organisation that can both reflect and engage with this new and
growing radical shift. After 9/11 the explosion of anti-war protests
opened new directions and possibilities. For the revolutionary left,
the potential was enormous provided that we were governed above all
by the commitment to become socialists within the movement, working
with a broader spectrum of forces than we had perhaps been used to in
the previous two decades. That was the challenge.</p>

<p>In Scotland the Scottish Socialist Party offered an exciting
possibility of responding to that challenge. Founded in 1998, with
comrades from the Militant Tendency playing a central role, it was
committed to a project of left unity expressed in a party which could
act in an agreed and united way while acknowledging that political
debate was the lifeblood of any socialist organisation. In that
spirit, the Socialist Workers Party in Scotland was invited to join
the SSP as a platform &#8211; an opportunity we grasped with the
overwhelming agreement of our membership.</p>

<p>The signs were extremely promising, and the party&#8217;s electoral
success in 2003 confirmed that there was widespread support for a
principled socialist anti-war party. It is a matter of great regret,
therefore, that just three years after that major electoral advance
the Scottish Socialist Party has reached a point of insoluble crisis.
The project, however, remains as urgent and as hopeful as it was when
we joined just five years ago. The deepening crisis of New Labour,
the public revulsion against the war in Iraq and Afghanistan and the
assault on Lebanon, the aggressive privatisation of public services
confirm the objective necessity for an open, democratic, mass-based
socialist party. It will not now be the SSP; but it is our hope that
the new formation that we have helped to found, provisionally called
Solidarity, and which includes Tommy Sheridan, perhaps the key
individual on the left of Scottish politics, the majority of previous
members of the SSP, and a number of other elements of the wider
social movement, will draw towards it the widest range of anti-capitalists.</p>

<p>What follows is an account of the crisis and collapse of the SSP.
Its purpose is not to win some abstract moral contest, but to show
that the events which brought about the crisis, while apparently
personal, were in fact profoundly political. They demonstrate that
what was exposed in the course of recent months was a faultline in a
particular model of socialist organisation. The point of this
narrative, therefore, is to identify that weakness as a warning and a
lesson for the next chapter.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>1: The catalyst</h4>

<p class="fst">The immediate cause of the collapse of the SSP was a consequence
of a decision by perhaps its best known leading member, Tommy
Sheridan, to sue the <strong>News of the World</strong>, owned by Rupert
Murdoch&#8217;s News International corporation, over a story concerning
his private life. For socialists, matters of private morality are not
our concern; consensual sexual relations concern only those engaged
in them. We judge our comrades by their political conduct, not their
personal life. The <strong>News of the World</strong> is a newspaper which
publishes scandalous reports of sexual behaviour &#8211; but more
importantly, it is a consistent enemy of the working class movement,
using its pages and those of its sister papers to systematically
attack trade unionists, socialists, and all those who fight
oppression, whether their own or that of others. This is common
knowledge, even among many of those who buy the paper for its
titillating content. And that is why Sheridan&#8217;s victory, when a
jury found by a majority against the paper, was widely celebrated by
working class people in Scotland and beyond.</p>

<p>What caused the internal crisis within the SSP, however, was the
astonishing fact that a number of members of the Executive Committee
<a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> of the SSP came to court to testify for the <strong>News of the World</strong>.
Their presence in the court was not just the result of legal
compulsion, as they claimed: it was a consequence of a series of
actions and decisions taken over previous months which were not only
wrong in themselves, but which revealed a much deeper malaise within
the party. When the newspaper reports originally emerged, Sheridan
asked the executive at a long, fraught meeting to recognise his right
to individually pursue his libel case; instead he was pressured to
resign. An extremely detailed account of that critical meeting was
kept, without informing other executive committee members (including
myself) of its content &#8211; and this account later became the
substance of the <strong>News of the World</strong>&#8217;s case. In the days that
followed several executive committee members distanced the party from
him in a very public way, and leaked rumours and suggestions about
him to the press.</p>

<p>The position of the Socialist Worker Platform at the time was well
known and repeated on a number of occasions &#8211; that we supported
Sheridan&#8217;s right to pursue the case and condemned the mounting
campaign against him. For it seemed to us very clear from the outset
that there was a coordinated and consistent campaign to remove
Sheridan from his leading position in the SSP. The extraordinary
bitterness and ferocity of the continuing attacks on him and all of
those who supported him from within the SSP after the conclusion of
the court case have shocked even the most seasoned socialists &#8211; and
ensured the collapse of the SSP as we knew it.</p>

<p>What matters here, of course, is not anecdotal accounts &#8211; though
the response of the SSP executive committee immediately after the
trial ended was to produce a 12-page document consisting entirely of
personal vituperation and accusations against Sheridan. Its effect
was to convince the majority of party activists that they could no
longer work in a party led by people who could produce such a document.</p>

<p>The question that will be asked is why this happened.</p>
<p>It is my view that the crisis in the SSP has its origins in the
central question of the relationship between socialists and the
movement. Our original optimistic assessment of the SSP, and our
decision to join, reflected its declared commitment to building a
broad, open, mass socialist party. The authority and recognition that
had been won by Tommy Sheridan in the campaign against the poll tax
and his subsequent actions as the sole SSP member of the Scottish
Parliament, were a key contributor to that assessment. And the most
resounding confirmation of the SSP&#8217;s potential came with the
Scottish parliamentary elections in May 2003, when the party won 6
percent of the national vote, a total of 130,000, and sent six
members to the Scottish Parliament.</p>

<p>It was a historic moment &#8211; and it was a victory, in our view,
that arose directly out of the public perception of the party&#8217;s
leading role in the anti-war movement: 100,000 marched through
Glasgow on 15 February that year. It is no coincidence that that
figure so closely reflected the numbers in the election.</p>

<p>The conflicts within the party, although as yet unstated, began at
that very moment of success. The large numbers voting for the SSP
suggested a real possibility of &#8216;opening the gates of the party&#8217;
to them, laying the foundations for a genuine mass organisation. Yet
it was clear even then that there was resistance to embracing the
wider movement, and a continuing insistence on SSP-led and
SSP-controlled campaigns. There had already been considerable debate
between the Socialist Worker Platform and the executive committee
majority regarding the anti-war movement. While we had argued that we
should set out to replicate the best experiences of the Stop the War
campaign and build a broad anti-war movement in alliance with Muslim
organisations, the majority of the leadership rejected that view and
insisted instead on allying with some very backward Stalinist
elements in a recently created bureaucracy which consistently blocked
any grassroots activity from that point on.</p>

<p>That suspicion of the wider forces that had entered the historical
scene after Seattle reflected a sectarian response which was to
characterise the relationship between the SSP and every and any
social movement. Curiously, the election result led not, as we had
argued, to a more open and dynamic relationship with the wider
movement, but to its opposite &#8211; an over-emphasis on parliamentary
activity at the expense of grassroots activity. Parliaments can be a
useful propaganda platform in the building of socialist organisation
&#8211; as Tommy Sheridan had shown so emphatically when he was the sole
member between 1999 and 2003. With six members in the parliament the
party became entitled to a number of full-time research and case
workers, and the commitment to the MSPs remitting half their
parliamentary salary to the party added to the party&#8217;s resources.
But it also reinforced the party&#8217;s bureaucratic character, and
focused its attention on a parliamentary role which could not but be
limited and constrained.</p>

<p>The rhetoric, of course, endlessly reasserted the party&#8217;s
commitment to the working class and the purity of its socialist
credentials. But it was a serious misrepresentation if this was
intended to indicate a concentration on issues in the trade union
movement, for example, or a commitment to building the resistance in
working class areas around issues like health or housing. Trade union
work was limited in reality to seeking relationships with leading
trade union officials with a view to affiliation. The Socialist
Worker Platform has always argued that we should build links with and
between the rank and file; this was questioned time and again because
it threatened an often asserted but rarely visible sympathetic
relationship with union officials. When the party did move on trade
union questions, it was invariably at the last moment, generally
tokenistic, and often sectarian in the tone of its interventions.</p>

<p>One consequence of what we regard as a squandered opportunity was
that party membership began to decline, as did sales of the party&#8217;s
newspaper <strong>Scottish Socialist Voice</strong>. The paper itself was weak
and inward looking and very consciously controlled by the executive
committee majority faction. While occasional articles were printed
from other positions within the party, they were few and did not
reflect any opening of the paper to debate &#8211; still less any attempt
to make it reflect the wider movement that had carried six comrades
into the parliament. The internal atmosphere grew increasingly
fractious, and criticisms of Sheridan from a supposedly feminist
perspective became increasingly vocal at executive meetings.This was
the background to the events of the executive committee meeting
November 9th 2004 which forced Sheridan&#8217;s resignation.</p>

<p>But it was the G8 meeting at Gleneagles in Scotland in July 2005
which would provide the proof of the two perspectives that were in a
bitter but undeclared conflict within the SSP. In January 2005, at
the regular executive meeting, Socialist Worker Platform members
called for a discussion of our preparations for G8. At that meeting
and at every subsequent one the SSP&#8217;s leadership refused to address
the question. The people who would attend the <em>Make Poverty History</em>
demonstration, it was argued, were middle class liberals; working
class people were not interested in such issues, any more than they
were concerned with the war in Iraq. Workers were interested only in
&#8216;bread and butter questions&#8217;.</p>

<p>In the meantime Socialist Worker Platform members within the SSP
together with a broad range of other groups and organisations had
taken the initiative in setting up a committee to prepare for the
Gleneagles protest on the first day of the G8, and the organisation
of a counter-conference in Edinburgh on the previous Sunday. The
meetings were regular, large and enthusiastic as well as very broad
in character. One MSP, Frances Curran, was assigned to link up with
that organising group, together with a platform member who had been
deeply involved from the outset. The role of the SSP leadership in
that activity was a disgrace: time and again their interventions were
simply designed to block or spoil what was a broad and democratic
initiative, while offering no real practical or political support to
the organisers. Refusing to contribute to the Alternative Summit,
beyond accepting the opportunity to speak on its platforms, those
comrades stuck to the tried and well-worn formula that this was not
of interest to workers and the abstention continued. On the Friday
before the demonstration four of the six MSPs staged an absurd and
pointless stunt in the parliament to veil their ineffectiveness and
distance from the movement. The cost was £30,000 in fines and other
expenses and the general scorn of the public.</p>

<p>As we expected, the <em>Make Poverty History</em> demonstration was
enormous (around 300,000) and as varied, diverse and dynamic as such
demonstrations always are. The SSP leadership&#8217;s main concern,
however, was not how party members could best connect with this new
movement but rather how we could differentiate ourselves from other
marchers. Thus SSP members wore red T-shirts (not white, like
everyone else) and organised a tight, closed contingent rather than
participating throughout the march in the delegations of trade
unionists, students, anti-capitalist protesters and the like.</p>

<p>The Sunday Alternatives Summit was an extraordinary success, with
5,000 people attending a vibrant, open and exciting event full of
political ideas and debate. It was sad, then, to see the SSP
leadership standing outside the main hall throughout the day
collecting signatures for a petition to defend the MSPs who had been
expelled from the parliament. Most significantly, Frances Curran
speaking at the final rally went to considerable pains to emphasise
the differences between the SSP and the movement, and the distance
separating the SSP from the major international figures with whom she
was sharing a platform, including Trevor Ngwane from South Africa,
Susan George, Caroline Lucas and George Galloway.</p>

<p>Several members of the executive committee complained bitterly in
the subsequent meeting about the conduct of the SSP at this great
event, with a supporter of the leadership group publishing a frank
and withering assessment of the party&#8217;s performance in the next
issue of <strong>Frontline</strong>, the magazine of the leadership&#8217;s ISM
platform within the SSP. As a party, the SSP had deliberately and
explicitly refused to engage with the movement, though the Socialist
Worker Platform together with other rank and file members of the SSP,
as well as many others outside the party, had worked tirelessly for
months to build the event.</p>

<p>It might have been asserted, of course, that this was a political
error and lessons could be drawn from it. Instead it was argued in
the immediate aftermath that this was an event somehow &#8216;staged&#8217;
by the SWP. What was not addressed was the paradox that, at a time of
intense political debate among growing numbers of working class
people, not only had the SSP abstained as an organisation, but its
numbers were continuing to decline, as were the sales of its paper,
in what was an extraordinarily favourable atmosphere.</p>

<p>Two months after these massive events, the policy coordinator of
the party, Alan McCombes, presented a paper to the executive
committee which argued that the party&#8217;s main audience lay not in
those who were disaffected by New Labour or those involved in the
anti-war or anti-capitalist movement but rather in the poor and
dispossessed in the housing schemes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The biggest potential reservoir of support for the SSP is
not to be found among Labour voters, SNP voters, Lib Dem voters or
even Green Party voters, but among the 50 percent of the population
who do not participate in elections. Well over 1 million people did
not bother to vote in the 2003 Scottish election or in the 2005
general election.</p>

<p class="fst">Of course the poor and dispossessed must be part of the SSP&#8217;s
potential audience and it is right that a socialist party should be
trying to encourage their entry into political life, while
recognising the difficulties involved in doing so. McCombes&#8217;s
mistake, however, is to imagine that the dispossessed can be the main
or leading component in our social base (one reason, along with his
suggestion that party organisation in future be based on a series of
interest groups or &#8216;networks&#8217; rather than geographical branches,
that his paper was not supported by the executive committee).<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>2: The parting of the ways</h4>

<p class="fst">If much of the leadership seemed unaffected by the events at
Gleneagles, the same cannot be said of the membership of the SSP. The
national conference of the SSP in March of this year (2006) was
notable for its changed atmosphere. Around issues of war, racism and
climate change, delegates consistently rejected sectarian motions
which argued for an &#8216;ourselves alone&#8217; approach, in favour of
working with other activist and campaigners. When Rosie Kane MSP, for
example, spoke in a debate on environmental issues (she is, it should
be remembered, the party&#8217;s most prominent environmental
spokesperson) on behalf of the executive committee, she specifically
rejected the motion that the party should become involved in the
broad Campaign Against Climate Change, arguing instead that &#8216;we
don&#8217;t need to work with anyone else &#8211; we can do it by ourselves&#8217;.
Her position was decisively rejected by the delegates.</p>

<p>The conference delegations included a number of new people who had
come towards the SSP through the work around G8 and anti-war
activities &#8211; the very activities that had been repeatedly rejected
as irrelevant and marginal by the leadership of the organisation. It
was largely through contact with members of the Socialist Worker
Platform that they had joined the SSP; they were mostly young and
non-sectarian. But they saw little of their spirit reflected in the
party&#8217;s paper or in the branch meetings. Indeed what they had
entered felt like a party in decline, controlled by a bureaucratic
layer which saw growth through the movement as a &#8216;dilution&#8217;.</p>

<p>The spirit of the conference made no impact on the executive
committee. The reality was that our support in the country was ebbing
away &#8211; a series of local and parliamentary by-elections in 2006 had
shown how slender that support now was, slipping in some cases below
2 percent of the votes cast. The process of preparing for the
Scottish elections in May 2007 should already have begun, with
candidates being selected and campaigns begun at a local level.
Instead the party leadership remained totally absorbed in the
continuing question of Tommy Sheridan&#8217;s libel action, and
intensified its factional activity, continuing the arguments which
had first surfaced nearly two years earlier. Sheridan had been
elected chair of the party by conference. But the party&#8217;s
leadership was not prepared to accept the declared will of the party.
Instead it counter-attacked, launching yet another whispering
campaign intended to force Sheridan to drop the case, and effectively
withdrawing the political support of the party from him at a critical moment.</p>

<p>There is a clear pattern of behaviour on the part of the SSP
leadership throughout the last three years, whose roots lie still
further back in the SSP&#8217;s history. When put to the test, on every
occasion those in control of the party have shown that the declared
intention to move towards a new kind of open, mass-based political
formation was worth little more than the paper it was written on. The
existing membership of the party, declining day by day, neither
controlled nor understood what was happening at the top. The
prevailing method remained sectarian in relation to the class and
bureaucratic in relation to the membership. Far from engaging with
and winning the leadership of the movement in Scotland, the SSP stood
back from the movement, refused to work to win the leadership of it,
and more often than not condemned it for its political limitations.</p>

<p>Sheridan himself was a member of the ISM platform; those who
turned against him were almost all his close political allies until
very recently. They have now turned against him for reasons that are
far more profoundly political than personal. While Sheridan shares
his political roots with the SSP leadership, he has had a major
influence in winning support for the party in the class with his
consistent record of political activism around war, asylum seekers
and anti-capitalism. In 2003 his name was on the ballot paper beside
the party logo. The project for which people voted was inescapably
associated in the public mind with Tommy Sheridan. That is why the
majority of party members represented at a party national council in
June gave their full support to Sheridan and rejected the convoluted
arguments presented by the executive committee majority to justify
what was seen as a public betrayal of a leading socialist and the
project he represented.</p>

<p>One argument offered by the leadership was that the principal
issue was gender rather than class. Sheridan himself has suggested
that the conflict is between what he characterises as &#8216;gender
politics&#8217; and &#8216;class politics&#8217;. This is not necessarily a
characterisation that we would accept, not least since we see the
struggle against class exploitation and for women&#8217;s liberation as
intimately linked. Nevertheless, the dominance of feminist ideas
among a section of the party has led them to see the central issue as
being Sheridan&#8217;s alleged personal behaviour rather than News
International&#8217;s attacks on a leading socialist.</p>

<p>The SWP was able to clarify its understanding of the real Marxist
tradition on women&#8217;s liberation through a lengthy and sometimes
bitter faction fight in the early 1980s around the question of
&#8216;autonomous&#8217; women&#8217;s organisation. By contrast no such debate
took place within Militant, which was in fact notorious on the left
in the 1970s and 1980s for its denunciation of the women&#8217;s
liberation movement as &#8216;petty bourgeois&#8217;. Perhaps as a
consequence of that experience, leading SSP members who are former
<strong>Militant</strong> supporters have now &#8216;flip-flopped&#8217; into an
uncritical acceptance of many feminist ideas. As an example of where
such positions can lead, in an article in the <strong>Sunday Herald</strong>
MSP Carolyn Leckie (who was not previously in Militant) claimed that
the SSP took the nursery nurses&#8217; dispute less seriously than other
disputes because it involved women workers. This was an outrageous
slander against the many SSP comrades, male and female, who visited
picket lines on a daily basis but is particularly inaccurate in that
an important source of support for Sheridan comes from nursery nurses
who joined the party because of his support for their strike!</p>

<p>For the majority of party members it was clear that the court case
would never have gone ahead had some executive committee members not
attempted to use the case to oust Sheridan from his leadership role.
The reasons were always political &#8211; at root, a conflict between two
different visions of the party. Tommy Sheridan did not argue the case
for a wider involvement in the movement against his own colleagues,
and until relatively recently he did not openly criticise the
intensifying sectarianism within the party. Yet for significant
numbers of party members, and many more outside the party, because of
his consistent activity and his public association with the anti-war
campaign at several levels he has come to represent the kind of
broad, activist party the SSP should have become.</p>

<p>The decision by party members at a further delegate meeting was
that a national conference of the SSP should be held as soon as
possible after the ending of the libel case. Motions proposed for
that meeting made it very clear that the purpose of that conference
would be to force out the old leadership and elect a new and
different one. We in the Socialist Worker Platform began to prepare
actively for what could have been an important opportunity to change
the direction of the party.</p>

<p>In the weeks that followed, however, it became obvious to us all
that those controlling the SSP would never allow the change to
happen. The campaign of vilification was conducted through the press
and the media; so poisonous was it that a number of normally
unsympathetic commentators began to offer support to Sheridan. Party
members opposed to the present leadership were sent anonymous notes
in their party mailing, while others were physically assaulted during
branch meetings. It was a clear indication that the sectarian faction
still controlling the party would destroy it rather than release
their control.</p>

<p>There was still a clear majority of SSP members committed to the
project that had brought us together five years ago; our loyalty was
to that project, and not to a party which now offered only a
sectarian model isolated from the movements and buried in
abstraction, a party which continued its slanders against Tommy
Sheridan throughout the period when Lebanon was being destroyed by
Israeli arms. This was not a minor dispute but a fundamental parting
of the ways.</p>

<p>We hope that those forces committed to building a mass-based
socialist alternative to New Labour, an anti-capitalist formation
open to all those opposed to global capital and war, can now work
together to build the newly formed Solidarity organisation. This was
the basis of the decision of the members of the Socialist Worker
Platform to throw our weight and our commitment behind this new organisation:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Socialist Worker Platform recognises with some
sadness that the SSP is no longer the broad and open mass party of
the left we committed ourselves to building when we joined it some
five years ago. While the imperialist war intensifies and spreads
into Lebanon, and the level of public anger and opposition grows, the
SSP has proved unable to respond to that anger or provide any
direction for it.</p>

<p class="quote">The potential for building a broad and inclusive
organisation of the Scottish left is as great as ever. It is the duty
of socialists to respond to and build on that potential. We welcome
the initiative of calling an open public meeting of the Scottish left
on 3 September in Glasgow to launch Solidarity and will actively work
to build it, in the belief that it could represent the first stage in
building a new political formation that can answer the needs of the
many socialists and activists in Scotland, a launching pad for a new
Scottish left that will be open, democratic, internationalist and
committed to the building of a new and better world.</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#f1" name="n1">1.</a> The overwhelming majority of the EC had been members of the
Militant Tendency. Three were members of the Socialist Worker
platform, including myself. The one member of our platform present at
the meeting in November 2004 voted for the decision calling on
Sheridan to resign but immediately and publicly acknowledged that she
had been wrong.</p>
