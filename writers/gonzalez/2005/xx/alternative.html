<p class="fst">It had been a very hot summer in Porto Alegre. The grass was
scorched all along the riverbank site where the 2005 World Social
Forum was held. Only the converted gas plant which served as a
communications centre offered any kind of shade. Unlike previous
years, the meeting was divided by areas &#8211; environmental, indigenous
struggles, social movements, culture, and so on &#8211; each with their
own complex of different sized marquees to accommodate the meetings
and debates.</p>

<p>Walking along through the ranks of tents and past the 2,500 or so
talks, you could pick up snatches of the discussions going on inside
&#8211; though it was over an hour&#8217;s march from one end to the other.
There were heated conversations about every aspect of the movement &#8211;
global warming, land rights, sustainable development, the role of
trade unions, the future of social movements, the political strategy
to follow. It was as if you were listening to the soundtrack of a
new, living movement.</p>

<p>The 155,000 gathered in Porto Alegre were the delegates and
representatives of a huge and growing movement, multiple in language
and background, wide and diverse in its range of concerns. It was
extraordinary to think that it had not existed six years earlier &#8211;
that this movement emerged in Seattle, weathered the post-9/11 demand
that we declare ourselves for civilisation against the terrorists,
and embraced the anti-war impulse without losing sight of the enemy.
Far from being diverted from the critique of capitalism as a system,
as some leading intellectuals had feared, a predominantly young
mobilisation now rediscovered imperialism, its systematic use of
violence in pursuit of economic ends, and linked them in a
deceptively simple slogan &#8211; &#8216;No blood for oil.&#8217;</p>

<p>In January 2003 the third World Social Forum took place just weeks
after the election to the Brazilian presidency of Lula, candidate of
the Workers Party (the PT), which he had led since its creation in
1980. For the 60 percent of Brazil&#8217;s electorate who supported him,
Lula&#8217;s election promised change. The civil servants who had been
fighting for years over their pension rights, the landless workers
whose organisation (the MST) had been involved in bitter struggles
with private gunmen and government forces for nearly two decades, the
poor families who were pressing for a democratised education system,
all had invested their optimism in Lula. And it was optimism
encouraged by many sections of the left, including one Trotskyist
tendency, the DS, which joined his government &#8211; and remains there.</p>

<p>Yet when Lula visited the forum in 2003, and was rapturously
received, he was already on his way to the World Economic Forum at
Davos, where he would be photographed shaking hands with the
luminaries of the world financial system. The World Social Forum
began two years before precisely as an alternative, a counterweight
to the meetings of the bankers whose decisions would directly affect
the vast majority of the peoples of the world while giving them no
access or involvement in reaching those decisions. So it was
particularly ironic that Lula should go straight from Porto Alegre to Davos.</p>

<p>The WSF, after all, was not intended as a lobbying group but as an
alternative, a place where the strategies of resistance against the
programmes and projects of the WTO, the World Bank and the IMF could
be discussed and coordinated. It was already obvious, however, that
Lula was bent on renegotiating the terms of Brazil&#8217;s engagement
with the world economy, not on challenging or rejecting them. His
first tests came early in 2003, with the confrontation with the civil
service unions, new land occupations and the nomination of
representatives of capital to key posts like the head of the national
bank and the ministry of agriculture. Three PT deputies and a senator
opposed to the government&#8217;s pensions and tax policies were first
disciplined and later expelled from the party.</p>

<p>Meeting two years later (the intervening WSF took place in January
2004 in Mumbai, India) the promise and the disillusionment could not
help but shape the atmosphere and political direction of the forum.
Lula&#8217;s presence caused friction, anger and frustration. There was
no sign of the euphoria of two years earlier, despite the attempts by
the PT to recreate it at Lula&#8217;s rally in the Gigantinho sports
stadium on the first day. But it was a staged affair: the seats had
been packed early with party loyalists, though there were a small
number of critics who shouted from the benches. A demonstration
outside by a number of left groups accused Lula of betrayal.</p>

<p>But in a sense the evidence of a wider disaffection was provided
by the PT&#8217;s recent loss of power in the city. And this was Porto
Alegre, the symbol of a new kind of political arrangement embodied in
the &#8216;participatory budgets&#8217;. Some of the key figures in the WSF
organising committee, people like Hilary Wainwright, had written
passionately about the Porto Alegre experiment. It seemed to fit well
into the framework of arguments about taking power without
necessarily seizing the state.</p>

<p>In fact it was always open to serious question, as the popular
assemblies could only discuss the allocation of a small proportion of
the municipal budget, let alone address the overall priorities of the
distribution of wealth on a national scale.</p>

<p>In any event, the loss of Porto Alegre was an enormous blow, and
no amount of grandstanding could conceal that from a radical
Brazilian audience. But the reality was that the implications of
Lula&#8217;s defeat set the whole political agenda. The national rally of
PSOL (the Socialism and Freedom Party founded by the deputies
expelled from the PT and others) drew some 1,800 mainly young people
and announced the creation of a political space of great potential
significance. On a wider panorama, the Lula experience called into
question the very positive spin that sections of the movement had
placed on the group of new Latin American presidents &#8211; Guti&#233;rrez
in Ecuador, Kirchner in Argentina, Parra in Paraguay, Ch&#225;vez in
Venezuela (and the recently elected president of Uruguay, Tabar&#233;
V&#225;zquez). Kirchner still enjoyed some degree of popular credibility
because he had moved against the perpetrators of the human rights
abuses under previous military government and seemed to be acting
with some independence in the face of international capital.
Guti&#233;rrez, on the other hand, had compromised and abandoned his
commitments to the mass movement that carried him to power.</p>

<p>Just before the conference the death was announced of the
venerable Brazilian economist Celso Furtado, the main architect of a
theory of dependency and its attendant strategies of independent
national economic development. Months before his death he had broken
with Lula &#8211; and the new president did not attend his funeral. The
symbolism was inescapable. The promise of a solution based on a
single nation-state taking on a global capitalist system had
foundered in Brazil as it had in Ecuador and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Yet the forum had always had at its heart a strong current of
reformism led by ATTAC, the coalition opposed to international
finance whose strongest section was in France, and the majority of
NGOs. For them the focus was always on a moral case which could
persuade social democratic governments to acknowledge a
responsibility to aid and debt relief programmes. Blair and Brown&#8217;s
much-vaunted Africa initiatives, for example, seemed to encourage
that kind of approach. On the other hand the recent failure of most
of the governments of the wealthy nations to deliver aid in any
quantities to the victims of the tsunami called that perspective into
question. And recent Latin American experience, with Lula at its
heart, did not augur well for any serious challenge to global capital
and its priorities &#8211; despite the defiance displayed at the WTO
conference in Cancun last year.</p>

<p>Against this background, strategic questions were again on the
unwritten but acknowledged agenda of many of those present at Porto Alegre.</p>

<p>It had always been a rule of the social forums that political
organisations should not take part directly. The rationale was that
the problems should be addressed in terms of practical solutions and
in a wide-ranging debate. The rule was always honoured in the breach
&#8211; but it did have the advantage of limiting the intervention of
political parties with little or no involvement in the movement. In
some ways, the physical organisation of the forum &#8211; this year in
particular &#8211; encouraged the view of its work as a series of
parallel and specific debates, with strategic thinking informed by
&#8216;regional&#8217; considerations alone. This year, as opposed to all
previous years (and very particularly to Mumbai), there was no
central event or space which could bring together all the components
and create a sense of the whole movement &#8211; with all its tensions
and contradictory pressures.</p>

<p>This undoubtedly did present a problem at this key conjuncture.
Faced with the failure of the Lula alternative, the central question
for all of us was how to develop a central and united strategy to
confront the highly centralised and coordinated project of global
capital. In 2003 the decision to back the worldwide protest against
the Iraq war on 15 February brought 20 million people into activity
worldwide and vindicated our common purpose. This year, while the
Assembly of Social Movements did emerge ultimately with a clear
anti-war position and a call for global action on 19 March, it was
harder to achieve than two years earlier, precisely because there was
an emphasis on diversity and fragmentation rather than unity of action.</p>

<p>Yet at the same time there was clearly a counter-impulse within
the forum. If fragmentation encouraged a lobbying view of the
political role of the forums (world, regional, social) there was a
different, although not fully formed, political understanding present
as well. The questions that were being debated showed the openness of
many delegates to discussions about socialism, alternative ways of
organising society and explorations of how a different world might
look and feel.</p>

<p>And in some ways the alternative was summarised &#8211; in a rather
contradictory way &#8211; by the reception given to Hugo Ch&#225;vez. He
appeared at the end of the forum &#8211; in effect his visit to the
Gigantinho stadium was the closing act of the forum. And it was clear
that the reception he was given was spontaneous and authentic &#8211;
unlike Lula&#8217;s in the same place a few days earlier. For three and a
half hours he addressed a crowd inside the arena, and outside it,
with the kind of populist rhetoric he is so good at. He spoke with
real instinct to the audience he had before him, insisting on his
anti- imperialism, arguing for the arming of the people and for the
first time ever describing his political objective as a socialist revolution.</p>

<p>Ch&#225;vez symbolised a more radical alternative with its emphasis on
organisation from below, on popular power and on a vision of a
socialist future. And in that sense, he spoke for and to the
anxieties and concerns of the majority of the delegates to the forum,
particularly the young, for whom the issue now was a way forward
moving from protest and resistance towards a purposive struggle.</p>

<p>The problem, of course, was that what Ch&#225;vez said at Porto Alegre
was not at all the same thing as what his government is doing. Within
Venezuela, the movement for change is also facing a crossroads. It is
the upsurge from below that has saved Ch&#225;vez three times in the last
three years from the attempts by the right to overthrow him. But on
each occasion he had pulled back from the demands of the movement,
seeking compromise with the US and even with sections of the
bourgeoisie. The government itself includes people who are bitterly
hostile to the project of popular power and democracy from below to
which Ch&#225;vez committed himself in Porto Alegre.</p>

<p>Thus, while Ch&#225;vez could symbolise the alternative the movement
was seeking, he could not claim to be implementing it. If there was a
model of a different kind of power, it came not from Venezuela but
from Bolivia, where a mass popular movement had twice defeated
capitalist economic strategies imposed by the international financial
agencies.</p>

<p>For the left, the challenge of Porto Alegre and the period to come
is twofold: to build the movement in all its breadth and diversity,
as activists and organisers on the one hand, and to raise within that
movement the larger political questions on which the revolutionary
socialist tradition can offer a body of understanding, experience and
ideas. But in fulfilling that double task, there are habits that have
to be abandoned &#8211; habits of sectarianism and isolation, of a
refusal (or perhaps an inability) to engage with those sections of
workers, for example, whose daily resistance will bring them into a
closer engagement with those ideas &#8211; but whose starting point may
well be distant from that of the left.</p>

<p>The successful experiences of recent times, the anti-war movement,
for example, have built a united front around shared objectives; that
has then become the space in which the politics of revolutionary
transformation, whose starting point is exactly that self-activity of
the class, can begin to take root and make sense. The openness of
PSOL&#8217;s first congress was an encouraging sign of the possibilities
to come. For if the World Social Forum has taught us anything it is
that in the absence of revolutionary ideas as a living force within
the movement other ideas will fill the void, ideas which cannot offer
the prospect of a socialist democracy or a transfer of power out of
the hands of that minority that today seems so ready to place the
future of the planet in jeopardy.</p>
