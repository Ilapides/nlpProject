<p class="fst"><strong>6 June 2005:</strong> Bolivian president Carlos Mesa submits his
resignation in an attempt to end weeks of crippling protests
demanding nationalisation of the country&#8217;s natural gas reserves.</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>7 June:</strong> Mass demonstrations continue to paralyse La Paz,
cut it off from the rest of the country and surround the Congress.</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>8 June:</strong> Meeting in El Alto, heartland of the great
rebellion, the Popular Assembly of the First Nations forms a People&#8217;s
General Staff on which all the mass organisations are represented
(though in the end not all of them attend). La Paz daily <strong>La Razon</strong>
editorialises, &#8216;[The situation is] a profound crisis for Bolivia
... [Mesa] could have been a great president, but luck had it that
the necessary political conditions were against him, and it fell to
him to have to face a ferocious and irrational ideological
onslaught.&#8217; Santa Cruz&#8217;s <strong>El Deber</strong> writes of &#8216;one of the
worst crises in Bolivia&#8217;s republican history&#8217;.</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>9 June, morning:</strong> Congress moves to Sucre in an attempt to
avoid demonstrations in the capital. There are moves to give the
presidency to a hard right-wing figure, Vaca Diez, who would try to
impose military rule. The Congress building is surrounded by members
of the mass organisations. The major highways are blocked for the
third day running &#8211; 119 today. The Santa Cruz gas fields are taken
over by their workers. Pipeline valves are shut down in Cochabamba
and La Paz. Airline workers shut down all the country&#8217;s airports.
In El Alto, the Popular Assembly issues a six-point declaration that
begins by declaring that El Alto is now &#8216;the general headquarters
of the Bolivian Revolution of the 21st century&#8217;. It announces the
formation of a unified leadership. Its central demand is the
nationalisation of hydrocarbons(oil and natural gas). It agrees to
form people&#8217;s assemblies in every department,and rejects electoral
solutions and constitutional successions.</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>9 June, evening:</strong> Evo Morales, leader of MAS, the biggest
left party in Congress, agrees to a compromise formula, with the
presidency going tothe head of the Supreme Court, Eduardo Rodriguez,
until an election towards the end of the year. Strikes end,
roadblocks are lifted and the protests come to an end. Oscar Olivera,
leader of protests in Cochabamba, declares:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In this mobilisation we have seen two things. On one hand
we, the various social movements, are capable of paralysing the
entire country, and of counteringthe manoeuvres of the businessmen
and bad politicians. On the other hand, we have not been capable of
imposing our own decisions and objectives ... Based on these two
considerations, we have opened a wide debate in all the
neighbourhoods and communities of Cochabamba and the country about
the need to build, little by little, our own capacity for
self-government, to push for that in the next mobilisation. Our
immense strength should correspond to a great and creative capacity
to carry out our own decisions beyond the official institutions and
traditional political parties, which always drive us to the edge of
the precipice. On this occasion, this has begun to happen with the
occupation of hydrocarbon wells, gas plants and refineries, and on
the next occasion we must be capable of operating them ourselves for
our own good. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Three Bolivias</h4>

<p class="fst">It is often said that Bolivia is not a single country but three,
linked by historical circumstance and colonial convenience. The
differences between them are economic and political, but they are
also ethnic and historical. The altiplano, the heart of Bolivia&#8217;s
ancient Aymara culture, was and remains primarily indigenous &#8211; it
was the native Bolivians who were driven into the mines to work them,
or who sustained the high altitude agriculture sometimes only made
bearable by the coca leaf. It is also the site of Bolivia&#8217;s major
cities &#8211; La Paz, Potos&#237;, Sucre, and the newest city of them all,
El Alto, 1,000 feet above La Paz, and home to over a million
indigenous people. Cochabamba, in the lower valleys, was more
hospitable but distant culturally and geographically from the world
of the high Andes. Santa Cruz, to the east, was inaccessible from the
mountains until very recently, when the twin commodities of oil and
coca forced the region open to the wider world.</p>

<p>Since 1999 all three have become elements in a social
confrontation that has placed in doubt the relentless campaign of
global capital to absorb and control Latin America, along with the
rest of the world. The traditions of workers&#8217; organisation and
indigenous resistance in the high Andes have combined in a struggle
that has expanded into the valleys around Cochabamba and the streets
of El Alto before erupting into the streets of Bolivia&#8217;s capital,
La Paz. The demand was for control of the key resources of the
country &#8211; first water, and more recently oil and gas. The
landowners and entrepreneurs of Santa Cruz, the private beneficiaries
of that wealth, have threatened to declare themselves independent
from the rest of the country, and to keep the income from oil, gas
and coca for themselves.</p>

<p>Bolivia is the region&#8217;s poorest country after Haiti. Yet
throughout history it has produced enormous riches for a very few.
The altiplano, the high plateau of the Andes, was for centuries the
source of Bolivia&#8217;s extraordinary wealth. In the mid-16th century
the city of Potos&#237; was larger than London was at the time, and
produced some two thirds of the world&#8217;s silver. Three centuries
later tin hacked from great volcanic slabs buried deep in the
mountains made fortunes for a tiny group of local and foreign mine-owners.</p>

<p>The region around the city of Cochabamba is a fertile plain. Its
climate is temperate and spring-like, and its markets full of the
colourful products of local agriculture. Big landowners and small
farmers share the region. But for small producers especially, water
has always played a key role. Despite appearances, the area suffers
from a chronic shortage of water exacerbated by the growth of urban
areas, especially the city of Cochabamba itself, and a rising graph
of water consumption.</p>

<p>Santa Cruz, in the eastern lowlands, is an area of open plains
fringed by rainforest. During the first half of the 20th century it
was sparsely populated and controlled by landlords who owned vast
expanses of land. It was also the scene of perhaps the most brutal
episode of Bolivian history &#8211; a three-year war with Paraguay
(1932&#8211;35) in the Chaco region for control of the region&#8217;s oil
reserves. In the mid-1950s, however, agriculture expanded &#8211; mainly
cotton, sugar and cattle &#8211; and foreign corporations like Gulf began
to drill for oil and gas. In the 1970s and 1980s more and more land
was given over to the cultivation of coca, from which cocaine is
manufactured, as the drugs trade proved to be by far the most
profitable.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The neo-liberal assault</h4>

<p class="fst">On 6 June 2005, for the second time in two years, a mass movement
brought down a government. President Carlos Mesa finally yielded to
the pressure of the community organisations, anti-gas campaigns,
trade unions and indigenous groups, and resigned. He had failed to
convince the Bolivian masses that his proposed law on the control of
oil and gas production was anything other than an attempt to evade
the clear and insistent demand of all sections of the movement &#8211;
nationalisation of Bolivia&#8217;s hydrocarbons. Mesa should have known
better. Until October 2003 he had been the country&#8217;s
vice-president, with a reputation for independent thought. His
predecessor, Gonzalo S&#225;nchez de Losada (&#8216;Goni&#8217;), however, could
make no such claim.</p>

<p>Losada headed a government dedicated to the objectives set out for
him by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The
discovery of huge reserves of natural gas, calculated in 2001 at 47
trillion cubic feet, placed Bolivia second only to Venezuela in the
level of its reserves. This appeared to provide an opportunity for
the Bolivian state to generate considerable income, as well as
respond to domestic demand for cheap and accessible fuel after years
of impoverishment, and deepening social and economic inequality. But
Losada was a creature of neo-liberalism, his role to hasten Bolivia&#8217;s
integration into the world market. So his response was to enter
negotiations with a consortium of Repsol (the Spanish oil company),
BP-Amoco and British Gas to channel the reserves to the United
States. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p>The idea was to channel a pipeline through Chile, and from there
up the western seaboard to California. Bolivia itself has no access
to the sea, having lost its two major coastal cities to Chile and
Peru in punishing late 19th century wars. It has been suggested that
the first popular reaction to the plan arose out of nationalist
resentments towards Chile, always a topic of the speeches of the
populist right. But this cannot in any way explain the breadth and
intensity of the reaction to Lozada&#8217;s plan &#8211; a plan that would
eventually lead to the death of over 60 demonstrators and Losada&#8217;s
hurried flight to the United States.</p>

<p>His ejection was the most dramatic step thus far in a battle that
had begun four years earlier in Cochabamba.</p>

<p>By then, Bolivia was already 14 years into a strategy of
aggressive integration into the world market &#8211; a policy
euphemistically described as &#8216;structural adjustment&#8217;. In some
ways, Bolivia was to be a model of how the project would be managed
elsewhere in Latin America, for although it was among the poorest
nations in the region, it was also one whose recent history (the 1952
revolution and its aftermath <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a>) had placed the organisations of the
working class at the heart of politics, and had seen at least
apparent attempts to implement nationalisations and agrarian reform.
By the early1980s, however, the economic foundation of working class
organisation &#8211; the mining industry &#8211; was in steep decline, and
the body of producers whose long history of heroic resistance had
written so many chapters of Bolivia&#8217;s history was dispersed and demobilised.</p>

<p>The presidency of Paz Estenssoro set in train a series of measures
which would lead to the privatisation of much of the economy,
including the privatising of education, the result of which was a
dramatic rise in the levels of illiteracy. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> S&#225;nchez de Lozada&#8217;s
first spell as president followed (1993&#8211;97), and he initiated the
so called <em>Plan for All</em> (<em>Plan de Todos</em>) that enabled him
to sell off all Bolivia&#8217;s publicly-owned utility companies &#8211;
electricity, telephones, railways and, most significantly of all, the
Bolivian national oil company YPFB.</p>

<p>This consolidated the end of an economy based on mining, and a
definitive shift towards an economy based, on the one hand, on drugs
and export agriculture, and on the other on the growth of small-scale
industry, especially in and around the capital. Privatisation drew in
the external loans, but it also reflected the increasing integration
of a new Bolivian oligarchy partly based in the expanding economy of
Santa Cruz and the institutions of global capitalism.</p>

<p>As elsewhere in Latin America, neo-liberalism brought windfall
fortunes to those who represented its interests and sold off the
state&#8217;s assets at preferential prices. The economy was sluggish.
Bolivian exports at the beginning of the 1980s were worth $1,300
million &#8211; in 2003 the figure was $1,600 million, a minimal
improvement. Meanwhile the average per capita income in 1980, $940,
rose by only $20 in the same period. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p>Yet Jeffrey Sachs, the ubiquitous guru of neo-liberalism,
described Lozada as one of the most creative politicians of the age.
It was likely that Sachs was moved to such eulogy not only by
Lozada&#8217;s obedience to IMF dictates, but also by the fact that there
was relatively little popular resistance to these measures. There are
several possible explanations for this. Coca cultivation guaranteed a
higher income to small farmers than any other cash crop &#8211; and the
world trade was booming. The traditional organisations of struggle
which stood in the leadership of every struggle in the decades since
1952, the miners&#8217; union and the national trade union federation
(COB) which it dominated, were undermined and disarmed by the
dismantling of the mining industry and the migration of its social
base. The economic crisis of the 1980s had exhausted the Bolivian
working class, and its national profile gave way in those years to
more local and sectoral forms of resistance.</p>

<p>Lozada was succeeded in power by Hugo Banzer, a military oligarch
whose previous presidency (1971&#8211;77) had been marked by widespread
and monumental corruption, and sustained and savage repression. It
was widely known that Banzer and his cabinet were deeply embroiled in
the growing drugs trade of the times, and there was little attempt to
conceal the fact that military aeroplanes regularly transported coca
out of the country. So it was particularly ironic that Banzer&#8217;s
return to power, in 1997, should coincide with the US government&#8217;s
much-vaunted &#8216;war on drugs&#8217;, whose first public manifestations
were directed against the coca growers of the Chapare.</p>

<p>Miners who had migrated after the shutting of the mines did not
lose their collective memory of decades of struggle, and US-backed
attacks on coca cultivation met fierce rejection. Meanwhile in the
communities of highland peasant farmers a different tradition of
struggle developed. A new peasant federation (the CSUTCB) had been
formed in 1978 under the powerful influence of the Tupac Katari
Revolutionary Movement <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> (MRTK) led by Genaro Flores Santos. This
new movement was driven by a conception of Aymara nationalism and
traditions of ethnic resistance very different to those of highland
peasant organisations that had once functioned under the leadership
of the COB, with its traditions of revolutionary workers&#8217;
organisation. Issues of ethnicity prevailed in the battles and
confrontations of the late 1980s and 1990s, although the movement was
far from unified &#8211; indeed, one of the best known Katarista leaders,
Victor Hugo Cardenas, became a vice-president in the first Lozada government.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Cochabamba on the march</h4>

<p class="fst">In 1999 President Banzer announced the sale of Cochabamba&#8217;s
public water enterprise to a new company, Aguas del Tunari, a
subsidiary of the giant US corporation Bechtel:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Privatising Cochabamba&#8217;s water was a major item in the
World Bank&#8217;s June 1999 country report for Bolivia, which
specifically called for &#8216;no public subsidies&#8217; to hold down water
price hikes. In a process with just one bidder, local press reports
calculated that investors put up less than $20,000 of upfront capital
for a water system worth millions. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">There was an explosion of popular rage when it became clear the
immediate result would be a rise in prices. In December 1999 the
Coordinadora del Agua was formed under the leadership of a machinist
in his mid-forties, Oscar Olivera <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a>, after a series of actions
through the previous month in which small farmers blocked highways
into the city.</p>

<p>The demonstrations in Cochabamba began in January, with the demand
for the withdrawal of the price increases. The Coordinadora gathered
its forces for a major demonstration on 4 February paralysing the
city. While popular protests have always characterised Bolivian
history, this was a different and new movement. What was most
impressive about it was that it gathered into a single stream a whole
range of the currents of resistance that had grown up, mainly around
local issues, in the preceding years. Here indigenous and community
organisations marched with market traders, coca farmers (the
<em>cocaleros</em>), organised workers, students and civil servants. On
4 February and subsequent days they took on armed police, and
breathed in the teargas thrown at them.</p>

<p>&#8216;Everyone took a role,&#8217; says Oscar Olivera. &#8216;Youth were on
the frontlines, the elderly made roadblocks.&#8217; When protest leaders
called on the radio for a citywide transportation stoppage in
response to the police downtown crackdown, little old women with bent
spines were out in the streets within minutes, building blockades
with branches and rocks. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p>There was no direct connection with the events that had occurred
three months earlier at Seattle, but it was not inaccurate to
describe the atmosphere in Cochabamba as redolent of the &#8216;spirit of
Seattle&#8217;. At opposite ends of the hemisphere the strategies of
neo-liberalism, and the multinational corporations that were its
instruments and beneficiaries, were meeting a new kind of unified resistance.</p>

<p>And it won. Within seven days the Banzer government withdrew the
contract from Bechtel and introduced a new system for the
distribution of water, controlled by the mayor and a committee of
elected representatives. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p>The Cochabamba action was in every sense a triumph. It was also a
detonator. Protests proliferated across the country. In La Paz a
militant police strike erupted over levels of taxation, rural
communities resisted a new law that removed local control of water,
and the state of the roads brought other communities out onto the
highways with their own barricades. In El Alto, water privatisation
also brought the largely indigenous population of the city into
direct confrontation with another multinational water company, Suez.</p>

<p>Cochabamba was the turning point at which mass struggle at the
grassroots became a determinant in resisting neo-liberalism. It
provided anew model of struggle. It was not a matter of the
combativity of those who took to the streets &#8211; the whole history of
the country is peppered with examples of heroism and determination in
the face of the forces of the state. Rather it was the unity and
coordination of different organisations that marked a new stage, as
well as its increasing politicisation. The demonstrators, like the
anti-capitalist protesters after Seattle, found that every local
issue brought them rapidly face to face with the global strategies of
capital. Equally significant was the fact that it was a
politicisation that took place largely outside the framework of
existing political organisations, even those of the left, and the
discredited formal structures of the political system. It was a
radicalisation whose rhetoric and references addressed several
different traditions at once &#8211; the history of working class
struggle, the historic experience of the left, the complexities of
community organisation, and also the strength of a resurgent
indigenous nationalism.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Looking to the past: the Bolivian revolution</h4>

<p class="fst">For many of those involved in activities today, a key point of
identifications the revolution of 1952. Its lessons do not apply in a
direct way to the contemporary situation, because in some ways the
continuity of Bolivia&#8217;s political history was broken in the 1980s.
But memories are not easily wiped clean, nor the victories of the
past, as well as the defeats, so easily forgotten. And for the left,
struggling to link the most advanced experiences of class struggle to
the debates emerging in the current phase, 1952 is a point of
departure on many levels.</p>

<p>While it is probably the least known of Latin America&#8217;s
revolutionary moments, the events of 1952 are in some ways closest to
the pattern held dear by the revolutionary socialist tradition and
captured in that most central of defining phrases that the revolution
shall be the &#8216;self-emancipation of the working class&#8217;. Its
central actor was the most advanced section of the working class, at
the heart of a revolutionary national union. It imposed state control
over Bolivia&#8217;s most important national resource &#8211; tin. And at the
moment of revolution, organs of direct democracy and workers&#8217;
control emerged in the context of an armed people. Yet its outcome &#8211;
the progress from the overthrow of an old regime to the creation of a
new workers&#8217; state &#8211; was not that envisaged by those who led the
movement, and heroic though the revolution was, it must figure among
the list of defeats suffered by the workers&#8217; movement. Though that
should not diminish its importance as a rehearsal of workers&#8217; power.</p>

<p>Bolivia in 1952 was even more deeply submerged in poverty than it
is today: 72 percent of its population were involved in agriculture
on 2 percent of the land. Just over 3 percent of the people worked in
mining, which represented 25 percent of GDP. The main product of the
mines was tin, 80 percent of it owned at that time by three powerful
individual Bolivian families &#8211; their exports amounted to nearly 20
percent of the world&#8217;s tin production. At a time of rearmament and
war, tin was a hugely profitable commodity, especially given the
inhuman conditions under which its miners lived and worked. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> By
the early 1940s the richest of the three, Simon Pati&#241;o, boasted a
personal fortune of $70 million, placing him among the six richest
people on earth. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a> Like his fellow tin barons (known collectively
as La Rosca), Patino reinvested in Europe and the US. Bolivia derived
precious little from its metal.</p>

<p>At this time the mining workforce numbered 53,000, and already had
behind it a history of bitter and brutal struggle. When the miners
formed their first national union in 1944, at a meeting at Pati&#241;o&#8217;s
Huanunimine, it was at the initiative of the MNR (Revolutionary
National Movement). Formed in 1940, the MNR was a nationalist
coalition with an anti-imperialist perspective and a populist
rhetoric. In 1942, when striking miners and their families were
gunned down during a strike, the MNR launched a campaign of support
for the workers and publicly attacked the government and the Rosca.
At the same time, however, they were working with a small group of
nationalist officers &#8211; one of whom, Gualberto Villarroel, came to
power in a coup in December 1943. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p>Within the working class the dominant organisation was the
Stalinist PIR (Party of the Revolutionary Left), which was hopelessly
compromised by a policy of support for the government on the grounds
that the priority was support for the Allies in the Second World War.
For Bolivia, that support meant maintaining a low price for tin and
discouraging miners from fighting to raise the price of their labour.
Thus they opposed a Villarroel government which supported workers and
trade union rights. Thus in the two years he was in power, trade
union membership and militancy grew &#8211; and it was the MNR,
represented by the general secretary of the miners, Juan Lech&#237;n
Oquendo, that filled the ideological vacuum left by the PIR. In the
more militant unions, however, the Trotskyist POR (Workers
Revolutionary Party), led by Guillermo Lora, was also gaining a
significant influence. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p>The MNR joined the government in 1944. Its future presidential
candidate V&#237;ctor Paz Estenssoro became finance minister, and his
highly orthodox economic policies directly attacked working class
demands. Striking workers were attacked and the regime became
increasingly repressive &#8211; yet Paz remained a minister. Support for
the MNR among workers rapidly waned. An emergency conference of the
miners&#8217; union in March 1946 broke definitively with Villarroel and
adopted a programme of demands drawn up by Lora and the POR &#8211; the
<em>Pulacayo Theses</em>. James Dunkerley describes the theses as
&#8216;essentially an application of Trotsky&#8217;s 1938 <strong>Transitional
Programme</strong> to Bolivian conditions&#8217;. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a> They argued that
Bolivia was a backward capitalist country in which the proletariat,
as the leading revolutionary class, should seek alliances with the
peasantry, artisans and petty bourgeoisie, but warned against the
incorporation of workers&#8217; ministers into bourgeois governments. It
set out a series of tactical demands including a sliding scale of
wages, nationalisation of the mines and the creation of a national
trade union confederation.</p>

<p>The <em>Theses</em> won considerable support &#8211; a reflection of the
respect that members of the POR enjoyed within the working class
movement. But this is not the same thing as asserting that the
majority of militant miners had been won to a revolutionary
perspective, nor that the POR in fact enjoyed a dominant position in
the organisations of the working class. The acceptance of a
revolutionary programme (albeit undeclared) does not automatically
confer political leadership on those who have presented it &#8211; a
lesson many times repeated then and since. In the situation of
Bolivia, the paradox was all the more evident. For it was the
leadership of the miners&#8217; union, and Juan Lech&#237;n in particular,
who would now be called upon to implement the <em>Theses</em> &#8211; and
Lech&#237;n belonged to the MNR. It was a contradiction that would return
to haunt the movement after the revolution.</p>

<p>The period between 1946 and 1952 was a time of bitter repression.
Villarroel was lynched by a crowd in July 1946 &#8211; in subsequent
elections the POR won a parliamentary seat. But the new government
turned once again on the trade unions and, with the collaboration of
the Stalinists, pursued and murdered a number of leading activists.
Lech&#237;n and Lora were arrested in 1949, and an occupation of the
Catavi mine ended with the murder of 300 workers. In September that
year the MNR launched an armed rising, with the support of the
miners. Although it failed within a couple of months, the workers had
controlled a number of towns for brief periods of time. In the months
that followed there were strikes and armed confrontations across the
mining areas in which both the POR and MNR members took a leading role.</p>

<p>The MNR, despite its earlier ambiguities, became increasingly
identified with opposition to the military government, and with the
militant trade union movement. When the MNR&#8217;s candidates, Paz
Estenssorro and Siles Suazo, won the presidential elections in 1951
the military refused to recognise the result and sought to impose
military control.</p>

<p>On the night of 10 April 1952 workers across the country polished
their concealed weapons and set out to confront the military
detachments that had been sent out to stop them. In La Paz the army&#8217;s
lines of retreat were cut off by armed miners from the town of Oruro,
which was now under workers&#8217; control after the military commander
had turned his guns on the crowds in the town square and murdered 90
people. Conscripts in uniform very quickly remembered their origins,
and turned their caps to show they had changed sides. And the armed
workers&#8217; militia controlled the streets.</p>

<p>The situation that Siles and Paz faced was extraordinary.
Consistent with their strategy of taking power through a military
coup supported by a mass movement in the streets, they had
anticipated that this would be the pattern in April 1952. Instead the
army defended the old regime to the last, and it was the armed
workers who seized control of the situation. After three days of
fighting, which left 600 dead, the working class was effectively in
power. On 17 April the first national trade union federation, the
COB, was formed. It organised peasants, students, community groups
and tenants as well as trade unions and was for a brief period &#8216;the
only centre of power worthy of the name&#8217;. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a> The workers&#8217;
militia controlled the streets &#8211; on May Day 40,000 workers marched
through the streets of the capital with arms in hand.</p>

<p>The acting MNR president, Siles Suazo, responded astutely to the
situation. He appointed three working class leaders to his cabinet &#8211;
Lech&#237;n for the miners, Butron for the factory workers and Angel
Cromez of the transport union. For Lora and the POR, the dominant
position of the COB guaranteed their continuing control of the
situation. Lech&#237;n was the COB&#8217;s man in government and, given the
balance of forces in those first revolutionary days, would follow the
dictates of the movement. The POR argued for the COB to take power,
but Lechin and the other worker ministers wanted to share power with
the MNR. With their customary skill and cunning Lech&#237;n and Siles
rode the revolutionary tide, adopting the demands for nationalisation
of the mines and the redistribution of land to the peasants.</p>

<p>Lech&#237;n&#8217;s role is central. Lora described him as &#8216;incarnating
the radicalism of the masses&#8217;. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a> The POR saw him as sympathetic
to their positions, and relied on him to carry the politics of
workers&#8217; power into the cabinet. In reality Lech&#237;n was developing
a radical working class politics for the MNR, and conducting an
internal political battle using the COB to strengthen his position
within that party. The reality of the days and weeks after the
revolution was that power lay with the organised working class &#8211;
briefly, the POR was a powerful political influence within the
movement. But it did not use the moment to forge the instrument of
political leadership that would enable it to consolidate and organise
its alternative strategy for the state. Instead it placed enormous
reliance on the very &#8216;worker ministers&#8217; it had warned against in
the <em>Pulacayo Theses</em>.</p>

<p>The reliance on Lech&#237;n stemmed from a conviction that the MNR
would immediately betray the revolution and drive the working class
and the workers&#8217; leaders into the arms of the revolutionary left.
But the MNR acquiesced in and supported many of the demands of the
working class, crucially the nationalisation of the mines &#8211; indeed,
they went further and argued for &#8216;workers&#8217; control&#8217; (<em>control
obrero</em>) of the mines. Thus the miners saw the victory as won, and
the POR did not argue the need to control the whole of Bolivian
society and transform the state &#8211; perhaps it also saw the victory
as won. The result was to reinforce the insularity of the mining
communities <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a>, which, in a contradictory way, was the source of
their extraordinary resolution and solidarity.</p>

<p>In effect, the leadership of the COB elected to share power with
the MNR, and the MNR skilfully used the situation to establish its
control over the working class movement. From 1952 to 1953 power
still lay with the working class &#8211; the workers&#8217; militia continued
to accumulate arms, for example. The gains they made in that period
were real and dramatic, symbolised by the nationalisation of the
mines. Yet the seeds of defeat were already present at the moment of
greatest triumph. On 31 October 1952 the mines were nationalised &#8211;
but compensation was paid to the previous owners. Simon Pati&#241;o&#8217;s
company paid $400 in taxes that year &#8211; and received $900 million in
compensation. Further, the nationalisation decree was specific and
limited. The POR attacked the MNR for this, but by now the POR had
lost much of its influence at the national level, and Lech&#237;n felt
secure enough by early 1953 to break publicly with the POR &#8211; they
had served his purposes well enough.</p>

<p>To a large extent the influence that the POR had exercised in the
months immediately after the April insurrection was shown to have
been dependent on Lech&#237;n&#8217;s goodwill. Once that goodwill was
withdrawn, their influence was reduced to its proper proportions. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a></p>

<p>The opportunities to build revolutionary organisation in such
favourable conditions come rarely and last only a short time. By
mid-1953 Lora recognised that the moment had passed. His comrades in
the Fourth International, however, disagreed, and insisted that the
MNR could still be driven to the left and won to a revolutionary
perspective. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a> The consequence, of course, was that many of the
POR&#8217;s leading trade unionists moved into the MNR &#8211; the logical
consequence of a politics which continued to paint the nationalist
leadership with communist colours.</p>

<p>It was no accident that the next COB congress did not occur until
1954. By then the trade unions were largely controlled by bureaucrats
newly appointed by Lech&#237;n and the MNR. The peasant farmers, who had
taken little or no part in the April rising, were nevertheless drawn
into the process by the conscious activity of the radical leadership
of the COB. By 1954,however, the enactment of a capitalist land
reform had created a new class of small rural capitalists who were
equally dependent on government. The rebuilding of the army was under
way, and the mining industry was beginning to be decapitalised and
state development spending turned towards newer, mainly agricultural
sectors outside the highlands. Two years later, in 1956, the
government of Siles Suazo would introduce a Stabilisation Plan whose
purpose was the reintegration of the Bolivian economy into the world
market. By now the MNR government felt strong enough to turn on its
erstwhile allies and attack the trade unions. The combative response
of workers across the country led Siles to turn to his old allies in
the army, an army rebuilt by him in anticipation of just such a
moment. At the same time, the mining industry would be consigned to a
slow death and, with external aid from the end of the 1950s, new
areas of private capitalist development would be financed and encouraged.</p>

<p>The second Bolivian Revolution, whenever it came, would arise in a
very different Bolivia &#8211; but the memory of 1952 would leave an
important political legacy for the next generation of resisters.<br/>

<h4>A curious blend: water, coca and oil</h4>

<p class="fst">Among those who demonstrated in Cochabamba in February 2000 were
the <em>cocaleros</em>, the coca farmers of Chapare. Many of them were
ex-miners who had been encouraged to move down to the area around
Cochabamba by the grant of small plots of land. Coca, of course, is a
legal crop in Bolivia, sold from enormous sacks in the street
markets. The tradition of coca chewing is part of the experience of
life at high altitude, where food is often scarce and labour hard and
unrewarding. El T&#237;o, the protective god of the mine, is offered coca
every Friday morning, and the leaves form part of most communal ceremonials.</p>

<p>The huge expansion in heroin and cocaine consumption in the West,
and the US in particular, from the early 1970s onwards transformed
the economies of Latin America. By the late 1990s cocaine represented
8 percent of global trade. An apparently bottomless demand created
the multimillionaires of Colombia, Peru and eastern Bolivia, not to
mention the anonymous wealthy entrepreneurs who facilitate the trade
north of the Rio Grande. Successive US governments launched and
relaunched eradication programmes against drugs through the 1980s and
1990s, attacking the origin of the leaf rather than the social causes
of its massive levels of consumption within the US. In 1988 agreement
was reached with the Bolivian government to limit levels of
cultivation to meet local demand &#8211; unlike Colombia, Bolivia did not
have to deal with blanket herbicide spraying, but it did have to
accept the presence of US Drug Enforcement Agency personnel on its
soil. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></p>

<p>Under Banzer (1997&#8211;2000) &#8211; the same man who had made shadowy
fortunes out of the drugs in the 1970s &#8211; the campaign against coca
production was stepped up. The <em>cocaleros</em> themselves, however,
were already on a battle footing, having joined with other peasant
organisations in a coalition which in 1999 became the MAS (the
Movement Towards Socialism), taking up the name of a previously
existing group in order to register for the 2002 elections. Its
leader, whose face had become well known in the earlier campaigns
against eradication, was Evo Morales, who would become a key figure
in the events of the coming years.</p>

<p>The <em>cocaleros</em> were central actors in the Cochabamba events
of 2000.The impact of the neo-liberal reforms launched after 1985 on
the land was to restructure production around export crops and open
the country to imports of cheaper food. For small farmers, the threat
could be allayed to some extent by turning their land over to growing
coca. The eradication programme, however, was a direct attack on
their livelihood, and water privatisation would sound a death knell
as production in the Chapare fell significantly. There has been a
flow of aid from the US and the European Union into projects designed
to promote alternative crops, but these have rarely been able to
offer an income comparable to the earnings from growing coca. More
importantly, perhaps, US aid has often been conditional on abandoning
the established forms of communal organisation and replacing them
with individual land titles &#8211; and that in its turn has provoked
resistance on cultural and ideological grounds.</p>

<p>Many of those who had moved away from the mining areas of the
highlands had gone to Chapare. Others moved towards the city of El
Alto, an indigenous satellite city high above the capital, La Paz.
They brought with them the Aymara language (or its variants, like
Aymara-Quechua),and the traditions of communal organisation
reinforced by the Katarista tradition and, after 1996, by the impact
of the movement led by Felipe Quispe el Mallku. They were also the
bearers of a collective memory of extraordinary workers&#8217; struggles
in the relentlessly harsh environs of the high Andes.</p>

<p>There were other important sectors of Bolivian society which had
suffered the direct impact of neo-liberalism. There were the civil
servants, teachers and other state employees who were the victims of
a 50 percent cut in state employment (the police, after all, launched
their own strike in 2000). The growth of the private sector in the
areas they might once have worked in did not replace their jobs &#8211;
by definition the multinationals were centrally administered outside
the country, and were in any case invariably capital intensive. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a>
There were the students of the deteriorating state university sector,
and especially the University of El Alto, whose prospects of finding
work were minimal. And there were the pensioners whose state pensions
after the mine closures often went unpaid because the state pension
fund was shrinking as a new neo-liberal pension scheme directed money
into private pension funds. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p>All of these sectors had come under attack in one way or another
as a result of the neo-liberal strategies imposed by all the
post-1985 governments, but particularly by Lozada and his successor,
Banzer. In the five years after the Cochabamba rising each of these
social groups drew both inspiration and confidence from their
participation in the movement against privatisation of water. From
February 2000 onwards there is a pattern in Bolivia of highway
blockades, marches, protests, strikes and collective resistance which
evolves and develops towards new levels of intensity and new forms of
organisation &#8211; culminating in the demand for a Revolutionary
Popular Assembly in the aftermath of the 2005 actions. Their
immediate impulse, without any question, comes from the Cochabamba
victory. Events elsewhere in Latin America also have their impact.
And yet the expressions of this developing mass struggle often have
as their reference points a long history of resistance.</p>

<p>In 2002 presidential elections were to be held. Evo Morales,
leader of the <em>cocaleros</em> and candidate of the MAS, presented
his candidacy and won 22 percent of the national vote. This has to be
set in the context of a political environment in which most political
parties were essentially machines for government and/or apparatuses
to advance the careers of power hungry politicians. The mass
movements that had developed through the1990s were linked by their
common distrust of party politicians &#8211; or indeed politics of any
kind. Oscar Olivera, leader of the Cochabamba movement, expressed
that caution in a seminar in La Paz in June of 2000:</p>

<p class="quoteb">For the true nation not to be supplanted by the market or
the state, the working class, both urban and rural, and the
marginalised and economically insecure of the nation &#8211; in other
words, the overwhelming majority of society &#8211; must assume control
over the wealth embodied in hydrocarbons. And they must do so through
assembly-style forms of self-organisation at the neighbourhood,
regional and national levels. The nation must enact a
self-presentation &#8211; it must self-govern through autonomous
structures of participation that socialise responsibility for public
life. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Olivera&#8217;s description of the movement closely corresponds to
what did emerge in the subsequent four years. But his words are
imbued with a notion of mass organisation and resistance in isolation
from the political life of the state &#8211; including involvement with
the institutions of representative democracy. Morales&#8217;s candidacy
in 2002 exposed a tension at the heart of the movement. On the one
hand, his support clearly came from those who regarded him as a
representative of the movement, rather than of the party in whose
name he stood &#8211; MAS &#8211; because Bolivian electoral law required
that he stand on behalf of an officially registered political
organisation. On the other hand, his entry into the electoral arena
proposed an alternative dynamic, a different kind of resolution, to
the kind of power enacted from below that Olivera was proposing. But
what remained unclear, and still does, is what the political
expression of such a movement would be &#8211; and how it would address
the continuing power of the state. The experience of 1952 had left
little doubt as to the consequences of such an omission.</p>

<p>For the moment, however, Bolivia&#8217;s political future was not
being played out in the Congress but in the streets &#8211; and in
particular in the streets of El Alto:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Traffic moves constantly over the black mud that covers
roads and pavements; the sound of car horns mingles with Andean
music, played on pan pipes or electric guitars, and the shouts of
people buying-selling-complaining-bargaining. Hundreds of lorries
prepare to dive into the bowl of La Paz or to haul themselves up the
interminable mountain roads. This is El Alto, 4,100 metres above sea
level, where the freezing air blows down from the snow-capped
Cordillera. Its population is around 800,000; 81 percent describe
themselves as indigenous people. The majority are poor, 20 percent
have no access to drinking water or sewerage, 75 percent have no
health cover and around 40 percent are illiterate. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Yet this is a highly organised population, gathered in a series of
local and communal organisations which alone can guarantee their
survival in such hostile and unforgiving conditions. Zibechi
describes them in detail:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There are mothers&#8217; circles, youth and cultural
associations, centres for immigrants from different regions,
associations of migrant workers, family organisations that specialise
in organising education, and COR, the Regional Workers&#8217;
Organisation of El Alto which brought together groupings of small
traders, artisans and sectoral workers. Since its creation in 1988 it
has worked closely with Fejuve, the powerful federation of community
organisations. It was their joint agitation, for example, which led
to the creation of the public University of El Alto in 2001.</p>

<p class="fst">The 40,000 market stalls along the main highway through El Alto,
for example, are not individually owned but are collective property
allocated by the appropriate organisation. The provision of public
services is decided for each area in public meetings and assemblies,
while educational provision is the remit of the family organisations.
Furthermore, the leaders of the organisations have to fulfil a series
of conditions in order to be eligible &#8211; they cannot be speculators,
nor traders, nor belong to any political party. According to Pablo
Mamani, head of sociology at El Alto University, these organisations
share features with the Andean communities in their structure,their
control of territory and their forms of organisation. And it was
precisely these organisations, and their horizontal networks, which
were mobilised during the insurrectionary actions of 2003.</p>

<p>In February that year there were major protests in El Alto and
elsewhere against a government attempt to impose an additional 9
percent tax on income. The police joined the protest, and a number of
public buildings were razed to the ground. On the altiplano, the
movement led by Mallku blocked principal highways in protest at a
number of unresolved demands regarding land. The government responded
with repression, and four peasant farmers were killed. Then, on 19
September in La Paz, a massive 500,000-strong demonstration assembled
to demand the return of Bolivia&#8217;s gas reserves to public ownership.
They also raised the call for a constituent assembly. When Lozada
refused to responded, the organisations of El Alto combined to
organise an indefinite <em>paro c&#237;vico</em>, a general civic strike.
In Chapare the <em>cocaleros</em> barricaded highways, and other
roadblocks began to appear around La Paz. As food began to run short,
Lozada sent troops into El Alto &#8211; in the confrontations that
followed 70 died, and many more were wounded.</p>

<p>It was too much for Lozada. Unable to drive through the
Hydrocarbons Law which would effectively have ceded control of
Bolivian gas to the foreign multinationals, he resigned and fled the
country on 17 October. His successor, Carlos Mesa, promised a
referendum on the issue of gas. But he had no intention of
nationalising &#8211; he would not break existing agreements with foreign
multinationals, he announced. And the ballot paper contained no
mention of nationalisation. Then, in March 2004, the Bolivian
Congress passed a new law which added 32 percent taxes to the 18
percent royalties those companies paid. It was still far from what
the movement demanded &#8211; but it was too much for Mesa, who tried to
veto the law. Yet the Supreme Court, headed by Eduardo Rodriguez,
declared all previous contracts null and void.</p>

<p>The political tensions which already existed within the movement
itself were exacerbated by the confusion deliberately sown by Mesa.
Morales&#8217;s electoral success in 2002 appeared to open up a
possibility of answering the demands of the Gas Coalition without
challenging the state. It was an illusion carefully fostered by
Morales and sustained by many outside Bolivia &#8211; a promise of reform
that flew in the face of the whole of Bolivia&#8217;s recent history. But
for Morales and the MAS the experience of 1952 was not the key
reference point &#8211; in late 2003 his perspective could be legitimated
by setting Bolivia within a Latin American framework. Here Lula had
just been elected to the Brazilian presidency as the candidate of the
Workers Party, Lucio Guti&#233;rrez still presented himself as the
candidate of the Ecuadorean popular movement, Kirchner in Argentina
claimed to speak with the voice of the <em>Argentinazo</em>, and in
Venezuela Hugo Ch&#225;vez had survived two attempts to bring him down.</p>

<p>In fact, Morales had thrown his weight behind Mesa as Lozada&#8217;s
replacement. But his growing moderation seemed not to impress the
rank and file movement &#8211; in the 2004 municipal elections his voted
was halved to 11 percent nationwide. Indeed, by May 2005 the mass
movement had grown weary of Mesa&#8217;s wheeling and dealing and the
prevarications of Morales. The protest movement was renewed with a
clear and simple demand &#8211; nationalisation. On 16 May a symbolic
encirclement of La Paz announced a new phase of struggle. The COR
called for another <em>paro c&#237;vico</em> &#8211; a civic strike &#8211; which
was launched in El Alto on 23 May. The following day indigenous
Aymara protesters from Felipe Quispe&#8217;s movement came within yards
of the Congress, before they were driven back.</p>

<p>El Alto was again at the heart of a national movement. But there
were important differences from 2003. First, the level of
participation was higher and the degree of coordination across the
country was significantly greater. There were occupations in
Cochabamba and Oruro, and actions in Santa Cruz province. In El Alto
itself the indefinite strike caused serious problems of supply,
particularly of petrol, for the capital. Most significantly, perhaps,
the indigenist movement had now moved into El Alto, which it began to
describe as the headquarters of the Aymara rebellion. Thus
organisations of workers in the mainly small workplaces in and around
La Paz, the teachers&#8217; unions, Fejuve and the community groups,
housing cooperatives and student groups were at the heart of a broad
movement which had a single, unified demand &#8211; nationalisation of
oil and gas.</p>

<p>The deepening crisis of the ruling class was becoming obvious.
Mesa&#8217;s compromises and corruptions had failed to hold the movement
back. His resignation had become inevitable &#8211; and the internal
battle for the succession centred on the Senate leader, Vaca D&#237;ez,
who represented the business interests of Santa Cruz which were now
demanding regional autonomy and a right to secession for Bolivia&#8217;s
wealthiest province. His bid also failed, and the interim replacement
for Mesa, Supreme Court head Rodr&#237;guez, represented little more than
a holding operation.</p>

<p>Here the role of Evo Morales becomes both more central and more
sinister. On 26 May a brief truce opened a space for the Catholic
church to intervene with a proposal that linked issues of human
rights, regional autonomy and the demand for a constituent assembly.
This was clearly an attempt to reinforce, or perhaps more accurately
to create, a middle ground of compromise that could pull back the
movement from its revolutionary objectives. And in this the support
of Evo Morales was critical. Announcing his electoral running mate,
Garc&#237;a Linera, a supporter of Quispe and an ex-guerrilla of the
Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army, Morales and the MAS set out to embrace
and recruit to their project of compromise and reform the
increasingly militant indigenous movement.</p>

<p>But events were accelerating away, though it has to be
acknowledged that the intervention of MAS and the church produced a
kind of hiatus and a confusion deliberately sown. On the face of it
the demand for a constituent assembly may have seemed to differ very
little from the call for a National Popular and Indigenous Assembly.
In fact, the constituent assembly was a body whose elected delegates
would function as a bourgeois parliament until and unless the
bourgeoisie &#8211; reeling now under the impact of the mass popular
rising &#8211; could find ways to reimpose their institutional order
which, for the moment, was irredeemably corrupt and incapable of functioning.</p>

<p>It became obvious in June, by contrast, that the model already
being constructed at a local level was for a very different kind of
assembly, a form of mass democracy recalling the great popular
decision-making gatherings of the 19th century called &#8216;<em>cabildos
abiertos</em>&#8217; &#8211; open local governments. These assemblies enshrine
the project for the future that can carry through not only the
nationalisation of oil and gas, the immediate demand, but also
establish the existence of a new kind of power &#8211; democratic,
accountable, and controlled by the producers.</p>

<p>Mesa&#8217;s resignation on 6 June was a victory for the mass
insurrectionary movement. He had threatened to resign twice before in
the face of protests over price rises &#8211; but, in the absence of any
alternative, the bourgeoisie had kept him in power for a further
three months. For Evo Morales, his departure opened a space he could
clearly see himself as filling &#8211; and he rushed to present himself
as the saviour of the Bolivian state. It may well be that he will be
the successful candidate at the elections of 2007 &#8211; but his role
will be to restore and legitimise a state that has been brought to
the edge of collapse by a determined mass movement from below. And
what of the future? The speed of events is illustrated in the shifts
of position within the MAS. The sociologist and one-time guerrilla
leader Alvaro Garc&#237;a Linera is a key supporter of Morales &#8211; and
will probably be his electoral running mate. In a fascinating
interview <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a>, Linera is explicit &#8211; the MAS project is for the
creation of a strong Bolivian capitalism.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>Linera:</em> Socialism is not a viable project in
Bolivia, because it can only be built by a strong working class base.
The socialist utopia emerges from the extreme maturity of capitalism.
In Bolivia there is no capitalism; 70 percent of urban workers are in
small family businesses. You can&#8217;t build socialism out of small
business, but on the basis of advanced industries, and we don&#8217;t
have that in Bolivia. You can&#8217;t build socialism where 95 percent of
the rural population live in traditional communal economies.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>Interviewer:</em> So what kind of society is MAS trying
to build?</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>Linera:</em> A version of Andean capitalism.</p>

<p class="fst">Linera goes on to discuss the problems MAS is having in its
negotiations with other organisations &#8211; with Felipe Quispe the
Aymara leader, with Jaime Solares of the COB, and with the leadership
of the coordinating organisation of community groups, Fejuve. It is
hard, he argues, because everyone wants to be part of the electoral slate.</p>

<p>Yet the promise that Evo Morales represents echoes the rhetoric of
Lula in Brazil and Lucio Guti&#233;rrez in Ecuador. Linera is quite clear
that MAS&#8217;s hope lies in an alliance with Lula, Chavez and the other
new populist regimes in Uruguay and Argentina. Leaving aside the
discredit into which the Lula government is falling, the programme
for a revitalised and strengthened alliance of capitals does not
challenge the neo-liberal project. On the contrary, it merely offers
the prospect of a government that will mediate between global capital
and the mass movements that had carried each to power. A future
Morales government will function to restore a Bolivian state vying
for a place at the banqueting tables of Davos and the WTO. Yet the
fundamental irony of all this is that global capital, and the US
government, will only tolerate such regimes because of the strength
of the mass movement &#8211; and until that strength is sapped, or the
movement weakened or diverted.</p>

<p>What has become incontestably clear in the last five years is that
the Bolivian mass movement is anti-capitalist in its spirit and its
demands. It is an insurrection that has challenged not simply the
conduct of successive governments but their strategy. The
privatisation of resources &#8211; their transformation into commodities
bought and sold on a world market by private capitalists &#8211; is the
object of their rage and their resistance. It is true that there has
been a debate about whether a higher level of taxation of foreign
corporations would be enough &#8211; but that demand was first suggested
by the now ejected Mesa, and only later taken up by Morales and the
MAS for their own purposes. And while in 2004 that was echoed across
the movement, its radicalisation since then has left the argument for
50 percent taxation as the demand of the moderates, while the central
policy of the combative majority of the movement in 2005 has been for
the nationalisation of Bolivia&#8217;s gas and oil resources. Used for
the general good, they could transform the Bolivian economy &#8211; but
not in the context of a neo-liberal market.</p>

<p>The alternative is a transformation that fully realises the demand
for democratic control over the economy enshrined in a new state. The
people&#8217;s assemblies that developed in the May/June days were the
embryonic expression of a new kind of power &#8211; democratic,
accountable and transparent. As yet, that experience has not been
embodied in an equivalent national organisation, though it has been
proposed and argued for in the local gatherings. In part, that is the
result of confusion about the demand for a constituent assembly as an
electoral forum &#8211; in part it is also a consequence of the lack of
political coordination and agreement in the movement.</p>

<p>The analysis put forward by the miners&#8217; union (FSTMB) argues
that the task is to &#8216;forge the political instrument of the working
class&#8217; <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a> &#8211; the revolutionary organisation capable of unifying
and giving strategic political direction to the many forces that have
waged such a heroic and successful struggle against the present state
over the last five years. No one on the left would disagree with that
as a general and abstract proposition. But the reality is that the
COB, which has played that role historically in Bolivia, no longer
fills that central role. The definitive crushing of the miners in
1984&#8211;85, and the rapid decline of the tin mining industry that
followed it, marked the end of the era when mining was Bolivia&#8217;s
central industry. In fact, of course, it had long ceased to be
sufficient to sustain the economy, yet until that moment there was an
uninterrupted tradition to refer to in the political debate.</p>

<p>Where is the working class in Bolivia today? It is dispersed
across the country. In Santa Cruz it is the oil workers. In the
mining areas it is the small cooperatives working to extract metal
under terrible working conditions in the now declining and
increasingly dangerous mine workings. In El Alto and La Paz the COB&#8217;s
influence is largely restricted to teachers and health workers. The
manufacturing and productive units in the region are for the most
part small workshops producing consumer goods &#8211; the workplaces
rarely employ more than ten people. They are organised by the COR, a
regional trade union federation rooted in El Alto. More importantly,
these organisations are essentially concerned with developing a
militant trade unionism &#8211; a syndicalist position which does not
pose the question of state power, but is seduced by notions of
political spaces autonomous of and separate from the state.</p>

<p>And that working class is also indigenous &#8211; 81 percent of El
Alto consider themselves to be Indian (Aymara and Quechua), and the
same is true among the <em>cocaleros</em>. It is a mark of the
qualitative development of the movement that Quispe&#8217;s indigenous
peasant movement has become active in the urban environment as well
as in the highlands. But it is also evidence of its continuing
authority. In the past, in 1952 for example, the demands of
indigenous communities were largely marginalised &#8211; they were seen
as anachronistic and inhibiting the modernising project represented
by the working class movement. In the situation of the late 1970s and
early 1980s,however, it was these communities that fought the state
and developed forms of mass confrontation which have certainly
informed and shaped the more recent mobilisations. For nearly 20
years, communal resistance was the centre of the popular movement in Bolivia.</p>

<p>The fact that other sections have now emerged to take on the state
is a great leap for the movement, but the ideas of the indigenist
movements are still powerful. Community and territorial unity are
still central even in the urban struggles. And the suspicion of
political organisations among them reflects a real experience of
manipulation and opportunism by political leaders in the past. Many
of the communal organisations, for example, do not allow members of
political parties to stand for leadership positions. In their
perception, the left is not exempt from that charge.</p>

<p>Between March and June 2005 the Bolivian mass rising crossed an
important frontier. Its confidence and determination grew out of the
successful challenge to Lozada, the renewed struggles around gas
privatisation that began in February this year, and Mesa&#8217;s
subsequent bluff in March. The tactic backfired on him, but it both
deepened the conviction of the resistance and exposed the rifts
within the ruling class itself, particularly between the Santa Cruz
oligarchs and the powers centred in La Paz.</p>

<p>The effect was to radicalise the movement even further and to
propitiate an emerging unity of the many forces in struggle. On 16
May, while100,000 people besieged the parliament in La Paz, the
miners began a march towards El Alto and the teachers&#8217; union
launched a strike. Inexorably the movement&#8217;s actions moved towards
9 June, the high point of this phase of the &#8216;Bolivian Revolution of
the 21st century&#8217;. On that day a powerless government faced a mass
popular movement that was resolute, coordinated and proposing
alternative forms of power.</p>

<p>Yet within days it seemed that the unity was fracturing and the
confidence faltering.</p>

<p>The new president, Rodr&#237;guez, was a transitional figure &#8211; he
immediately proposed presidential elections for December. This opened
up the possibility of a solution to the deep crisis the country was
facing within the structures of the existing state. And it won the
instant approval of the MAS, whose candidate, Evo Morales, would be
the likely winner of such a contest. Thus within a matter of two days
the political focus was shifted back towards an electoral solution
and a restoration of the system, and away from the revolutionary
demands for a different kind of power and the suspicions of the
electoral process voiced just days earlier by the people&#8217;s
assembly. The government side was strengthened too by the tantalising
promise of a recognition of Aymara national rights in a new constitution.</p>

<p>The situation, of course, is far from over &#8211; and the movement
far from demobilised. But it is confused as to its next steps and
unclear in its direction. Unity in struggle has not translated itself
into a strategic political unity. Yet the future outcome of the
movement will be critically shaped by its capacity to develop that
general strategy for the conquest of the Bolivian state. Bolivian
history is eloquent when it comes to illustrating the revenge that
awaits movements that do not pursue their independent purposes but
seek compromises and negotiations in the corridors of power.</p>

<p>The Bolivian mass insurrection is an extraordinary movement for
its absolute determination, its courage in struggle, its insistent
collective impulse, its combination of many different demands. In
1952 that most powerful of instruments, the COB, made unity a class
issue, and drew peasant and indigenous struggles behind a working
class leadership that could have been capable of challenging the
state. Yet indigenous struggles were subordinated to class politics
rather than fused with them. The demise of the COB &#8211; for both
material (the decline of mining) and political (the internal
divisions that were in part the consequence of defeat) reasons &#8211;
has left the movement with no coordinating, centralising force. There
are some left groups influential within the COB today who might claim
that it does lead the movement. That is simply not true, and nothing
is gained from the pretence that a ready-made programme and a
self-proclaimed directorate is all that is required to achieve
leadership of this complex and varied movement. There is a dominant
ideology, which is sectional, nationalist, communal and in many
sections syndicalist. All of these currents militate against the
forging of a common politics whose purpose is the conquest of power.</p>
<p>The Bolivian ruling class and its neo-liberal masters are
certainly preparing new instruments of exploitation, new schemes to
deliver control of Bolivia&#8217;s natural resources to global capital or
its surrogates in the IMF or the other international agencies. It is
the task of revolutionaries to relentlessly expose the nature of
these projects, and to challenge the notion that capitalism&#8217;s
solutions to its own crises can ever fail to be at the expense of
workers and peasants. Evo Morales is already attempting to sow those
illusions. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p>So the struggles and the resistance will continue. The future,
however, will depend on the ability of those who argue for the
politics of class struggle to embrace the demands for indigenous
rights, education, housing, health, the right to work, the use of
resources for the benefit of all, as class demands which will be won
through the collective action of workers who may speak several
languages, dress in different ways, retain different histories, live
in different environments, but whose experience is increasingly that
of a single class confronting a hostile and exploitative capital. And
because it sits at the heart of a continent, the echoes of its
struggles and successes have been and will be heard by all those who
are facing the same global enemy.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f28" name="n28">28.</a> Morales has found an enthusiastic ally in Venezuela&#8217;s
president, Hugo Ch&#225;vez, who intervened in his support during the
June events. Yet Chavez himself declared, in January 2005 at the
World Social Forum, that he was an advocate of socialist revolution.
Chavez&#8217;s dilemma is a reflection of the intense and continuing
debate within the movement &#8211; a debate in which Evo Morales does not
and cannot represent a revolutionary future.</p>
