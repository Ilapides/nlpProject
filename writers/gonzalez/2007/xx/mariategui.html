<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="fst">Jos&#233; Carlos Mari&#225;tegui was born into a society in crisis, a Peru
deeply divided between a coastal sector where most of Peru&#8217;s
capitalist class was concentrated, an emerging mining industry in the
central valley between Lima and Huancavelica, and a mountain region
which Mari&#225;tegui described as &#8220;semi-feudal&#8221;. Here 40 percent of
the population lived in small, isolated communities, eking a
precarious living on the high Andean slopes. They were forced to give
their labour to the powerful local landowning class which
administered the region without any real influence from Lima, the
capital of a weak state.</p>

<p>A brief period of prosperity in the mid-19th century was based on
the export of the natural fertiliser guano and the extraction of
nitrates, with British capital entirely controlling trade in both
commodities. During the 300 years of colonial rule mining had been
the central source of wealth in the region. With the rise of guano
and nitrates the focus of the economy shifted towards the coast and
foreign trade. Peru&#8217;s small, emerging bourgeoisie grew in the
shadow of the foreign capital on which it was wholly dependent. In
the sierra the century saw an expansion of often huge landholdings
(or latifundia) into what had been communal, indigenously owned lands.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The emerging state, therefore, was an expression of the
symbiosis of the interests of these large and medium landowners, for
whom the institutions of the state served the principal function of
legitimising the pillage of the small producers and the definition of
the peasant masses as a source of labour, taxes and cannon fodder.
<a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The growing costs of public administration were met by borrowing
from European banks, while imports grew to four times the value of
exports. At the same time, foreign capital was also sustaining the
growth of coastal export agriculture, particularly sugar and later
cotton. In the sierra the latifundios&#8217; expansion occurred in order
to cover local demand as well as to provide a steady stream of cheap
and exploited indigenous labour. As the century advanced Peru was
entering into a relationship with the global economy, which only
emphasised and deepened the already enormous gulf between the modern
coast and a mountain world of non-Spanish speaking and racially
oppressed indigenous peoples. Where they fought back, they were
repressed with exemplary brutality. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p>The so-called Pacific War of 1879&#8211;84 was catastrophic for the
Peruvian bourgeoisie. It lost the port of Tacna and most of the
nitrate-producing areas to Chile, and the resulting economic collapse
left it, as Mari&#225;tegui put it, &#8220;bleeding and mutilated&#8221;, and
with no resources with which to resist the effective transfer of the
economy into foreign hands. The contract for the Central Valley
Railway, for example, went to the British based Grace Corporation,
and mining came under the direct control of the Peruvian Corporation
and the Cerro del Paso Corporation. The main banks were British
owned, and foreign interests like the Gildemeisters or Peruvian
capital working in combination with external investors such as the
Larcos assumed control over agriculture. In the cities, and in
particular in Lima and Cuzco, the ancient Inca capital, new
industries were emerging as a result of this new economic activity &#8211;
in particular textiles.</p>

<p>Yet the original inhabitants of Peru experienced increasingly
exploitative conditions, which were unmitigated by the developments
taking place on the coast. On the contrary, their exploitation
intensified as the modern sector of the Peruvian economy developed.
It was one of Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s important insights that these two
phenomena were interdependent: that modernisation not only could, but
actually needed to, maintain the backwardness of the sierra and the
forms of servile labour that persisted there &#8211; like the <em>enganche</em>,
obligatory labour, and <em>yanaconazgo</em>, a form of debt peonage.</p>

<p>There was resistance, of course. Indigenous rebellions and
anarchist led trade unions were two forms of it. There was also a
middle class movement, directed against the old landed aristocracy
and their control and manipulation of the state, which found
political expression in <em>civilismo</em>, founded in the mid-1870s by
Manuel Pardo. This was a movement seeking to create a strong state
committed to modernisation. But by the beginning of the 20th century
it had split into two wings, one compromised with the old elite and
committed to the continuation of economic growth based on foreign
investment, the other more committed to modernisation, an end to
corruption and a strategy of national growth. The individual who came
to represent this more radical wing was Augusto Bernardino Legu&#237;a y
Salcedo, though Legu&#237;a never questioned the central role of foreign
capital in the process. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> He was
elected to the presidency for the first time in 1908 and would return
to power again in the momentous year of 1919.</p>

<p>In fact the most trenchant critique of the old order came from the
poet Manuel Gonz&#225;lez Prada. He exposed the moral degeneration of the
old ruling class and set it against a picture of &#8220;Indian Peru&#8221;,
which was both romantic and idealised. Yet for a new generation his
work turned their attention to the hitherto silent and invisible
native Peruvian peoples &#8211; and laid the groundwork for Mari&#225;tegui
and his generation. Despite his reputation as a defender of the
indigenous population, however, Gonz&#225;lez Prada clearly saw the decay
of Peruvian society as corrupting both rulers and ruled; though he
laid the responsibility firmly with the powerful, he never saw the
indigenous people as potential subjects of history, capable of
bringing about change through their own actions.</p>

<p>It was into this society that Mari&#225;tegui was born, in Moquegua in
1894. Growing up in Lima, Mari&#225;tegui found himself drawn to artistic
and cultural forms of dissent. In 1909, at the age of 15, he became a
printer&#8217;s apprentice; within five years he was writing regular
columns of social commentary in the newspaper <strong>La Prensa</strong> under
the pseudonym Juan Croniqueur. He was also associated with the group
of artists around Abraham Valdelomar and the magazine <strong>Col&#243;nida</strong>,
whose influence was far greater than its four issues would suggest.
There is no sign yet that Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s radicalism was political.
He did not associate himself, for example, with the anarchist
organisations that led the nascent urban working class movement.</p>

<p>It was essentially an artistic dissidence that drew Mari&#225;tegui
towards the Bohemians who &#8220;strolled&#8221; along Lima&#8217;s avenue of
artists, the Jir&#243;n de la Uni&#243;n, just as Baudelaire had strolled
along the streets of Paris &#8211; &#8221;<em>flaneurs</em>&#8221; without
direction driven by a world weariness that the great French poet had
called &#8220;spleen&#8221;. Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s writings on artistic modernism
found there the scepticism of an avant-garde pressing against
received wisdoms. But while many of his Bohemian colleagues remained
buried in an aesthetic twilight, Mari&#225;tegui began to seek out the
links between the artistic and the political vanguard.</p>

<p>By 1916 Peru was changing. In Lima the new factories, most
importantly in textiles, were creating a permanent labour force,
which was forging trade unions under the influence of anarchism. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a>
The first general strike, in support of the workers of the important
Vitarte textile plant, took place in April 1911. Although it failed,
a new law relating to accidents at work was passed in the same year,
the right to strike (though under limited circumstances) conceded in
1913 and the eight-hour day won by the workers of the port of Callao
a year later. Attacks on living standards in 1915 and 1916, as raw
materials were exported rather than finished goods and profits fell,
produced new waves of strikes and demands for a shorter working day.</p>

<p>At the same time new struggles were developing in the countryside.
The expansion of the export sector in agriculture displaced the
peasantry and increased the rapacious search for labour. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a>
The risings that culminated in Puno (the Rumi Maqui revolt) in 1915&#8211;6
showed a different aspect of the indigenous communities &#8211; as
collective fighters against the brutal mode of production prevailing
in the Andean mountains. And Puno was not the only rising. In the
central Mantaro valley there were repeated confrontations, drawing
Mari&#225;tegui and one of his colleagues to the area in 1918.</p>

<p>That year Mari&#225;tegui founded a new journal, <strong>Nuestra Epoca</strong>,
which expressed his movement from the artistic avant-garde towards a
growing political radicalism. The name of the journal, &#8220;Our Times&#8221;,
referred to more than a spirit of the age; it was a historical moment
of change and struggle. &#8220;<strong>Nuestra Epoca</strong> did not have a
socialist programme, but it must be seen as a move in that direction,
both ideologically and in propaganda terms.&#8221; <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Significantly, it lasted only two issues; it was banned after
publishing an article by Mari&#225;tegui criticising the armed forces.
Early the following year Mari&#225;tegui set up <strong>La Raz&#243;n</strong>, a
newspaper whose unambiguous purpose was to support people in
struggle. It was the first major watershed in his development as a
Marxist and a working class leader.</p>

<p>The year 1919 was a turning point. The cost of living for workers
had almost doubled since 1913, and the previous two years had seen a
series of strikes in Lima and elsewhere for wage rises and a shorter
working day. The first general union, the Federaci&#243;n Local Obrera de
Lima, was formed in 1918, and the premature creation of an organising
committee for a Socialist Party reflected the generally militant
atmosphere rather than any serious political advance. The year began
with a strike of bakers, which rapidly became general, under the
leadership of anarcho-syndicalists. The government conceded the
eight-hour day, but refused wage rises. The Comit&#233; Pro-Abaratamiento
(for a lowering of prices of basic goods) formed in April, bringing
together a wide range of organisations in a series of protests, and
in May new strikes paralysed the city, leading to the arrest of three
union leaders. The declaration of a state of emergency and the arrest
of the movement&#8217;s leaders did nothing to lessen the level of
popular protest, which now coalesced around support for the return of
former president Legu&#237;a, in the belief that he would challenge the
old ruling class and introduce measures to modernise the Peruvian state.</p>

<p>Legu&#237;a took power on 4 July and immediately released the
imprisoned workers&#8217; leaders. The triumphant demonstration that
paraded them through the streets stopped outside the offices of
Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s <strong>La Raz&#243;n</strong> and invited him to join the head of
the march. The Legu&#237;a honeymoon, however, was brief. By August
Legu&#237;a was already repressing working class action. <strong>La Raz&#243;n</strong>
was suppressed, and Mari&#225;tegui and his co-editor, C&#233;sar Falc&#243;n,
were &#8220;invited to leave the country&#8221; with a grant to study abroad.
In October they left for Europe. Later Mari&#225;tegui would be accused
of taking the king&#8217;s shilling, of surrendering to Legu&#237;a. His own
explanation is that his activity was restricted as Legu&#237;a assumed
increasingly dictatorial powers, and that the working class movement
was still too weak and disoriented for him to operate successfully
within Peru. Legu&#237;a offered him the alternative of exile and
Mari&#225;tegui accepted.</p>

<p>The protests that returned Legu&#237;a to power were joined by a
growing student movement based mainly in the southern city of Cuzco.
This was a pale reflection of the hugely important university reform
movement that had begun in C&#243;rdoba, Argentina, in 1918. While
Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s activities were restricted to the workers&#8217; movement
in Lima, his contemporary Victor Ra&#250;l Haya de la Torre was emerging
as the leader of the student movement. Haya would come to represent
an alternative political direction in Peru, and indeed throughout
Latin America, enshrined in Apra, the organisation he later founded.
<a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> While at this stage Haya claimed to
be a Marxist, and criticised Mari&#225;tegui for leaving Peru, it would
become clear that his project for modernisation involved an alliance
with &#8220;progressive&#8221; sections of both the national and the
international bourgeoisie, led by the middle class. Thus there was no
contradiction for him in working with Legu&#237;a in setting up the
<em>Universidades Populares</em>, a programme for the education of
workers, in 1920. Three years later, however, Haya too would be sent
into exile by the increasingly dictatorial Peruvian president. While
today Apra is identified with corrupt regimes pressing for neoliberal
strategies, in the 1920s Haya&#8217;s claim that it was a new
revolutionary creed did win him some adherents, though its
philosophy, with its mix of Marxism, indigenism and an intense
personalism around the figure of Haya, in fact made its programme
very difficult to follow. Yet at this early stage Mari&#225;tegui
continued to work with Haya&#8217;s supporters in common projects, and
continued to do so until Haya, from Mexico, announced the formation
of his Peruvian Nationalist Party, which later became Apra.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The road to Europe and back</h4>

<p class="fst">Mari&#225;tegui had left Peru with an established reputation within
the country&#8217;s working class movement, an important body of
journalistic work and some knowledge of Marxism. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a>
His trip to Europe clearly had as one purpose the development and
deepening of that understanding. Having spent a little time in
France, he went to Italy where, as he later put it, he &#8220;acquired a
wife and some ideas&#8221;. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> He was
present at the founding conference of the Italian Communist Party at
Livorno in 1921 and learned much of his Marxism during this period.
<a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a> Arriving after the Italian factory
occupations, his articles and essays reflect his immersion in the
debates around the issue of hegemony. More importantly, Mari&#225;tegui
saw at first hand how the political weakness of the bourgeoisie and
the vacillations of reformism could permit the emergence of fascism &#8211;
and these would be the central themes in his lectures and classes on
the world situation which he gave at the <em>Universidad Populares</em>
after his return to Peru, <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> and in a
subsequent series of articles in various newspapers in 1923&#8211;4,
published later under the title <em>Figures and Aspects of
International Life</em>. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p>A great deal has been written about the various influences on
Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s Marxism, and his voracious reading and reviewing of a
wide range of European writers has encouraged that. The key point,
however, is that his contemporary writings show a very clear
recognition of the world-historical significance of the Bolshevik
Revolution of 1917 and a consistent admiration for Lenin; a dedicated
reading of current Marxist debates; and at the same time a consistent
reflection on his own reality from the perspective not so much of
Europe as of the international situation:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s insistence on the need for an
internationalist perspective is not the negation of nationalism so
much as its supersession ... It is a dialectical negation but not in
the sense that he condemns or disqualifies nationalism as a
historical necessity at a given moment in time. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p class="fst">He returned from Europe in 1923 a &#8220;convinced and committed
Marxist&#8221; (&#8220;<em>Marxista convicto y confeso</em>&#8221;) with a
developed critique of the Second International&#8217;s version of
Marxism, which waited passively for the development of capitalism
automatically to open the way to socialism. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a>
What this meant for him was demonstrated in the activities that would
absorb the remaining six and half years of his life. First, the
publication of <strong>Amauta</strong>, a magazine that would provide a
platform for political debate between all the currents of thought
within the socialist movement in Peru and beyond, and second the
working out of the key ideas that would inform his work as a trade
union and party organiser in the late 1920s.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Seven Essays</h4>

<p class="fst">Published in several stages in his magazine <strong>Amauta</strong>,
Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s key work is his <strong>Seven Essays</strong>. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a>
The central themes of his analysis of Peruvian history and society
are developed in a pathbreaking materialist account that goes beyond
any previous historical work, while setting out the framework of his
activism and the political work that would absorb the last two years
of his life. It is a book drawing on the work of several years, which
confirms that economics must provide the foundation of a Marxist
understanding, but also develops the concerns and questions that
Mari&#225;tegui has identified as central to understanding the
specificities of Peruvian history. These will shape his
organisational methods, his exploration of the class struggle and his
definition of the national reality. For some commentators, hostile in
principle to his dialectical method, this definition consigns
Mari&#225;tegui to the camp of revolutionary nationalism at best. For
others, he remains locked in a kind of irrationalism which belies his
insistence on locating the development of class consciousness in
particular material circumstances. And for the functionaries of the
late 1920s Comintern pursuing Stalin&#8217;s ultra-left &#8220;class against
class strategy&#8221;, it suggested that Mari&#225;tegui was guilty of
heterodoxy and indiscipline. Yet none of these judgments are
justified by his work, either his theoretical writing or his
practical engagement with the organs of class struggle.</p>

<p>The seven essays of the title cover religion, education,
regionalism and (the longest essay) the development of Peruvian
literature. The three key pieces, however, which open the work,
provide a historical narrative that informs and explains his
political strategy. For Mari&#225;tegui was always, first and foremost, a
strategist of revolution &#8211; and his writings the foundation and
explanation of that strategy. Analysing the Peruvian economy, he
contrasts the colonial economic system with what went before. Under
Spanish imperial rule Peru was a source of mineral wealth, its
population locked in a system of ruthless exploitation within a
structure of authoritarian control centred on the dominant colonial
class. Its religious and secular institutions were informed and
sustained by an ideology of racial superiority (&#8220;<em>pura sangre</em>&#8221;
&#8211; pure blood) which legitimated that exploitation. It was central
to Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s vision that this contrasted dramatically with the
pre-colonial, Inca, society structured around the <em>ayllu</em> system
of kinship-based collectives. Critics have been quick to point out
that these communal organisations functioned within a centralised
theocracy that was also highly repressive. Mari&#225;tegui acknowledges
as much in an extensive footnote in the essay on <em>The Problem of
the Indian</em> <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a> &#8211; and he admits
that those traditions have suffered disruptions and transformations
through three centuries of colonial rule.</p>

<p>His argument, however, is that there is a cultural continuity and
an ideological one which has ensured the maintenance of a collective
consciousness in the indigenous communities of Peru. For Mari&#225;tegui
that tradition of collective solidarity resonates with socialist
ideas, and it is the task of socialists in that society to build on
that synthesis. The importance of that &#8220;natural socialism&#8221; as
Mari&#225;tegui himself described it, however, is not because of some
romantic nativism, some sense on Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s part that socialism
was the result of cultural processes. He insisted over and over again
that ethnic characteristics were inextricably interwoven with class &#8211;
and that the indigenous community was defined by its economic
relationships with the ruling class.</p>

<p>When Peru won its independence from Spain that structure was
maintained &#8211; and indeed reinforced &#8211; as he describes in the
opening essay, <em>The Structure and Evolution of the Economy</em>. The
struggle for independence was led by a nascent bourgeoisie anxious to
break the Spanish trading monopoly rather than challenge economic
dependence on foreign trade altogether. The ruling class that emerged
from the independence wars built the new economy around guano, the
natural fertiliser deposited by seabirds on the coastal islands,
which was exported exclusively to Britain. And the colonial system of
exploitation, particularly in the mountain regions, far from being
challenged by the new dispositions, was reinforced and later
exploited as a source of cheap and pliant labour. This socio-economic
structure is defined in the essays that follow &#8211; <em>The Problem of
the Indian</em> and <em>The Problem of the land</em> &#8211; as <em>gamonalismo</em>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">[The term <em>gamonalismo</em>] designates a whole
phenomenon. It encompasses a far-reaching hierarchy of officials,
intermediaries, agents, parasites. Even the assimilated Indian is
transformed into an exploiter of his own race when he places himself
in its service. The central factor of the phenomenon is the hegemony
of the large estate in the politics and mechanism of the state. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is based on forms of servitude and debt peonage, explained by
racist stereotyping &#8211; a clear example of the interweaving of race
and class. The critical consequence of this analysis was that the
post-independence economy developed in subordination to external
interests, and maintained the forms and structures of colonial
exploitation. The Peruvian bourgeoisie, in the age of guano, and
later when the dynamic sector of the economy moved to the mines and
the coastal agricultural estates after the the Pacific War, remained
dependent upon foreign capital. It had no independent national
project of its own. And in his exploration of education, religion and
culture Mari&#225;tegui found the same characteristic parasitism and lack
of independence &#8211; though he also identified the points of
resistance and struggle, whether in the history of indigenous
rebellion or in the echoes in Peru (faint though they were) of the
university reform movement that had begun in Cordoba, Argentina, in 1918.</p>

<p>Although the <strong>Seven Essays</strong> offered a fairly comprehensive
analysis, each of them was clearly intended as the foundation for a
deeper and more extensive exploration, which was precluded by
Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s early death. But they were part of a political
project, rather than a theoretical one, in the sense that conclusions
were drawn from them in revolutionary practice.</p>

<p>His call to the workers on 1 May 1924 is a key to understanding
his strategy. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a> Calling for a
&#8220;united front&#8221; he emphasised that &#8220;we are still too few to
split into different parts&#8221;. In the working class movement the
influence of a declining anarchism was still significant, generating
a suspicion of revolutionary parties; among the students and the
social movements, the influence of Haya&#8217;s democratic nationalism
was still considerable; and in the world of the sierra, where
resistance was the stuff of everyday life, other, more local,
traditions provided the points of reference. And yet, as Mari&#225;tegui
would increasingly emphasise in his studies of Peruvian reality, and
in particular in his <strong>Seven Essays</strong>, that ideological separation
belied the role that each played in a unified economic structure
integrated into the international market.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The working class movement in this country is still too
young for us to contemplate dividing or splitting it. Before the time
of division comes, and I suppose it is inevitable, we have a great
deal of common work to do, in a spirit of solidarity. We have to
awaken in the Peruvian proletariat a class consciousness and a
feeling for their class; and that is a task for socialists and
communists, communists and libertarians equally. It is up to all of
us to win workers away from their &#8220;official representatives&#8221; and
to struggle together against repression. It is up to all of us to
defend the workers&#8217; press and workers&#8217; organisation. It is up to
all of us to support the demands of the oppressed and enslaved
indigenous race. And as we fulfil these historic responsibilities, we
shall be doing our basic duty, our roads will merge and run together
whatever our final objectives. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Any socialist strategy must of necessity build a united front of
forces, while within that unity political debate should continue to
develop and advance the centrality of Marxist ideas. But it was clear
that Mari&#225;tegui was extremely anxious to avoid sectarian splits. In
fact he was operating consistently with the positions adopted at this
stage by the international Communist movement, although, as Messeguer
suggests, he may not have been aware of the discussions taking place
in the Comintern. This drive for unity explains too his continuing
relationship with Haya de la Torre and his newly formed Peruvian
Nationalist Party, later to morph into Apra. It was an alliance that
continued with the founding of <strong>Amauta</strong> in 1926 and lasted until
the definitive break with Haya&#8217;s group in 1928.</p>

<p>It was no coincidence, therefore, that in the extraordinarily busy
year of 1928 Matri&#225;tegui founded the newspaper <strong>Labour</strong> in
November as a paper for a growing working class movement. This was in
clear anticipation of the formation of the Peruvian Congress of
Workers (CGTP), which he would be central in setting up in May of the
following year. By this time the labour force consisted of some
58,000 industrial workers (mainly in Lima but also in the southern
city of Cuzco) and some 28,000 miners. About a third of the urban
workforce was unionised; in the mines, the building of trade unions
was much harder, since the foreign mining companies immediately
dismissed (or worse) anyone who attempted to set up a union. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a>
It was critical, however, to also acknowledge that some 1.5 million
people remained within the rural and indigenous communities or were
recent migrants into agriculture or indeed into mining. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a>
The implications of that social structure for political organisation
had been a central and recurring concern in Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s writings
throughout the late 1920s. For while, as a Marxist who knew and read
Lenin, Mari&#225;tegui recognised the leading role of the working class,
he argued fiercely that a socialist movement in Peru must of
necessity address the question of building a united front of struggle
that could embrace and mobilise the majority of the exploited in that
society. His insistence on that central issue was what produced
Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s particular and original contribution to the
development of Marxism in Latin America.</p>

<p>It was the collective traditions and natural solidarity of the
indigenous communities, as he depicted them, which would ensure the
resonance of socialist ideas in the particular conditions of Peru.
But that connection could only be made consciously and deliberately
by Marxists. It was this question that he would address in the essays
collected in <strong>Peruanicemos el Per&#250;</strong>, <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a>
though it was discussed and debated in the pages of <strong>Amauta</strong>
throughout its existence. As he argued in a debate with the leading
Aprista intellectual Luis Alberto S&#225;nchez in 1927:</p>

<p class="quoteb">No one ... can be surprised by the confluence of
<em>indigenismo</em> and socialism. Socialism orders and defines the
demands of the masses, of the working classes. And in Peru those
masses are four-fifths indigenous. Thus our socialism must declare
its solidarity with the native people. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s conviction that revolutionary socialism
must of necessity connect with local traditions and conditions that
would very soon bring him into confrontation with the Communist
International. Yet if Mari&#225;tegui insisted on the &#8220;nationalisation&#8221;
&#8211; or rather the adaptation to the real historical experience of
each society &#8211; of Marxism, he remained emphatically
internationalist in his perspectives and relentlessly committed to
building the trade union movement as well as, in the same hyperactive
year, to the setting up of a Peruvian Socialist Party in which, once
again, he would play the leading role. Yet this again would bring him
into conflict with the Comintern and its Latin American representatives.</p>

<p>The period between the beginning of 1929 and his death in April
1930 was overshadowed by the gathering clouds of a disagreement with
the Communist International. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a> Early
in 1929 a Comintern representative visited Peru to invite
Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s group to send delegates to two upcoming conferences &#8211;
the trade union conference in Montevideo and the first congress of
Latin American Communist Parties, to be held in Buenos Aires in May
and June. Mari&#225;tegui himself was unable to travel to either &#8211; the
osteomielitis that dogged his short life was worsening &#8211; but he
briefed the delegation of four who did attend. They included Hugo
Pesce, the young doctor who would later make such an impression on
the young Che Guevara and suggest his first readings of Marx, and
Julio Portocarrero, a young worker from the important Vitarte textile
plant in Lima. Portocarrero was in fact elected to the executive of
the Latin American Trade Union Federation (CSLA). Yet &#8220;to some
extent these meetings represented a showdown between the path being
followed by the Peruvian cell and the official line of the
Comintern&#8221;. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p>Ostensibly the dispute centred on the question of whether or not
the new party would be called &#8220;socialist&#8221; or &#8220;Communist&#8221;. To
the last Mari&#225;tegui was adamant that it should be a socialist party
and resisted the Comintern&#8217;s mounting pressures. There was never
the slightest doubt as to the character of the new party. Its
statutes declared the party&#8217;s affiliation to the Communist
International and its commitment to what it described as &#8220;militant
Leninism&#8221;. Its six-point programme was equally uncompromising. It
argued for the expropriation of the landed estates and their
redistribution to communal organisations or small peasants, with
guarantees of technical and financial support. It called for the
expropriation of all foreign enterprises as well as those belonging
to big Peruvian capital. It demanded an immediate renunciation of the
foreign debt and all imperialist controls and called for the
immediate enactment of the eight-hour working day, as well as the
immediate arming of workers and peasants and the dissolution of the
armed forces and police into the militias. Its sixth point called for
establishment of &#8220;workers, peasants and soldiers municipalities&#8221;
as the organs of power in the new society. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a>
By no stretch of the imagination could this be described as a
reformist programme, still less as lacking a clear revolutionary
impulse. The fact that the Socialist Party did not call for soviets
but for municipalities did not affect the fact that these were
clearly organs of workers&#8217; power similar in character and structure
to the soviets.</p>

<p>If there was so little ideological difference, however, why did
Mari&#225;tegui stick so stubbornly to the &#8220;socialist&#8221; label? In my
view there are several reasons, but they are all tied to his sense
that within the framework of revolutionary Marxism each national
struggle must find its particular articulation of the local and the
international. This was clearly a principle with Mari&#225;tegui. Another
factor is that he had been briefly arrested and jailed at the
beginning of 1928 after the &#8220;discovery&#8221; by President Legu&#237;a of a
&#8220;Communist plot&#8221; to bring down his regime. The reality of the
plot was open to severe doubt, but it provided the pretext for a
repressive response. It may be that Mari&#225;tegui was anxious to avoid
a similar response to the foundation of his party which, he hoped,
would operate legally as far as possible. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a>
Beyond that, however, and of much more fundamental significance, was
his conception of the &#8220;united front&#8221;. The party, as its founding
programme demonstrated clearly, was intended to appeal to workers, to
peasants and indigenous communities, and to the anti-imperialist
sectors of the middle classes.</p>

<p>These latter layers were people to whom Haya de la Torre&#8217;s Apra
had appealed, with some success, in the earlier part of the decade &#8211;
and using some of the same language of &#8220;unity&#8221; as Mari&#225;tegui
had. The pages of the journal <strong>Amauta</strong> were an open forum in
which the supporters of Apra participated freely. But Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s
September 1928 editorial <em>Aniversario y Balance</em> in the journal
marked a clear and definitive break with the Apristas:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><strong>Amauta</strong> now enters its second period, when it no
longer needs to describe itself as a vanguard or left journal. To be
faithful to the revolution, it is enough that it be socialist ... The
very word revolution can lend itself it to ambiguities. Its meaning
needs to be clear. The Latin American revolution can be nothing other
than a stage, a phase of the world revolution. It will be, quite
simply, a socialist revolution. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Haya&#8217;s announcement from Mexico in 1928 of the formation of a
party of his own provoked Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s trenchant response. Up till
then he had regarded Apra as a &#8220;front&#8221; with whom joint work was
still possible, despite a continuing debate and a widening
ideological gulf. The formation of the party, however, precipitated
matters &#8211; for Mari&#225;tegui had made his criticisms of Apra clear in
<strong>Amauta</strong> and elsewhere. Where Apra argued the possibility of a
broad front in alliance with elements of the bourgeoisie,
Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s formulation of the nature of the united front clearly
argued for a unity of the working classes and indigenous communities
led by socialists. Haya de la Torre, by contrast, had always argued
that Peru&#8217;s backwardness meant that leadership must necessarily
fall to middle class elements and the progressive military. While
these arguments could be conducted in the context of broad movement
of activists, Mari&#225;tegui may well have seen the building of a
socialist party as a lesser priority. Now, however, the socialist
vision of the united front which he propounded required a clear
political expression.</p>

<p>Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s consistent and withering critique of Second
International Marxism and reformism provided the political groundwork
for this. His studies of the Peruvian economy, particularly in the
<strong>Seven Essays</strong> explored the consequences of the weakness of the
Peruvian bourgeoisie and its incapacity to carry through an
independent national project. The tasks of economic development and
growth would therefore have to be carried through by a socialist
movement. The concept of the united front and what was clearly an
evolving theory of &#8220;permanent revolution&#8221;, although never couched
in those terms, seemed to suggest at least some awareness of Leon
Trotsky &#8211; and there seems to have been some direct contact between
Mari&#225;tegui and the Trotskyist groups around Naville during 1929.</p>

<p>But this does not seem to be the primary reason for the deep and
growing hostility of the Comintern representatives in Latin America.
Rather, it derived in the first place from Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s resistance
to calling his party Communist. And that in turn seems to have been
interpreted as an indication of a deeper deviation, prioritising race
over class and nation over the international movement. Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s
response was to send with the Peruvian delegates to the May&#8211;June
Congress three key documents addressing those areas of concern: <em>The
Problem of Race in Latin America</em>, <em>The Anti-imperialist
Perspective</em> and <em>Antecedents and Developments of Class
Struggle</em>. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Final days</h4>

<p class="fst">Since his days at <strong>La Raz&#243;n</strong> Mari&#225;tegui had been a tireless
campaigner, organiser, writer and provider, through <strong>Amauta</strong>, of
a platform for socialist debate. As the 1920s drew to a close his
level of activity did not diminish, despite his deteriorating
physical condition and increasing financial difficulties at home. His
Wednesday evenings at home in Calle Washington, Lima, brought the
movement to him &#8211; and the respect he had earned ensured that the
movement did visit. His correspondence &#8211; aside from his hundreds of
articles, reviews and documents &#8211; reveals an activist as engaged
with comrades elsewhere in the continent as with those in Peru. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a>
The amputation of his right leg meant that he would conduct his
activity in this final period from a wheelchair.</p>

<p>His letters from this time to his friend Samuel Glusberg in Buenos
Aires, reveal that the political tensions in Peru were becoming
increasingly difficult to handle and the pressures on him mounting;
just before his death he began to make arrangements to move to Buenos
Aires where he felt the atmosphere would be less oppressive and he
would feel his isolation less. In May&#8211;June 1929, however, he was
unable to travel and it was Pesce and Portocarrero who would once
again present his documents to the Comintern.</p>

<p>But the frosty reception given to the publication of his <strong>Seven
Essays</strong> gave Mari&#225;tegui some sense of the hostility his ideas
might meet at the conference. Codovilla, secretary of the Argentine
Communist Party and the representative of the Comintern at the
conference, argued fiercely that Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s analysis of the
specificity of the Peruvian situation was a concession to
nationalism. Peru, he argued, was more than adequately described by
the general thesis on semi-colonial nations, and by extension could
not therefore be an exception to the general &#8220;class against class
strategy&#8221; laid down by the Third International.</p>

<p>Yet Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s documents did not argue Peruvian
exceptionalism; they discussed the application of revolutionary
strategy in the particular conditions of Peru. Thus his document <em>The
Anti-imperialist Perspective</em> is a fierce condemnation of Apra&#8217;s
anti-imperialism, because &#8220;even if it were able to mobilise the
national bourgeoisie and the peasant masses (a possibility we have
discounted) this would not cancel conflicts of class&#8221;. He uses the
experience of the 1910&#8211;17 Mexican Revolution (about which he wrote
extensively) as a warning. In Mexico the revolutionary movement
represented most clearly by Emiliano Zapata had produced a bourgeois
nationalist regime whose first act had been to attack the peasant
revolutionaries. Mari&#225;tegui argued, &#8220;Our mission is to explain to
the masses how only the socialist revolution can offer real
opposition to the advance of imperialism.&#8221; It is hard at this
distance to understand why this position should have generated such
opposition from Codovilla and others. But in the context of the
Stalinist turn of the Third International towards an ultra-left
policy of treating all non-Communists as counter-revolutionaries,
even &#8220;social fascists&#8221;, it becomes easier to understand.</p>

<p>Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s second paper on the &#8220;problem of race&#8221; met with
equally obstinate resistance. Returning to the arguments that he had
made in <strong>Seven Essays</strong> and elsewhere, Mari&#225;tegui reminded the
conference that four-fifths of Peru&#8217;s workforce were still peasants
or semi-rural workers (for example in the mines) with conflicting
allegiances. By mobilising the solidarity and collective action
embedded in indigenous traditions, he argued, socialism could take
root among the majority of the exploited in Peru. The Comintern line,
by contrast, was to see this as a national question and to argue for
the &#8220;self-determination of the indigenous peoples&#8221;. It was ironic
that Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s insistence on the interlacing of race and class,
and that the situation of the indigenous peoples had to be understood
ultimately in terms of the economy, should have been rejected in the
name of Marxism!</p>

<p>The consequence of the Buenos Aires conference, given the
authority of the Comintern representatives, was that Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s
authority and leadership came under immediate attack. Eudocio
Ravines, a sinister character who had moved from Apra into the
offices of the Third International in Paris, was now sent to Peru to
implement the decisions of the conference and form a Communist Party.
Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s letters to Glusberg reveal a man of failing health
increasingly frustrated by events at home. Ironically, Mari&#225;tegui
welcomed Ravines when he arrived in Peru early in March 1930 and
agreed that he should take over the leadership. A month later
Mari&#225;tegui was dead and the city of Lima stopped all activity for
five minutes in his honour. His funeral was a massive demonstration
of the affection in which he was held.</p>

<p>By May the Peruvian Communist Party had been formed &#8211; on the
basis that Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s project for a united front had been too
broad, admitting intellectuals and petit bourgeois elements. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a>
Within a year a disastrous armed rising in the indigenous highlands
isolated the communities and brought down on them the most severe
repression. By the mid-1930s much of Mari&#225;tegui&#8217;s patient work in
the trade union movement had been undone, and his ideas
systematically misrepresented to the succeeding generation. By then,
of course, the Third International had turned back to many of his
positions &#8211; without acknowledgment, of course.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is appropriate to leave the last word with Gregory Zinoviev:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Mari&#225;tegui has a brilliant mind; he is a true creator.
He does not seem like a Latin American; he does not plagiarise, he
does not copy, he does not parrot what the Europeans say. What he
creates is his own. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In his own time, that originality was his undoing. Today, it is
the reason to rediscover his work.</p>
