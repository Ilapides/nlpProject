<p class="fst"><strong>For Richer, For Poorer. Shaping US-Mexican Integration</strong><br/>
Harry Browne<br/>
<em>Latin American Bureau &#163;7.99</em></p>

<p class="fst">There may still be some people somewhere who believe that the
market can bring benefits. The last and latest attempt to
re-establish the illusion was the signing of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on 1 January this year. Unfortunately for
Clinton, his assurances to Congress that his version of the agreement
would be more socially responsible than earlier drafts were exposed
by 20,000 armed peasants in southern Mexico who showed that it would
bring only hunger and poverty.</p>

<p>NAFTA has only one purpose &#8211; to integrate the world market for
the benefit of powerful capitalist interests. The consequences will
be immediate. Populations expelled from their land will become wage
labourers producing crops for export or will drift to the factories
that are moving from the US or Canada to Mexico because this
disposable army of workers is cheaper and less able to defend its
working conditions.</p>

<p>These new factories will produce goods for a wider market, but
most of them will be beyond the reach of those who produce them. In
the very short term 500,000 jobs will be lost in Mexico. Once the
ruling classes of the so called &#8216;Third World&#8217; tried to set up
their own protected areas of economic activity, now they are rushing
to become part of great international conglomerates.</p>
<p>NAFTA is a model of what free trade and global integration mean.
The British and Mexican ruling classes not only share a common
ideology &#8211; they are competing for resources in exactly the same
way. Each claim that the economy as a whole will benefit from any new
investment. The reality in the long recession of the 1990s is that
some economic sectors will grow, but the benefits will be accumulated
in the heart of a corporation that will seek to spread its
investments across the world for its own profit.</p>

<p>The authors of this book offer plenty of evidence and detailed
statistics to reinforce the point. They underline the dangers and the
brutal consequences of this &#8216;corporate bill of rights&#8217;. At the
heart of their critique is a hope that new international institutions
will arise to oversee and control the international order.</p>

<p>It is a futile hope. GATT and NAFTA are the economic arms of a
system whose military and political expressions, like the UN, have
made it brutally clear on whose behalf they are prepared to act.
Change will come only when power shifts towards the producers. All
the guarantees offered by the Mexican government to the people of
Chiapas were meaningless until they fought back.</p>

<p>The alternative of creating an independent state able to protect
itself from the system has been exposed in Cuba, Nicaragua and Mexico
itself. Such states may offer the opportunity of resistance &#8211; but
they cannot offer an alternative. The sane world the authors of this
book so clearly wish to see can never be created by members of a
capitalist class whose survival depends on the successful
exploitation of workers.</p>

<p>Politically, only the international organisation of workers offers
an alternative future. The great illusion that a global economy will
bring a general improvement is exposed from Chiapas to the sweatshops
of China. The only improvements in the lives of workers have been won
by workers themselves.</p>
