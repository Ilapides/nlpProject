<p class="quoteb">At 4&nbsp;a.m. on Monday the Electoral Commission
announced the results; 4,991,483 (58.25 percent) voted no and
3,576,517 (41.74 percent) voted yes. It was obvious where the votes
had come from, even before the results were announced. You could
measure it by skin colour, what people wore and where they lived. The
majority of well-dressed white people from the wealthier suburbs
angrily voted yes, claiming that Ch&#225;vez has divided Venezuela. The
dark-skinned poor of the hillside shanties reply that Venezuela was
always divided. The difference now is that the people without a voice
can now make themselves heard. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The referendum was certainly not the terrain that Hugo Ch&#225;vez,
Venezuela&#8217;s president, would have chosen as the testing ground to
measure the progress of the Bolivarian revolution. The Venezuelan
right, bitterly hostile to the government of Hugo Ch&#225;vez, had
exploited an important clause in the new constitution of 1999 which
allowed elected politicians, and especially the national president,
to be recalled after serving half of the six-year presidential term.
This required the collection of some 2.3 million signatures &#8211; a
process that had taken months of collection, checking, challenge and
proof. Once the numbers were found, the total voting for the recall
(a yes vote) would need to be greater than the majority who supported
Ch&#225;vez in the presidential elections of 2000.</p>

<p>There were many in the Ch&#225;vez camp who argued that the referendum
was a ploy &#8211; a stratagem particularly unfavourable to the
Venezuelan poor, a majority of whom would not possess the necessary
registration documents to allow them to vote in the peculiarly
bureaucratic Venezuelan system. On 15 August each elector would
present a credential, have a fingerprint taken both manually and
electronically, wait for confirmation and then vote. The enormous
queues that formed at every polling centre from 4&nbsp;a.m. on the
morning of that day were just one more gauntlet thrown down to the
supporters of Ch&#225;vez.</p>

<p>In the event, the arguments for abstention did not convince.
Instead Ch&#225;vez called the referendum the Battle of Santa In&#233;s &#8211; a
reference to a battle fought in 1859 by Ezequiel Zamora, at the head
of a largely peasant army, during a period of civil war. Zamora
pretended to retreat and then surrounded and destroyed the armies of
the ruling class on a terrain more favourable to his soldiers. Ch&#225;vez
presented the referendum of 15 August 2004 in similar terms. While it
appeared to be a political retreat, it would in fact, he said, be the
prelude to an advance in Venezuela&#8217;s developing Bolivarian revolution.</p>

<p>From the United States and all those who had steadfastly supported
the opposition to Ch&#225;vez, the demands and denunciations rained down
relentlessly on the national palace in Caracas. The opposition
accused the government of a failure to observe democratic procedures,
describing Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s rule as a dictatorship, despite the fact that
he had been elected in untainted presidential elections. This was
deeply ironic, of course, given the events of the previous three and
a half years. But Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s answer was to accept the challenge.</p>

<p>Those who saw the referendum as a backward step were right. The
advance of a revolutionary process could and should be measured by
the pace with which power passes directly into the hands of working
people and the degree to which it is the interests of the majority
that increasingly shape the distribution of resources. In that sense,
a referendum drags politics back onto the terrain of formal
democracy, to the matter of institutional arrangements within the
system and away from the deepening control from below whose progress,
or otherwise, is the key issue for revolution.</p>

<p>In that sense too, the referendum was a small victory for the
right. In the event, a high degree of mass mobilisation in the
heartlands of Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s support produced a result which confounded
the opposition and cleared the way for a deepening radicalisation.
The consequences and impact of that result have resonated well beyond
Venezuela, and have important implications for the revolutionary left
internationally &#8211; matters to which we will return in the final
section of this account.</p>

<p>The ferocity of the Venezuelan ruling class assault on the Ch&#225;vez
government &#8211; of which the referendum is simply the latest chapter &#8211;
is not some peculiar feature of Latin American politics. It is worth
remembering that the Chilean coup of 1973 was sustained and supported
by a bourgeoisie which had always proclaimed its devotion to
parliamentary democracy. That same class stood by and applauded
levels of repression which have made the very word Chile a watchword
for state violence. In Venezuela too the procedures of parliamentary
order were obeyed in the letter but not in the spirit. Instead
Venezuelan political life was shaped by manipulation and a corruption
fuelled by the single most important source of Venezuelan wealth &#8211; oil.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Black gold</h4>

<p class="quoteb">Perhaps the most important thing to know about Venezuela
is that it is an oil exporting country, the fifth largest in the
world, with the largest reserves of conventional oil (light and heavy
crude) in the western hemisphere and the largest reserves of
non-conventional oil (extra-heavy crude) in the world. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Oil production in Venezuela began in the early 1920s, during the
brutal dictatorship of Juan Vicente G&#243;mez. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> G&#243;mez was much given
to spectacular and ostentatious public works projects &#8211; a luxury he
could allow himself because oil revenues were constantly rising,
though by the late 1930s that revenue largely flowed into the coffers
of Shell and Standard Oil. In that period oil had come to represent
over 90 percent of the country&#8217;s income (from 1.9 percent in
1920!). Production levels rose again in the 1950s &#8211; between 1958
and 1998 Venezuela&#8217;s total income from oil was over $300 billion.</p>

<p>The global figures conceal peaks and troughs which produced both
economic and political crises, yet throughout the country&#8217;s
dependence on oil revenues became more and more pronounced. In 1960,
for example, Venezuela promoted the formation of OPEC as the
expansion of Middle Eastern oil threatened the high prices of the
early 1950s. At the same time, the Venezuelan Oil Corporation was
created in an attempt to force the foreign corporations who extracted
the oil to pay more to the state. But the first great oil boom had
passed and the military ruler who had overseen it, P&#233;rez Jim&#233;nez,
had fled to Miami with several hundred million dollars safely
ensconced in US banks. Caracas itself was the clearest testimony to
the massive speculation and graft of those years. Its modern centre
of modernist concrete buildings was aesthetically exciting, but
represented the squandering of oil revenues. The shanties clinging to
the hills around the city said all that needed to be said about who
had been the beneficiaries of the boom. While production rose
steadily between 1960 and 1964, it was significant that only 8
million cubic metres were consumed within Venezuela (in 1964) and
nearly 187 million exported. Those who gained from the boom bought
their imported goods and services at a high price &#8211; and the cost of
living rose to the point where it was said that Caracas was a more
expensive city than Chicago &#8211; and had more Cadillacs per head of
population. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p>The expansion took place under the government of R&#243;mulo
Betancourt, whose brief flirtation with Fidel Castro before and
immediately after the Cuban Revolution of 1959 had contributed to his
reputation as a reformer. His promises to raise the levels of income
of all poor Venezuelans, however, very quickly dissolved; under
pressure from a US government anxious to isolate Cuba and protect its
economic interests in Venezuela and the rest of the continent,
Betancourt&#8217;s government countered street demonstrations and the
subsequent occupation of the Central University with repression. At
the same time, the new Venezuelan system was forming on the basis of
an alliance of the parties of the right, the Punto Fijo Pact, which
effectively ensured a system of power sharing between the two major
bourgeois parties &#8211; Betancourt&#8217;s Acci&#243;n Democr&#225;tica (AD) and
the Christian Democrats of COPEI.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The pact, signed in October 1958, created a consensus
system to ensure democratic stability. There would be a common
economic programme and a &#8216;spoils&#8217; system that provided for party
control of appointments to state bodies ... The central role of
private enterprise was written in to the government&#8217;s plans. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The pact held for the next 30 years, until the Caracazo of 1989.
And the key to that economic &#8216;stability&#8217; was the judicious use of
oil revenues. The 2 percent of Venezuelans involved in oil production
were given highly privileged working conditions and protected status.
The oil bureaucrats and all those involved in the trade lived
extraordinarily well (they were the Cadillac owners!). The system
maintained itself after the repression of the early protest movement
through a combination of patronage, repression and occasional
investments in social programmes like education and health &#8211;
particularly during the boom years of the 1970s, when oil prices rose
again with the deepening crisis in the Middle East. Venezuelan oil
revenues quadrupled between 1972 and 1974. Like Betancourt a decade
earlier, Carlos Andr&#233;s P&#233;rez, the newly elected Christian
Democratic president, promised protective economic policies,
diversification and an end to poverty. Part of this &#8216;Great
Venezuela&#8217; programme was the nationalisation of oil in 1976.</p>

<p>The fact that Venezuela&#8217;s oil is run by a nationalised
corporation has created much confusion &#8211; a confusion cynically and
deliberately manipulated for foreign consumption after 2000.The new
Venezuelan State Oil Corporation, PDVSA, inherited an industry
dominated by a series of foreign oil companies. Nationalisation
created 14 Venezuelan companies &#8211; but they were not only the mirror
of the former companies. The new managers were recruited from the old
private industry, maintained a private enterprise attitude to
production and continued their ties and allegiances to their former
masters. PDVSA was, as one observer put it, a &#8216;Trojan horse&#8217;. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a>
The oil workers were locked into the same structures and remained, as
they had before, a highly privileged layer of workers, earning their
salaries in dollars and enjoying all sorts of privileges. Their union
was part of the Venezuelan Workers Congress (CTV) which was an
integral component of the Punto Fijo constitutional arrangements.</p>

<p>PDVSA maintained a kind of autonomy which led analysts to describe
it as &#8216;a state within a state&#8217; through the period of high oil
prices from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. The proportion of its
revenues consumed by expenses grew dramatically, and, despite its
size and economic weight, it paid less to the government per barrel
than did Pemex, the nationalised Mexican oil corporation notorious
for its corruption. In fact, the PDVSA management continued to
operate in conjunction with multinational corporations and the
international oil market, creating its own offshore companies which
absorbed the corporate profits in a series of dubious reselling deals
and service contracts. For example, it purchased a number of foreign
refineries &#8211; but for the most part they were unprofitable and PDVSA
often found itself providing oil at below market prices to keep them
running. &#8216;Currently it costs PDVSA about three times as much to
extract one barrel of oil as it costs other major oil corporations,
such as ExxonMobil, Shell or Chevron Texaco.&#8217; <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p>The 1980s were a time, then, when a small elite made millions from
oil, when capital fled the country to seek profits abroad and when,
despite oil wealth, the Venezuelan GDP fell consistently. This
concentration of wealth and deepening social divide were veiled by
the complicity of politicians, bureaucrats and business who passed
the spoils from hand to hand and controlled a political system which
was little more than a network of patronage and corruption. In the
latter part of the decade falling oil prices produced new crises. The
Venezuelan government turned to the IMF and the institutions of
global capital. This was the era of Thatcher and Reagan, of &#8216;free
market&#8217; economics and the euphemistic &#8216;structural adjustments&#8217;
that withdrew the pitiful subsidies on basic goods, transport and
social provision and demanded a return on investment disguised as aid.</p>

<p>The Venezuelan social pact was based on control by a capitalist
minority of the Venezuelan state in order to protect a virtually
autonomous oil industry which, while ostensibly nationalised, was
becoming more and more integrated into the structures of global oil
production. Within the country the concentration of wealth proceeded
at spectacular pace. Four mass media conglomerates controlled the
bulk of communication. They were popularly known as &#8216;the horsemen
of the apocalypse&#8217;, with the most prominent, Gustavo Cisnero of
Venevisi&#243;n, involved in a dozen other industries and subsidiaries
across South America. At the same time, the pact depended for its
ideological impact on an appearance of redistribution, the
expenditure of some of the crumbs from the financial banquet on
social projects and programmes.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Caracazo: the poor come down from the hills</h4>

<p class="fst">In 1989 Carlos Andr&#233;s P&#233;rez&#8217;s government adopted the full
neo-liberal agenda. By then the slow development of the Venezuelan
economy had already gone into reverse:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The proportion of the population living below the poverty
line soared from 36 percent in 1984 to 66 percent in 1995, and the
number of those living in extreme poverty trebled, rising from 11 to
35 percent. Over the same period, urban unemployment more than
doubled, topping the league for the continent. Yet while the share in
national income of the poorest two-fifths of the population fell from
19.1 percent to 14.7 percent between 1981 and 1997, that of the
richest tenth jumped from 21.8 percent to 32.8 percent. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus oil-rich Venezuela was also the country of the desperately
poor shanty towns clinging to the muddy cliffs around the capital.
For them, P&#233;rez&#8217;s attempt to impose the politics of economic shock
in 1989 was the last straw. They poured down into the streets in what
became known as the Caracazo. P&#233;rez had hinted in his recently
successful presidential campaign that he would not accept the
instructions of the IMF. Once in office he changed his position &#8211;
and his political reforms, including direct election of many mayors
and state governors, did nothing to persuade the mass of Venezuelans
of his good intentions. And their scepticism was well founded.</p>

<p>In late February a rise in the price of petrol, followed by
increased fares on public transport, produced protests and
occupations. It began with a student bus boycott. It spread like a
forest fire throughout the country &#8211; but it was most powerful in
Caracas. P&#233;rez&#8217;s response was swift. His so-called <em>Plan Avila</em>
prepared an overwhelming military response. Troops returned from the
provinces. Next day the shooting began. The official figures for the
dead were around 100. Although the true number of victims remains
uncertain, it is unlikely that fewer than 2,000 were killed in the
government&#8217;s violent response. More significant still, however, was
where the dead were discovered &#8211; Petare, 23 de enero, the
ramshackle settlements of the urban poor. They, after all, were the
most vulnerable of the intended victims of the new economics.</p>

<p>The Caracazo, in some ways, should not be seen as a single event,
but rather as the beginning of continuous process of popular
resistance. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> From then on, as L&#243;pez-Maya argues, demonstrations,
protests and street actions became a regular feature of Venezuelan
public life. 1989 also marked a crossroads in the history of
Venezuela&#8217;s ruling class &#8211; for the crisis that began then
continued and deepened through the 1990s. The old ruling class, in
some senses, went to war in those late February days against the
working class and the poor of Venezuela. As the crisis developed, the
wealthy elite grew richer, the executives of PDVSA feathered their
offshore nests with a greater and greater sense of urgency &#8211; and
the situation of the poor grew more and more desperate.</p>

<p>In many ways, the failed military coup led by Hugo Ch&#225;vez in 1992
and the process that it initiated should also be seen as a slow
unfolding of the political implications of the Caracazo. Municipal
elections late in 1989 had given a new prominence to the MAS
(Movement towards Socialism), a split from the Venezuelan Communist
Party. MAS, while radical in its rhetoric, was always an electoral
organisation and its leader, Teodoro Petkoff, was careful to distance
himself from the insurrectionary implications of the mass
mobilisations that began in 1989. The defeat of the guerrilla
movements in the mid-1960s had largely removed the armed alternative
from the political scenario, although Venezuela&#8217;s best known
guerrilla leader, Douglas Bravo, continued (and continues) to have a
significant role. But MAS and organisations like it were the
beneficiaries of a deep and enduring rejection of the traditional
adherents to the pact of Punto Fijo, and enjoyed much support among
some of those who had participated in the Caracazo. MAS&#8217;s political
rival, Causa R, also an earlier split from the Communist Party,
identified more clearly with the street. And it was to those
demonstrators that Hugo Ch&#225;vez was to make his most direct appeal.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Enter Hugo Ch&#225;vez <small><a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></small></h4>

<p class="fst">Hugo Ch&#225;vez erupted onto the international political scene on 4
February 1992 when he led an attempted coup which was very rapidly
suppressed. Yet it had enjoyed the vocal support of most of
Venezuela&#8217;s urban poor. They, after all, were still living through
the neo-liberal economic strategies imposed by P&#233;rez, and observing
with mounting rage the trading in lucrative jobs and the overt
corruption of a bankrupt political arrangement.</p>

<p>Ch&#225;vez was born in 1954 into a lower middle class family &#8211; his
parents were both teachers. There were some notables in his family
line &#8211; his great great grandfather had fought with Zamora, the
strategist of Santa In&#233;s! The next generation produced the legendary
Maisanta, who had famously resisted the dictatorship of G&#243;mez.
Enlisting in 1971, Ch&#225;vez rose rapidly in the ranks of the military.
By the early 1980s he was a popular and charismatic lecturer at the
Caracas Military Academy. But he saw himself very differently from
the officer class that had benefited from and replicated the cronyism
and graft that characterised the state as a whole. Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s
conception of the role of the military had its reference point in the
military reformists like Presidents Torrijos in Panama and Velasco in
Peru (which he visited in 1974), both of whom had initiated social
reforms after taking power by military coup. They were nationalists
who saw the creation of a strong national state as a prerequisite for
economic and social development. But they also saw themselves as very
separate from political traditions based on mass action. The idea of
reform from above merged with the command model of the structures of
the military. In both these cases the conquest of the state followed
a failed process of political reform, often betrayed by politicians
who, at the level of rhetoric at least, proclaimed a commitment to
social justice and democracy.</p>

<p>In the mid-1970s Ch&#225;vez was sent to help the suppression of a
guerrilla group. In his own words, he felt growing sympathy for the
guerrillas and gathered around him a small group of officers who
wanted to discuss the possibility of radical transformations, an end
to graft and a programme of national development. The group of
dissidents called themselves the Bolivarian Revolutionary Movement
(MRB 2000), to commemorate the leader of the 19th century Latin
American liberation movement, Sim&#243;n Bol&#237;var. It was at that time
that Ch&#225;vez made contact with Douglas Bravo and with the dissenting
communists of Causa R.</p>

<p>Ch&#225;vez summed up the ideology of the Bolivarian movement in a
lengthy interview he gave in 1996:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Bolivarian movement was born in the barracks 15 years
ago when a group of soldiers came to the conclusion that the enemy
was not communism, but imperialism. For many years we worked
carefully and gradually to develop a nationalist, patriotic movement
with one hand in the barracks and the other in the street ... The
current political model is mortally wounded and no viable alternative
can exist without breaking the bourgeois, neo-liberal system that has
operated in Venezuela since 1945. In our model of democracy ... there
has to be direct democracy, people&#8217;s government with popular
assemblies and congresses where the people retain the right to
remove, nominate, sanction and recall their elected delegates. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Even in this short extract there are signs that seem to point in
several different directions. For socialists there is a promise of
direct democracy. For nationalists, there is the assertion of a
patriotic anti-imperialism. But the heart of the matter is in the
specific reference to the collapse of the Venezuelan political system.</p>

<p>The Bolivarian circle drew together a number of currents which
shared Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s disgust with corruption and the abuse of national
resources. Yet it seems clear that the Caracazo caught Ch&#225;vez by
surprise &#8211; at least in the astonishingly rapid spread of popular
protest and the ferocity of the state&#8217;s response. More tellingly,
the traditional political organisations benefited from the growing
political dissidence, yet &#8211; at least in the case of MAS &#8211; seemed
willing to compromise with elements of the very system they denounced.</p>

<p>Late in 1991 Ch&#225;vez informed his political allies of the imminent
coup and called for support. When the coup attempt was launched in
February 1992, thousands of troops joined the call issued by Ch&#225;vez,
his close friend and later political opponent Francisco Arias, and
the Bolivarian movement. The organised civilian support did not
materialise, although the <em>ranchos</em> (as the poor marginal
communities were called) were vocally behind him. After fierce
fighting and a number of deaths, the coup was defeated. Curiously,
P&#233;rez allowed Ch&#225;vez a minute to call on his supporters to
surrender. Instead Ch&#225;vez used his minute to present his case, and
to make an indelible mark on Venezuelan society. The carnival
processions that year boasted lots of youngsters wearing Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s
characteristic red beret. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p>Ch&#225;vez spent the next two years in jail &#8211; but outside the
prison the crisis in Venezuela was intensifying. In 1993 an
over-confident P&#233;rez was finally impeached for fraud and corruption.
The Venezuelan Oil Corporation, meanwhile, signed a new contract for
the Christopher Columbus Natural Gas Project with a consortium of
multinational corporations &#8211; and conceded two thirds of the
ownership of the project to them. The administrative costs were
escalating at a dramatic rate, so that little over a third of
Venezuelan oil revenues found their way into the national economy.
Those administrative costs, of course, concealed the export of
capital and an effective transference of funds and assets to
interests outside Venezuela, many of them run in part or in whole by
PDVSA executives. Poverty was increasing and unemployment rising inexorably.</p>

<p>The 1993 presidential elections brought to power Rafael Caldera,
an elderly politician with a relatively unsullied reputation. His
government, however, &#8216;lurched from one crisis to the next; a
banking collapse led to a state takeover of the banking system at a
cost of $8.5 billion or 75 percent of the national budget for 1994&#8217;.
<a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a> He turned to the IMF in both 1994 and 1996 &#8211; its loans carried
the usual conditions. Petkoff, as economics minister, imposed the conditions.</p>

<p>In the 1993 election Causa R made considerable gains. But within
months it was seeking alliances and coalitions with the very parties
that had run the old system. Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s call from jail for an active
abstention had convinced some 40 percent of the electorate.
Subsequent events must have convinced many more. By 1995 Causa R&#8217;s
support had collapsed &#8211; it split into two warring factions, one of
which approached the 1998 presidential elections in support of the
reactionary ex-beauty queen Irene S&#225;ez. Her candidacy was in many
ways evidence of the bankruptcy of Venezuelan politics. The other
faction formed Patria Para Todos and entered a long period of debate
over who to support in the coming elections. In the end a narrow
majority opted to support the candidacy of Hugo Ch&#225;vez and his Fifth
Republic Movement (MVR). The forces that eventually gathered around
Ch&#225;vez were testimony to the breadth and to the ambiguity of his
patriotic programme.</p>

<p>On 8 December 1998 Ch&#225;vez emerged as the elected president of
Venezuela with some 56 percent of the vote. The right was stunned,
Washington deeply disturbed. His election victory reflected a series
of different factors. The Venezuelan bourgeoisie had been unable to
come up with a credible presidential candidate other than the beauty
queen and the right wing economist Henrique Salas, neither of whom
could make any credible claim to represent the interests of the
majority of Venezuelans. They were the inheritors and representatives
of a political system that was bankrupt and exposed &#8211; a system
whose public face was the arrogant fraudster Carlos Andr&#233;s P&#233;rez.
Much of the left, for its part, had colluded with that very same
system as the crisis of the 1990s deepened, and had experienced
popular rejection as a result. Douglas Bravo, who knew Ch&#225;vez well
and was certainly influential in his political development, was now
largely involved with direct action movements on the land.</p>

<p>There was both a power vacuum, and the continuing crisis among the
organisations of the left &#8211; the ongoing echo of the post-1989
crisis of Stalinism &#8211; made them incapable of connecting with, let
alone organising or leading, the mass protest movement. Ch&#225;vez
filled that vacuum with a political ideology which was nationalist
and anti-imperialist, and identified with the excluded and
marginalised sectors of Venezuelan society. His rejection of
neo-liberal economic strategies and his relentless attacks on the
corruption of the old system resonated with the deeply impoverished
majority. And his scepticism about political parties, of the left as
much as of the right, seemed to fit with the experience, and the
disillusionment, of that same majority.</p>

<p>His persona was a subtle expression of his politics. He clearly
did not belong to the white-skinned, soft-featured elite of
Venezuela. Irene S&#225;ez, the blonde Miss Venezuela, expressed that
bourgeoisie&#8217;s ideals perfectly &#8211; and it was ironic that when she
allowed her hair to return to its normal brown colour in the course
of the election campaign she began to lose favour. Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s dark
skin, chiselled features and street-wise way of speaking were
powerful signs in a country where class and ethnicity had always been
so closely interwoven. And his scepticism about traditional political
organisation &#8211; and not only the discredited bourgeois parties &#8211;
also found an echo with his base of support among the poor and the
marginalised. Bolivarismo was, by its nature, a studiedly ambiguous
idea, a mix of nationalism, populism, the language of radical
democracy and popular wisdom. And while the historical reference to
Bol&#237;var connects directly with an anti-imperialist perspective, it
is also an ideology of authoritarian leadership. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p>The essential question to be asked is not to interrogate the
leader&#8217;s face for signs of sincerity or his words for internal
contradictions, but rather to ask who, in this vision of political
change, is the protagonist of the process, the engine of
transformation and the central actor in the building of a new
society. For Marxists, the revolution is the act of a whole class, in
all its diversity and difference &#8211; the working class acting to
achieve its own liberation. In the ideology of Bolivarismo/Chavismo,
who occupies that role?</p>

<p>It is my view that the question is not easily answered &#8211;
precisely because there are unresolved contradictions at the heart of
Chavismo . In the 1996 interview quoted earlier, for example, Ch&#225;vez
commits himself to advanced forms of rank and file democracy. Yet, as
will become clear, the organisational expressions of the Bolivarian
revolution in power were very far from the &#8216;popular assemblies and
congresses&#8217; he alluded to there.</p>

<p>In the end, of course, it would be paradoxical to argue that the
emergence of organs of workers&#8217; democracy should depend on a
decision by Ch&#225;vez &#8211; they should, by their very nature, arise in
the context of class struggle. Yet the influence and authority of
Ch&#225;vez are beyond question &#8211; and therefore the exercise of that
influence is a material factor, especially in the context of an
absence of left alternatives rooted in the movement and capable of
challenging and questioning the president. His weekly intimate
conversations with the Venezuelan people &#8211; his <em>Al&#243; Presidente</em>
programmes &#8211; are brilliant exercises in political communication,
but they are monologues.</p>

<p>These are not abstract questions. In the concrete circumstances of
escalating class confrontation, they are strategic questions that
shape and direct the interventions and actions of the mass
movement.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Bolivarian revolution</h4>

<p class="fst">In the year of Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s election 67 percent of the population
of the country earned less than $2 a day, and 36 percent less than
$1.50. Within two months he had proposed a referendum for a
constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a> Of the 131
delegates to the assembly 125 were Ch&#225;vez supporters &#8211; among the
losing candidates was the ever-present Carlos Andr&#233;s P&#233;rez. The new
document was approved in December 1999. Its main provisions were
directed at rebuilding the discredited political system and making
elected officials accountable and open to recall (the clause that was
used against Ch&#225;vez in 2004). It set out the obligation of the mass
media to be &#8216;truthful&#8217;, which evoked howls of protest before such
&#8216;unjustified intervention in the democratic press&#8217; from the
monopoly owner of the Venevisi&#243;n Corporation and his ilk. The church
turned its large guns against the promise to raise subsidies to state
schools at the church&#8217;s expense and the threat to introduce
abortion rights. But it was the plans for the reorganisation of the
oil industry that provoked the most vehement hostility. The new
constitution introduced a right to health and an entitlement to land
for landless peasants, as well as basic trade union rights.
Unsurprisingly it was ratified by 71 percent of those who voted in
the referendum of December.</p>

<p>The numbers voting might certainly have been higher (56 percent of
electors did not vote) had the skies not opened and visited upon
Venezuela days of torrential rain. The precarious and fragile houses
around Caracas began to fall into the gigantic mudslides the rain
produced. Some on the right were cynical enough to claim this as the
wrath of god as the second flood claimed somewhere between 30,000 and
50,000 lives. It certainly set back Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s economic and social
programmes, as unemployment and poverty figures continued to rise
through the first year of his presidency.</p>

<p>The level of popular support for Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s project was beyond
question &#8211; as was the growing hostility of the Venezuelan
bourgeoisie and its allies in Washington. Yet there was some unease
even among Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s allies about the character of his organisation:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The MRB2000 itself, founded by Ch&#225;vez in the 1980s, had
a very small group of members; and the MVR, founded just to
participate in the 1998 presidential elections, is an electoral party
that grew like an avalanche bringing with it many opportunists who
knew that they would be elected only if associated with Ch&#225;vez. Nor
does the country have any strong social movement: neither the
neighbourhood popular movement nor the trade union movement have been
able to become autonomous ... <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">There was no sense that the MVR or the Bolivarian movement existed
in any real sense as a grassroots organisation. The lists of
candidates for the 1998 elections, and indeed for subsequent
elections in 2000, included a wide range of individuals from a
spectrum of organisations, not all of whom had a proven record of
support for mass struggles. The core of Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s organisation was
clearly the military group he had formed in the academy who now
occupied most of the key posts in and around government. As McCaughan
puts it, &#8216;It appeared that individual loyalty rather than
individual merit was the key factor in distributing posts&#8217;. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a>
Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s partners in the electoral coalition of 1998 &#8211; including
MAS and the Communist Party &#8211; now grew impatient with his
unwillingness to distribute power. The distrust of political
organisation ran deeper, perhaps, than any of his erstwhile partners
realised. Certainly Ch&#225;vez was happy to deploy the mass support he
enjoyed &#8211; but at this stage there was no evidence of any commitment
to converting that support into the forms of popular democracy he
repeatedly referred to in his speeches and articles.</p>

<p>The bourgeois opposition had by now renounced its attempts to
court the new president and had begun to form an organised
opposition. It campaigned against the scheduled presidential
elections of May 2000, on the grounds of flaws in the electoral
machinery, and succeeded in postponing them until July. Nonetheless,
Ch&#225;vez won again &#8211; with 59 percent and a clear congressional
majority.</p>

<p>He now moved to pass the laws which would allow him to set in
motion his planned changes to the economy and the political system &#8211;
legislation which was finally passed in November 2001. This was the
Rubicon that the bourgeoisie could not allow the new government to
cross &#8211; and it began to put into effect its plan to undermine the
Bolivarian project.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Echoes beyond the frontier</h4>

<p class="fst">As events unfolded in Venezuela they resonated well beyond the
national frontiers. The strategies of global capital within Latin
America were producing resistance on many fronts. In 2000 the little
known but hugely significant resistance of indigenous organisations
and trade unions overthrew the deeply unpopular government of Mahuad
in Ecuador when he attempted to impose the neo-liberal agenda by
dollarising the national economy. The Zapatista resistance in Mexico
had emerged in 1994, coinciding with the creation of the North
American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) and signalling the emergence of a
continent-wide resistance to neo-liberalism which would find
expression in the World Social Forums in Porto Alegre, Brazil. In
Brazil the aggressive neo-liberal strategies of Fernando Henrique
Cardoso were countered by a combative Landless Workers Movement
(MST), and the PT (Workers Party) of Lula, while not yet occupying
the presidency, had created a network of local and regional
structures which attempted to oppose or at least to moderate the
impact of those strategies. The so called Argentinazo uprising in
December 2001 <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a> came just a month after the passing of Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s
enabling laws. Mass struggles were beginning to occupy the political
terrain &#8211; and no electoral alternative that sought mass support
could afford to ignore the depredations that global capital was
inflicting on the mass of workers. Venezuela was not, as Harnecker
would have it, &#8216;<em>sui generis</em>&#8217;. Its experience was typical
of a Latin America facing the impact of globalisation everywhere.</p>

<p>The Venezuelan bourgeoisie&#8217;s response to the November laws was
predictable from the point of view of its own class interests. There
were two particular elements which provoked its fury and struck at
the very heart of its class interests. The first was a new oil law
which set limits on the involvement of foreign companies and doubled
the royalties to be paid to the state; the increased oil income since
1999 had gone to raise spending on education (from 3.3 percent to 5.2
percent of GDP) and health (from 1.1 percent to 1.4 percent). The
second spark was Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s <em>Ley de Tierras</em>, which limited the
size of landholdings and permitted the redistribution of certain
lands, particularly underused areas, to landless peasants. Bearing in
mind that around 13 percent of Venezuela&#8217;s people live in rural
areas and that agriculture&#8217;s share of GDP stood in 1999 at around 6
percent, the purpose of this reform was fundamentally to raise
agricultural production and productivity.</p>

<p>Whatever the limitations of these reforms, the Venezuelan ruling
class responded with its first general strike against the government.
The strike was led by the management of PDVSA, the employers&#8217;
federation Fedec&#225;maras and &#8211; confusingly &#8211; the Venezuelan
Workers Congress (CTV). The employers, especially in their
communications with the outside world, consciously exploited this
paradox. The reality, of course, is that CTV was a notoriously
corrupt organisation whose leadership was integrated into the system
of graft and cronyism that characterised the old regime. Its reason
for resisting the land redistribution, for example, was that &#8216;it
would impinge on employers ability to do business&#8217;. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a></p>

<p>The one-day strike of the opposition, in December, was a
muscle-flexing exercise, but it pointed to the shape of things to
come. Ch&#225;vez responded on 17 December with a call for the formation
of the <em>C&#237;rculos Bolivarianos</em>, the Bolivarian Circles &#8211; some
one and a half million people signed up for them in the months that
followed. The right wing opposition, now embarking on a permanent
campaign of threats and mobilisations, argued that the circles were
preparing for armed insurrection. Ch&#225;vez, by contrast, saw them as
community organisations and instruments of consciousness. Put
differently, they were organs whose primary purpose was to mobilise
support for his government. What was very clear, however, was that
they would remain tightly controlled from above in a regime that
remained highly centralised in Ch&#225;vez himself. There was no question
that they might represent the development of a power from below
preparing to take on the ruling class offensive directly.</p>

<p>In January 2002 a massive right wing demonstration confronted
Chavista counter-demonstrations and tensions rose. In February a
senior military officer called on Ch&#225;vez to resign, a timely
reminder that the army was as divided along class lines as was the
society as a whole. In March the CTV union federation signed an
agreement with the employers&#8217; organisation, a clear response to
Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s decision to remove a number of PDVSA executives. MAS and
a number of deputies belonging to Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s MVR party went over to
the opposition. The mass media, meanwhile, were deliberately and
daily raising the level of tension. The cacerolazos, banging empty
pots as an act of protest, rang out almost daily in the middle class
districts. Ch&#225;vez responded by new appeals to the population to look
out for speculation and to lengthy TV celebrations of his defence of
the right of free speech &#8211; which had benefited the bourgeoisie
above all.</p>

<p>The opposition launched a general strike on 9 and 10 April.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The coup that failed &#8211; a victory for the masses</h4>

<p class="fst">The bourgeoisie had drawn up its battle lines. The question was,
how would the Venezuelan working class, the poor and the peasantry
organise their mass response to this assault by the ruling class?
What organs of struggle and direct action would emerge in the course
of struggle?</p>

<p>The masses were clearly on the alert &#8211; but there was no
alternative political impulse to drive or shape their response to
events other than the instructions coming from the Miraflores
presidential palace. And its incumbent saw himself, and the small
circle of trusted military men around him as the actors in the
situation with the masses in the role of support. On 11 April the
strike was declared indefinite. The calls came for Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s
resignation, and were backed by a number of senior military men. Some
200,000 marched on the presidential palace but were met at the Puente
Llaguna bridge over the road by a pro-Ch&#225;vez demonstration. The
shots that rang out at 2.30 that afternoon echoed around the world,
as the opposition accused Ch&#225;vez supporters of opening fire.
Subsequent film footage leaves little doubt that opposition snipers
were responsible &#8211; equally it shows that the city police under the
control of Caracas&#8217;s mayor, a public opponent of Ch&#225;vez, stood
back. In the palace, Ch&#225;vez waited &#8211; until it became clear that
the army was split. When opposition members entered the palace and
demanded his resignation he agreed to leave under arrest &#8211; though
he insisted that he never resigned. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p>Ch&#225;vez was taken to the island military base of La Orchila and
detained there, accused of responsibility for the deaths of civilians
on the Caracas demonstration. In the National Palace the opposition
leaders celebrated the easy removal of Ch&#225;vez with champagne. Pedro
Carmona, head of the business organisation Fedec&#225;maras, took out the
presidential sash that he had had made for himself some weeks
previously. Carlos Ortega, head of the Venezuelan Trade Union
Federation (CTV), was there together with several of the oil company
executives. Cisneros, the owner of Venevisi&#243;n, was certainly
celebrating the victory of his sustained campaign of vilification.
The European Union and Washington rushed to celebrate the restoration
of the previous order! Carlos Andr&#233;s P&#233;rez, the <em>eminence grise</em>
of the old Venezuela, must have looked on with satisfaction from his
home in Miami &#8211; he had met Carmona just a couple of weeks earlier,
no doubt to organise his own triumphant return.</p>

<p>But how quickly a tide can turn!</p>

<p>The Irish television team accidentally holed up in the Miraflores
palace pointed their lenses through the windows onto the avenue
outside. Like the excessively cheerful new occupants of the palace,
the journalists registered a curious phenomenon. The city centre was
slowly filling up with people. But these were not the usual users of
these streets. The baseball caps and T-shirts, but above all the
faces of these people, were revealing. These were the residents of
the poor districts, of the precarious shanties at the city&#8217;s edge.
Slowly, with no apparent urgency, they were occupying the avenues
around the palace. Inside the elation was turning into a mounting concern.</p>

<p>The presidential guard remained loyal to Ch&#225;vez and refused to
acknowledge the new occupants of the presidential palace. As the
crowd swelled, grew more and more vocal, and refused to move, Ch&#225;vez
was preparing his return. Military officers who supported him
arranged for the helicopter to bring him back. He had been out of
Caracas for a little under 48 hours.</p>

<p>The Irish television documentary shows this moment of return. What
had happened in those days was extraordinary. The sheer weight and
determination of the mass movement had tipped the political balance
against the bourgeois plotters &#8211; who had fled. More than that, the
initiative had passed, for those two days at least, from Ch&#225;vez to
the mass movement in the street. There was a new power in Venezuela
now &#8211; the very mass democracy that Ch&#225;vez had seen in embryo in
the Caracazo, that he had promised to rebuild and develop in his 1996
interview and in countless speeches since. That power was no longer
an abstraction, but a material reality. The collective protagonist of
revolution was waiting in Caracas&#8217;s grand avenues.</p>

<p>Hugo Ch&#225;vez thanked them &#8211; and asked them to return to their
homes. Of course they were probably weary and quite ready to take a
rest; but that is not the point. What Ch&#225;vez did at that moment was
demobilise his supporters and take back into his own hands the
leadership of the movement. In the days that followed an
investigation into the involvement of the military in the coup began
&#8211; yet the courts absolved all those who were involved. Despite the
active leadership given by the private mass media in the events of 11
and 12 April, there was no attempt to control or contain their
activities. On the contrary, they become more vocal and more active
in opposing Ch&#225;vez in the months after the coup. Those responsible
for the murders at Puente Llaguno were not brought to justice &#8211; and
while Carmona fled the country, others implicated in the events were
left virtually untouched. Worst of all, the executives of the PDVSA
were restored to their posts.</p>

<p>The events identified the opposition and showed how far they were
willing to go:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The coup was defeated but Ch&#225;vez chose not to move
against all but the most visible leaders of the conspiracy. The
absence of sanctions against the opposition was interpreted as a sign
of government weakness. The Venezuelan Supreme Court subsequently
overruled a magistrate&#8217;s order to try four senior army officers
implicated in the coup, ruling that the events of 11-A did not
constitute a <em>coup d&#8217;etat</em> but a &#8216;power vacuum&#8217;. Ch&#225;vez
disagreed with the ruling but made no attempt to interfere with the
verdict. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></p>

<p class="fst">By August the opposition was regrouping, its confidence restored
by Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s obvious decision not to press home his advantage.
Demonstrations that months were accompanied by cocksure declarations
from coup leaders that Ch&#225;vez would soon fall.</p>

<p>It is hard not to be reminded of another, earlier sequence of
events with so many parallels with the current situation in
Venezuela. In Chile in 1973 the bourgeoisie was quite openly
discussing the ways it might find to overthrow the government of
Salvador Allende, elected president of the Popular Unity coalition.
The debate then was between crippling the economy and assaulting
power directly. In Venezuela exactly the same debate was taking
place. In October dissident military officers set up a &#8216;rebel camp&#8217;
in one of the wealthiest parts of central Caracas &#8211; so called civil
organisations were advocating a refusal to pay income tax. Chile&#8217;s
lessons for the future were painfully clear &#8211; and would become
painfully relevant as the Venezuelan situation evolved. Faced with a
challenge to its hegemonic power, faced with the prospect of working
masses seizing the initiative, as they had done in April, the ruling
class would mobilise all its power to defeat such a fundamental
challenge. Naturally, it would accept the gifts of democratic
observance which Ch&#225;vez offered &#8211; the defence of its right to
&#8216;free speech&#8217;, the acceptance of the independence of courts
dominated by figures sympathetic to it, the processing of change
through parliamentary legislation. But equally it would be willing,
like every ruling class under threat, to go beyond the institutional
arrangements in defence of its class interests.</p>

<p>Ch&#225;vez had had a choice in April &#8211; to seek to compromise with
the coup-makers, or to radicalise the process by placing power
increasingly in the hands of the popular organisations. He chose the
first. But this only encouraged the right. The media spoke daily of
imminent chaos. Washington fuelled the rumours of disaster. Foreign
capital fled the Venezuelan economy. Yet land was being distributed
and legislation to enable shanty dwellers to earn title to their
plots was being implemented. Attendance at secondary schools in
particular expanded as a new generation of young teachers were joined
by Cuban teachers. Medical services in the poor areas were also
dramatically approved by the arrival of Cuban doctors.</p>

<p>While these measures maintained Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s social base, they
served to fuel the hysteria of the middle classes &#8211; what better to
feed ruling class paranoia than Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s evident friendship with
Fidel Castro, for example. Yet Ch&#225;vez still did not acknowledge the
option of deepening and accelerating the process of social change by
a devolution of power from the presidential palace to the mass
organisations at the base.</p>

<p>As the time for the implementation of the new legislation on oil
(January 2003) approached, the opposition sharpened its economic
weapons and prepared its second frontal assault on the Ch&#225;vez
government. In December 2002 it launched another general strike.
McGaughan describes its day to day progress. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a> Oil production
ground rapidly to a halt, businesses closed their doors, schools
locked their doors, and the cooking gas so essential to the poor
districts began to run out. The mass media, under the direction of
Cisneros and the other three horsemen of the apocalypse, suspended
normal programming and instead broadcast virtually continuous &#8216;news
bulletins&#8217; describing the success of the strike and painting a
picture of chaos and violence. It was cynical and deliberate in the
extreme. The oppositional officers in the armed forces were more
cautious this time than they had been in April &#8211; the dissident
encampment was maintained but most of its sympathisers kept their counsel.</p>

<p>By February the strike was over &#8211; defeated above all by the
mobilisation of the people who kept supplies going, particularly of
gas, and countered the propaganda of the rich with their own <em>Radio
Bemba</em>, the powerful weapon of street communication. Yet there was
no doubt of the tremendous damage the strike had done &#8211; Wilpert
estimates the cost at $6 billion. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a> Yet the Venezuelan bourgeoisie
had once again been defeated by the action of the masses. The
parallels with Chile are potent. In October 1972 and August 1973 the
bosses&#8217; strikes in that country were defeated by the mass
mobilisations of the working class, who kept the transport running,
the factories producing and the food circulating. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a> The aftermath
of that experience, of course, was the terrible repression that
followed the overthrow and murder of Allende and the ascent to power
of Augusto Pinochet. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p>I am not suggesting any obvious or direct parallels, but the
echoes are unmistakable. In the wake of the defeated bosses&#8217;
strikes in Chile, the bourgeoisie began to speak openly of
overthrowing Allende. On the left, meanwhile, the debate turned on
the question of what was meant by &#8216;<em>poder popular</em>&#8217; &#8211;
popular power. Could Allende maintain the middle ground he coveted
and act to balance the interests of the opposing classes? Could
socialism, the transfer of power from one class to another, actually
be achieved within the framework of a bourgeois democracy, even if
the left were in government? We now know the answers to those
questions about Chile.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Having survived a second time</h4>

<p class="fst">Other important events had taken place in Latin America while the
Venezuelan bourgeoisie was attempting to bring Ch&#225;vez down. In
December 2002 Lula had finally been elected to the presidency of
Brazil. And in Ecuador, Lucio Guti&#233;rrez, closely associated with the
mass risings against the government in the previous two years, was
also elected to the presidency with a promise to oppose neo-liberal
economic strategies. In early 2003 the talk at the Porto Alegre World
Social Forum was an optimistic appraisal of the new anti-imperialist
bloc represented by these three newly elected presidents. Ch&#225;vez
spoke to the state parliament in Porto Alegre and was rapturously received.</p>

<p>Many on the left felt at that juncture that the revival of a
project for national self-determination and economic independence was
now firmly on the historical agenda. It involved the goal of national
development and modernisation within a framework of a &#8216;controlled
capitalism&#8217; &#8211; as if the nation-state had suddenly discovered a
new and unexpected capacity to defy the dictates of global capital.
Ch&#225;vez encouraged such ideas when he praised Lula&#8217;s example at the
inauguration of Kirchner as the president of Argentina in the spring
of 2003. At this stage of the struggle such an approach was an
alternative to the elaboration of coordinated international
strategies of mass resistance.</p>

<p>The euphoria was short-lived. Lula&#8217;s pre-election pledges to the
IMF, and the political compromises enshrined in key appointments in
his government were the signal that should have given warning. Within
weeks Lula was giving assurances to the global financial institutions
while simultaneously refusing to allow long-delayed wage rises to
civil servants and the protection of their pensions. The
disillusionment was rapid and profound. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a> The same was true of
Guti&#233;rrez, who yielded even more rapidly to the pressures of the IMF.</p>

<p>The Venezuelan opposition did not move to armed opposition &#8211;
though there were, and remain, all sorts of vague threats in the air.
Instead it moved to collect signatures for a recall referendum, as
allowed by the constitution of 2000. In a sense it was a defeat for
the right. Yet it also represented a pressure to move back from the
terrain of class confrontation into an institutional setting where
its international allies could also be mobilised against Ch&#225;vez. In
the event, many of the signatures proved fraudulent and it would take
another year before the requisite numbers of legitimate names were gathered.</p>

<p>In the interim the economy began to recover as oil production
began again and a number of the social programmes long promised by
Ch&#225;vez began to be implemented &#8211; the distribution of land, the
regularisation of urban settlement, the education plan and the
establishment of a health system for the excluded and the marginal.
Oil revenues are now used for social programmes, much to the disgust
of the old bourgeoisie. Organisationally the implementation of many
of these programmes has been carried out through the Bolivarian
Circles, or their equivalent, in the communities. At first sight,
these may be seen as the expression of that vision of popular power
Ch&#225;vez himself articulated two years before his election to the
presidency. And yet they served not to decentralise power but to
concentrate it ever more firmly in Ch&#225;vez and his immediate circle:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There is no doubt that the urban land titles, agrarian
reform, literacy programme, state-run basic food distribution
networks, Saraos, urban gardens and other projects all contribute
towards empowering the dispossessed majority. But the vast majority
of Venezuelan citizens remain bystanders to the political process,
waiting for results to be delivered ... <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It may be argued, of course, that change and development are being
delivered, and that increased oil revenues will only accelerate the
process. The problem, of course, is that none of this takes place in
a vacuum. The Venezuelan bourgeoisie has demonstrated amply its
hostility to redistribution or to state control of the economy, let
alone any move towards a genuine democracy from below. History
provides compelling evidence of the readiness of even the most
ostensibly democratic ruling classes to employ any means to safeguard
their power.</p>

<p>There is a profound difference between community organisations
whose purpose is the implementation of policy from above, and those
which both decide and enact decisions rising from below. That
alternative form of organisation will be based on the collective
power of the working class exercised and discovered in the course of
the struggle. While the language of Ch&#225;vez and those around him has
placed notions of &#8216;the people&#8217; at its heart, what has evolved in
the last four years in Venezuela is not a battle between the nation
and those outside it, nor yet between just and unjust or democrats
and others. In 2002, whether in April or December, it was clear to
everyone involved that this was class struggle. Democracy and justice
were important issues, of course, but they were driving forces within
the camp of the working class &#8211; and mere options for the bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>When the organisations that lead the struggle identify their own
purposes in class terms, then revolution &#8211; the transfer of power
from one class to another &#8211; is on the historical agenda. And within
the &#8216;Bolivarian&#8217; process, such a second process of struggle and
change has intensified as events have accumulated the challenges
facing workers in Venezuela. It is not a debate between abstract
arguments, of course, but a battle to build that capacity among
workers to act independently which is the revolutionary impulse. In
the concrete, it has been a question of how workers organise
themselves, and how those organisations connect with the organs of
mass struggle which had developed and expanded so quickly in the face
of the initiatives of the Venezuelan bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>If the visible manifestation of the popular defence of Ch&#225;vez was
the crowds that gathered around Miraflores Palace, the activity of
some workers in oil and manufacturing, in transport and the public
sector was crucial. This was even more the case in the December
2002&#8211;February 2003 lockout. Yet no organisation was available to
co-ordinate and connect their struggles, given the alliance of the
discredited CTV with the bourgeoisie. While the Bolivarian Circles
and popular organisations developed on the ground (Harnecker claims a
combined membership of 1.3 million by September 2003), they were
still organs of government, administered and co-ordinated from above.</p>

<p>In this respect the referendum yields up a paradox. While many on
the left warned that the referendum was a stratagem to reimpose the
limits of bourgeois democracy, the consequence of the vote has been
unexpected and surprising. It is not simply a question of the
numerical success, the achievement of a majority &#8211; it was the
manner of its achievement. The opposition had the mass media at its
disposal as well as the vigorous support of the US and dark warnings
of a possible direct intervention from Colombia. Yet the mass
movement developed organs of local activity and mobilisation in all
the parts that the bourgeois-owned mass media did not reach. The
referendum was not won by Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s lengthy speeches, despite a
tendency of many on the left to hero-worship and attribute every
advance to the superhuman qualities and political leadership of Hugo Ch&#225;vez.</p>

<p>The true history of Venezuela&#8217;s last six years tells a very
different story. Hugo Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s government owes its existence,
indeed its very survival, to the repeated and determined action of
the mass of the Venezuelan lower classes. Time and again they have
shown their potential to provide an alternative power to that of the
bourgeoisie. Yet this has not produced new forms of organisation
based on democracy from below. Each initiative from below has been
expressed as a new impulse or expression of the Bolivarian
revolution. And it is true that most of those forms of resistance and
struggle have identified themselves with the ideology of Bolivarismo.
Yet it is also true &#8211; and critical &#8211; that Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s explanation
of that ideology lends itself to different interpretations and
contains different and sometimes contradictory positions. So it is
that the ideology has been very differently interpreted in the
debates that have developed within the mass movement in the last two years.</p>

<p>The UNT (<em>Uni&#243;n Nacional de Trabajadores</em>), for example, was
formally founded in August 2003 at a congress which claimed to
represent over half a million Venezuelan workers and their
organisations. It was seen as a new national formation in opposition
to the long-established CTV (<em>Congreso de Trabajadores Venezolanos</em>)
whose leadership had played such an overtly counter-revolutionary
role. UNT was clearly closely aligned to Ch&#225;vez and some leading
elements intended it to function as an instrument of working class
mobilisation from above. It is becoming increasingly clear, however,
that within UNT and around it are a series of groups and currents
which are critical of excessively close links to government. The
unease with UNT&#8217;s lack of independence was expressed, for example,
in an interview given to Marta Harnecker by Ram&#243;n Machuca, leader of
the Sutiss union <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a> in early 2003. Machuca, who had led an important
big strike against the privatised steel company SIDOR in 2001 in the
face of opposition from some Chavistas, expressed his concern that
many of the UNT leaders were in fact bureaucrats or political
appointees who would not maintain an independent class position
before government.</p>

<p>This concern has been manifested again and again and with
increasing intensity as the class struggle itself has deepened. Many
of the most combative communities, for example &#8211; like Ant&#237;mano and
El Valle &#8211; insisted that the local leaderships should be directly
elected from below, and rejected nominations from the centre. Whereas
the Bolivarian movement represents a coalition of political
organisations supporting Ch&#225;vez, many of them lack credence with the
masses and are seen as opportunistic Chavistas who are merely taking
advantage of a new political arrangement to advance their personal
ambitions. In the state of Vargas, it was reported, Bolivarian
organisations set up their own &#8216;<em>Maisanta Comando</em>&#8217; (the
name given to the national mobilisation around the referendum)
rejecting the imposition of the official organisation whose leader
was a very recent convert to Ch&#225;vez. And there were many more
similar examples.</p>

<p>In 2005 there will be regional and local elections for governors
and mayors. The lists of candidates for these elections have already
been issued from the centre. Yet a declaration issued by a new
co-ordinator of mass organisations echoes a frequently heard demand
for new lists of candidates elected from below &#8211; and for a
postponement of the elections to allow this to happen:</p>

<p class="quoteb">While it is true that the actions of central government,
and of some local and regional governments, has brought qualitative
advances in the living standards of the people ... it is also true
that the failure to give the people access to forms of participation
in government in a systematic way and in the spirit of the
constitution has allowed practices and modes of work from the past to
persist and continue ... <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a></p>

<p>The call for the creation of &#8216;<em>poder popular</em>&#8217; or
people&#8217;s power &#8211; a direct echo of the Chilean process between
1972 and 1973 &#8211; is a clear demand to deepen and extend the process.
Indeed the declaration calls for a Congress of People&#8217;s Power to be
organised for April 2005. he discussion echoes in its turn a series
of articles and interventions by the ex minister of planning Ronaldo
Denis, who left government in 2001, which are critical of the
compromises and ambiguities in Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s positions.</p>

<p>There is of course a general agreement that the referendum victory
will not mark an end to class struggle in Venezuela. While the
bourgeoisie may pause to regroup and the United States establish a
cautious pragmatic relationship with Ch&#225;vez for the moment, the
class struggle will continue and intensify in the near future. And
while the call for Venezuela to be left alone may be a legitimate
slogan for an international anti-imperialist movement, it makes no
contribution to the development and growth of the left in Venezuela
itself. Ch&#225;vez himself will continue to seek spaces for negotiation
with sections of the Venezuelan bourgeoisie and a renegotiated
position in the wider international market. Rising oil revenues have
provided and will continue to provide resources to finance welfare
provision and the growth of infrastructure as well as some
diversification of production. But a recently announced agreement
with Texaco and ExxonMobil to develop oil and gas production in the
Orinoco is on terms highly favourable to the corporations.</p>

<p>The Ch&#225;vez government has been successfully defended against
attempts to undermine it. But 50 percent of Venezuela&#8217;s population
continue to live in poverty and 20 percent and more are still without
work. Transferring control over oil production from the PDVSA to a
new government ministry is certainly an attack on the old &#8216;state
within a state&#8217; &#8211; but it is still a significant step away from
&#8216;workers&#8217; control&#8217; of this key industry. The media, the banks
and many key areas of service industries (telephones, for example)
remain in the hands of the traditional bourgeoisie. There is still a
considerable distance to go before we can speak of a transfer of
power into the hands of the working class &#8211; which alone gives
meaning to the concept of revolution. Yet fundamental to a definition
of a revolutionary process is that is marked by a growing control
from below, by a cumulative act of self-emancipation by the working classes.</p>

<p>The critical question now &#8211; and it is not a theoretical issue &#8211;
is how the different struggles are co-ordinated and linked to the
working class and its organisations. It is a living debate.</p>

<p>Ch&#225;vez has shown many times that he is bound to a concept of
reconciliation between the warring classes. Hence his decision after
both attempts to overthrow him in 2002 to open the door to
negotiation and &#8216;social peace&#8217;. Equally, he made speeches in
rapid succession in the wake of the referendum ranging from a call to
arm the proletariat to a clear overture to the United States,
promising to maintain the flow of Venezuelan oil to its most
important customer (the US itself). Ch&#225;vez has argued throughout the
last four years, furthermore, for a Latin American economic area
embracing Brazil, Ecuador and others in a revamped Mercosur. The neat
switch from ALCA (the Spanish acronym for the free Trade Area of the
Americas) to ALBA (the Bolivarian Free Trade Area) suggests a new
dawn (alba) for Latin America through an alliance of nation-states.
But even under new conditions, these states &#8211; separately or
together &#8211; would find themselves under an obligation to accept the
conditions of trade in the world market, and inescapably those rules
would bring them into confrontation with their own workers.</p>

<p>If the &#8216;new dawn&#8217; is to begin a process of revolutionary
change, it is the working class &#8211; acting independently in its own
interest, and leading the collective struggles of the poor, the
oppressed and the exploited &#8211; who will carry it forward beyond the
moment of compromise and reconciliation. Chile 1972&#8211;1973 yields up
a dramatic example of how that authentic power from below can look &#8211;
the <em>cordones industriales</em> which brought together delegates
from workers in different factories. And if we need examples of other
possible outcomes, then the ultimate failure of Portugal&#8217;s 1974
revolution may have much to tell us about a political process that
relies on a progressive wing of the military acting on behalf of but
outside the control of the mass movement.</p>

<p>The referendum victory was won from below. Its consolidation &#8211;
and its transformation into a new kind of society &#8211; will depend
once again on the capacity of the working class to use it as a
milestone on the way to a real transfer of power. For that to happen
demands new forms of organisation, democratic, grass roots and
genuinely powerful:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Within the social movements and the political vanguard
there is developing a rebellion against bureaucracy which can longer
be held back. It is the vital masses of Bolivarism without whom the
jargon of the bureaucrats who have claimed to represent them would
fall to pieces in minutes. That rebellion during the referendum
period allowed the &#8216;Battle of Santa In&#233;s&#8217; to be waged on two
fronts at once &#8211; against the class enemy and against the hierarchy.
The referendum has turned into a great opportunity not only to
unleash new forms of organisation but also to draw them together into
a body of proposals that develop along a single line from resistance
to electoral fraud to the creation of new political and institutional
spaces. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It is those new spaces alone that give meaning to the word
&#8216;revolution&#8217;. Tariq Ali, writing after the referendum <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a>, sees
the Bolivarian revolution as no more than an opportunity to develop
social democracy in Venezuela. But this is the era of a new
imperialism marching hand in hand with a global capital that
acknowledges no national frontiers and admits no exception to the
merciless operation of the market. The nation-state may seek to
renegotiate its relationship with that global system through joint
initiatives like Mercosur. But it is only the action of the workers,
the very people who have sustained Hugo Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s revolution thus
far, that can challenge the system itself.</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<h3>Appendix: Some views from the left:</h3>

<p class="quoteb"><em>What Ch&#225;vez is attempting is nothing more or less
than the creation of a radical social-democracy in Venezuela that
seeks to empower the lowest strata of society. In these times of
deregulation, privatisation and the Anglo-Saxon model of wealth
subsuming politics, Ch&#225;vez&#8217;s aims are regarded as revolutionary,
even though the measures proposed are no different to those of the
post-war Attlee government in Britain.</em></p>

<p class="quoteb"><strong>Tariq Ali, <em>Counterpunch</em>, 16 August 2004</strong></p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>I don&#8217;t believe in the dogmatic postulates of
Marxist revolution. I don&#8217;t accept that we are living in a period
of proletarian revolutions. All that must be revised. Reality is
telling us that every day. Are we aiming in Venezuela today for the
abolition of private property or a classless society? I don&#8217;t think
so. But if I&#8217;m told that because of that reality you can&#8217;t do
anything to help the poor, the people who have made this country rich
through their labour &#8211; and never forget that some of it was slave
labour, then I say, &#8216;We part company&#8217;. I will never accept that
there can be no redistribution of wealth in society. Our upper
classes don&#8217;t even like paying taxes. That&#8217;s one reason they hate
me. It&#8217;s better to die in battle, rather than hold aloft a very
revolutionary and very pure banner, and do nothing ...</em></p>

<p class="quoteb"><strong>Hugo Ch&#225;vez in an interview with Tariq Ali</strong></p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>The people are patient, but they are actively
waiting. They are calm but aware, conscious of the need to
consolidate the defeat of the right wing and those dedicated to the
overthrow of Ch&#225;vez.. At the same time people are conscious of the
need for change in the regime itself &#8211; taking on the bureaucratic
sectors linked to the Bolivarian revolution who are more interested
in defending their own privileges than in advancing the interests of
the people. That struggle requires increasing democracy in the
country, building the influence of the mass organisations, and
increasing the people&#8217;s control over the country&#8217;s oil wealth.
All this points to a key demand, which the government has never
seriously addressed &#8211; the expropriation of the big capitalist
groups. On the hills above the capital, Caracas, we could hear
activists posing this question: &#8220;Is this the moment for the
revolution within the revolution?</em></p>

<p class="quoteb"><strong>Luciana Genro and Roberto Robaina, of the new
P-sol party in Brazil</strong></p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>The defeat of the referendum was a major tactical
defeat of US imperialism and its local vassals. But a defeat of
imperialism does not necessarily mean or lead to a revolutionary
transformation, as post-Ch&#225;vez post-election appeals to Washington
and big business demonstrate. The euphoria of the left prevents them
from observing the pendulum shifts in Ch&#225;vez discourse and the
heterodox social welfare neo-liberal economic politics he has
consistently practiced ... He is closer to Franklin Roosevelt&#8217;s New
Deal than Castro&#8217;s socialist revolution.</em></p>
