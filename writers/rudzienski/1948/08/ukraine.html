<p class="fst">Stalin&#8217;s reactionary policy in the Soviet Ukraine prepared the
ground for the fascist reaction of the Ukrainian bourgeoisie in
Poland. The nationalists, led by Colonel Konovalec and supported by
the Communist Party, finally surrendered to Hitler, becoming the Nazi
vanguard in the Polish Ukraine. &#8220;Without Stalin,&#8221; said Trotsky
(that is, without the Comintern&#8217;s criminal policy in Germany),
&#8220;there would have been no Hitler; without the Stalinist repressions
in the Soviet Ukraine there would not have been any Hitler Ukrainian
policy.&#8221; (<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1939/04/ukraine.html" target="new"><em>On the Question of the Ukraine</em></a>)</p>

<p>Caught between two fires, between the oppression of the Polish
bourgeoisie and the Stalinist terror, the proletarian and peasant
masses lost their political balance, their revolutionary momentum,
making possible the advance of the fascist reaction, headed by
Konovalec and his clique. To unleash a war against Russia and deprive
it of a military base and a rich source of grain, Hitler raised the
slogan of a &#8220;Greater Ukraine,&#8221; that is, of a fascist Ukraine, a
colony of the &#8220;Greater German Reich.&#8221; The Ukrainian bourgeoisie
accepted this program and the role of lackey to Nazi Germany, hangman
of its own people and betrayer of its nation.</p>

<p>But for Hitler as for Stalin, the Ukrainian question was simply
&#8220;small change&#8221; in the imperialist war market. When Hitler
occupied part of Czechoslovakia in 1939, he gave
Transcarpatho-Ukraine to the Hungarian barons, without thinking that
a &#8220;Ukrainian Piedmont&#8221; was thereby created for the Konovalec
clique. Stalin interpreted Hitler&#8217;s act against the Ukrainian
people as an evident gesture of peace, as a common alliance of
tyrants and totalitarian hangmen against the oppressed peoples. The
best proof of this statement is provided by the consequent
Stalin-Hitler pact.</p>

<p>But the toilers of the Ukraine drew their own conclusion from
these acts. They understood that the Nazi program of a &#8220;Greater
Ukraine&#8221; was as much a cynical fraud as Stalin&#8217;s position.
Perhaps for this reason the Ukrainian regiments fought loyally beside
the Poles against Hitler, in spite of the Polish pacifications. There
was hardly any great enthusiasm in the Polish Ukraine for the Russian
invasion in 1939. In Stalin&#8217;s totalitarian plebiscite almost fifty
per cent of the population in the countryside and twenty-five per
cent in the cities abstained from voting, that is, from voting in
favor of Russian annexation. Almost ten per cent of the population
voted openly against the occupation.</p>

<p>It is hardly strange that Stalin answered with terror and
reprisals, not only against the Polish population in these
territories but first of all against the Ukrainian population. All
the politically active elements in the Ukraine were summarily
deported, jailed and assassinated by the GPU. The terror was directed
primarily against the leftist intellectuals, workers and peasants,
whether they were ex-Communists or Social-Democrats under suspicion
for their independence. It was also directed against the bourgeois
politicians who had collaborated with Poland, and against the
nationalists who in past years had been protected and praised by the CP.</p>

<p>Out, of almost two million people deported from the Polish
Ukraine, thirty to forty per cent were Ukrainians. In spite of the
Soviet restrictions, forty per cent of General Anders&#8217; Polish army
consisted of Ukrainians who came from Russia in order to struggle
against Hitler. Now these Ukrainian soldiers have no desire to return
to a Polish Ukraine dominated by Russia. The Polish bureaucracy was
replaced by a Russian Stalinist bureaucracy. Lwow, capital of
Galicia, was scoured clean of its Polish majority and its Ukrainian
minority and was repopulated with Russians.</p>

<p>This policy prepared the action of the Ukrainian fascists when the
Nazi invasion of Russia began in 1941. This policy created the
conditions that led hundreds of thousands of Soviet Ukraine soldiers
to surrender to Hitler.</p>

<p>Later, the Nazi terror in the Ukraine impelled them to struggle
once again. This policy created the Ukrainian quisling, General
Vlasov, a Soviet militarist, who went over to Hitler and formed a
Ukrainian army which fought against Russia. The Stalinist occupation
of Galicia and Volhynia in 1939&#8211;41 also created Ukrainian
collaborationism with Hitler, the Ukrainian police who assassinated
Poles and Jews, the collaborationist periodicals, and the puppet
&#8217;authorities in Galicia. It is clear that this collaboration did
not have the popular support of the laboring masses or the peasants.</p>

<p>Hitler&#8217;s Ukrainian policy very quickly dissipated the illusions
of the Ukrainian fascists. In spite of having occupied almost all of
the Ukraine territories, Hitler did not even think of creating a
puppet &#8220;Greater Ukraine.&#8221; Only Galicia had a puppet &#8220;Ukrainian&#8221;
administration in part, controlled by the Germans, while the whole of
the Soviet Ukraine formed the district of the &#8220;East&#8221; administered
by a military governor. The Galician administration never took on the
aspect of an autonomous or independent organism. The Ukrainian Nazis
were used simply as executioners of the Poles, Jews and Russian prisoners.</p>

<p>Hitler&#8217;s &#8220;Greater Ukraine&#8221; turned out to be a fraud like so
many others. The disciples of Konovalec, the Nationalists and
fascists, the Germanophiles, divided into two groups, one of which
continued to collaborate with Hitler and another (headed by Bandera)
which took an anti-German position. The policy of Nazi imperialism
was the most potent factor in disorienting Ukrainian fascism and
demonstrating the impotence and the defeat of the Ukrainian
bourgeoisie which had turned toward Berlin.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Second Stalinist Invasion</h4>

<p class="fst">To some (perhaps to many) Marxists and liberals it may seem that
the Curzon line is, in spite of everything, an act of historic
justice toward the Ukrainian people because it unites the Ukrainian
territories which have been divided for centuries. Besides, it may
seem that this program &#8211; even though realized by Stalin &#8211;
&#8220;corresponds&#8221; to the old Bolshevik program of self-determination,
the union of all the Ukrainian territories with the Soviet Ukraine.
But everything depends on who performs the task: whether it is
carried out by the socialist revolution or the Stalinist
counter-revolution. In the first case it is a progressive work, an
act of justice toward the Ukrainian people, because it signifies its
free self-determination, its social and national emancipation. In the
second case it is totalitarian oppression under Stalin&#8217;s boot.</p>

<p>From this point of view, the partitioning of the Ukrainian
territories between Poland, Russia and Czechoslovakia gave the
Ukrainian people a greater possibility of struggling for its
emancipation, since Stalin favored the Ukrainian opposition against
Poland and Czechoslovakia, and on the other hand, Poland favored the
anti-Stalinist <em>irredenta</em> in the Soviet Ukraine. The Ukrainian
Nationalists considered it a &#8220;Ukrainian Piedmont.&#8221; The Communists
and revolutionaries had a greater possibility of developing their
political struggle against Stalin in Poland than they have now in a
Ukraine dominated by the hangman of the peoples.</p>

<p>The Stalinists argue that they have &#8220;solved&#8221; the Ukrainian
national problem by uniting all the Ukrainian territories under
Stalin&#8217;s sway. The partition of Poland and the annexation of
Galicia and Volhynia is for them the final stage of the democratic
revolution from the national point of view, the completion of the
program of the Russian Revolution. They adduce the fact that they
have liquidated Polish feudalism, distributed the land and
nationalized the industries. In another place (in an article on
Poland) we have demonstrated that Stalinist nationalization of
industry and Stalinist agrarian reform do not signify the
socialization of the means of production nor the emancipation of the
peasantry, but the victorious march of the Stalinist counter-revolution.</p>

<p>Now we must examine the &#8220;realization of the national program&#8221;
in the territories behind the Curzon line. The Stalinist invasion in
1939 began with the deportations <em>en masse</em> to Russia. The
Stalinist invasion in 1944 began with the deportation of millions of
Poles, native to the region, to the west. Since the Poles comprised
an urban population of workers, professionals, bureaucrats and a thin
layer of landlords exempted from previous deportations, this meant
stripping the region of the best productive and social forces, rooted
there for centuries.</p>

<p><em>Almost the whole of the industrial proletariat in these
territories was Polish.</em> These masses of the population were sent
to Silesia and Pomerania in order to replace the German industrial
population. That is to say, this movement of the peoples of the East
toward the west is not only reactionary from the national point of
view but reactionary as well from the productive and social point of
view, reactionary from the point of view of the interests of the
proletariat and the socialist revolution. This does not mean to say
that the Polish population is less cultured than the German, but
undeniably the German industrial worker is more efficient and has
more experience and industrial tradition than the Polish.</p>

<p>No bourgeois revolution ever created such an emigration of the
peoples as did Stalinist &#8220;national&#8221; policy. No settlement of the
national question until now ever required drastic measures of such a
reactionary nature. These measures are the conclusive proof that in
Eastern Europe there took place not a Stalinist &#8220;democratic&#8221;
revolution but an imperialist and totalitarian counter-revolution.</p>

<p>The Ukraine suffers under the weight of this counter-revolution in
a far more tragic manner than does Poland, because Poland possesses
political leadership in the camp of the bourgeoisie as well as in the
camp of the workers and peasants. This political leadership is old,
experienced in the struggle, and has the firm support not only of
certain sectors of the proletariat but the &#8220;conjunctural&#8221; support
of a sector of imperialism. The Polish question for more than a
century was the touchstone which divided the forces of reaction from
those of democracy in Europe, and which now divides the imperialist
forces from those of revolutionary socialism. The Ukraine is isolated
and abandoned to its own fate.</p>

<p>To wind up his crime, Stalin proceeded to deportations <em>en masse</em>
of the Ukrainians native to Western and Central Poland since the
world began, that is to say, who had lived there century on century,
loyal to the Polish state and in harmony with the Polish majority.
Now hundreds of thousands of these Polish-Ukrainians had to abandon
the homes of their fathers and grandfathers to be deported behind the
Curzon line.</p>

<p>What was Stalin&#8217;s intent in pursuing such a policy? To sow hate
among the Poles and Ukrainians because the deportations were carried
out by the Warsaw puppet government; to isolate the Polish and
Ukrainian peoples, not permitting the Ukrainians who were filled with
hatred against Stalin to be infected by the rebellious Poles. Not
even a small portion of the Ukrainian population was able to escape
from Stalin&#8217;s clutches. There was to be no &#8220;Piedmont,&#8221; no isle
of relative liberty for the Ukrainians that might threaten the
security of the Stalinist autocracy. The districts of Sanok,
Przemysl, the Carpathian regions near Cracow were &#8220;cleaned out&#8221;
of Ukrainians to the last soul.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Ukrainian Resistance Movement</h4>

<p class="fst">If the Stalinist Thermidor speeded the growth of Ukrainian
nationalism and fascism, the second totalitarian and imperialist
Stalinist reaction impelled the Ukrainian masses in the direction of
revolution. Hitler&#8217;s defeat and the defeat of Germanophile
Ukrainian fascism, the degeneration of the bands led by Konovalec and
General Vlasov inexorably pushed the people towards a social
struggle. In the last stage of the German occupation, Ukrainian
detachments were created which struggled against the Nazis. The
Stalinist invasion of Eastern Poland, of the territories with a
Ukrainian majority, did not cause great joy among the Ukrainians; the
underground did not disperse but instead consolidated its forces.
When the deportations of Ukrainian peasants to the east began, the
Ukrainian resistance movement took on broader, almost gigantic forms.
The armed Ukrainian detachments were so strong that they could face
not only the police but the regular Polish and Russian armies. The
danger was of such a nalure that the Russians asked collaboration of
the Polish and Czech armies.</p>

<p>The strangest thing is that the Ukrainian resistance, in spite of
struggling against the Poles, <em>could count on the support and
solidarity of the native Poles</em>, who sheltered their Ukrainian
neighbors threatened with deportation, even though they were
scheduled to receive the abandoned lands of the Ukrainians. In the
southern part of Poland, the Warsaw government had to mobilize
several divisions of the Polish army and local militias in order to
combat the Ukrainian bands who were protected by the solidarity of
the Polish-speaking population. The government engaged in reprisals
against the Polish population, deporting it to Eastern Prussia and
Western Pomerania. The war of the Warsaw government against the
Ukrainian population, and the native Polish population which
solidarized itself with the former acquired alarming proportions
after the death of the Stalinist general, Swierczewski, assassinated
by the Ukrainians.</p>

<p>Never did Pilsudski&#8217;s government or the government of the
Colonels send a regular army so armed to the teeth against the
Ukrainians as did the Stalinist Warsaw government. The Ukrainian
people will never forget this when the hour of settlement and
vengeance arrives. Nor will they forget the solidarity and protection
given by the Polish working-class and peasant population to the
persecuted Ukrainians.</p>

<p>The Russian and Polish Stalinists justify these punitive
persecutions on the grounds of the &#8220;fascist&#8221; character of the
Ukrainian bands. As we have already said, it is certain that there
was a Germanophile, pro-Hitlerite orientation among the Ukrainian
nationalists of the Konovalec group. But it is also certain that a
sector of the resistance fought against Hitler before his defeat. Not
receiving the illegal Ukrainian press from Poland, we lack concrete
data, but the problem is not as simple as the Stalinists would paint it.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is a fact that there is peasant resistance
to the deportations, a resistance which merits the support of all
socialists and all those who struggle against barbarism and injustice.</p>

<p>In the second place, the Ukrainian movement is supported by
important sectors of the Polish population, in spite of the fact that
the communiqués of the official press assert that the Ukrainians
struggle against the Polish population.</p>

<p>In the third place, we know that the Polish underground entered
into contact with the Ukrainian resistance movement, and that they
are collaborating in the struggle against the Russian and Polish
Stalinist military detachments. This fact explains more to us than
all the Stalinist theoretical &#8220;theses&#8221; on self-determination. The
Polish underground is not at all anxious to support Ukrainian
fascists who devastate Polish communities.</p>

<p>In the fourth place, the underground cannot all be cut from the
same cloth; of necessity it, has a varied character and takes in all
political positions, from that of the Nationalists to that of the
peasants and workers. But its substantial character is that of
national resistance to the policy of deportations <em>en masse</em>, to
the plundering of the Ukrainian population, an armed resistance to
the terror and oppression of Stalinist imperialism.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Road to Ukrainian Freedom</h4>

<p class="fst">In his authoritative 1939 article, Trotsky had already said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The Fourth International has the obligation of clearly
understanding the enormous importance of the Ukrainian problem, not
only for the destinies of Southeastern and Eastern Europe, but also
for all of Europe. It is a question of a nation which has
demonstrated vital strength, equal in numbers to the population of
France, which occupies an exceptionally rich territory, extremely
important besides from the strategic point of view. The question of
the destiny of the Ukraine, is posed in all its force. A clear slogan
is necessary ... A Workers&#8217; and Peasants&#8217; Soviet Ukraine, united,
free and independent.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst"><em>The separation of the Ukraine from Stalinist Russia has much
greater importance and actuality today than at the time when Trotsky
wrote these lines.</em> It is as fundamental to the socialist
revolution as is the independence of Poland. For this reason we must
define our position toward the Ukrainian revolution, the underground,
and the national resistance to Stalin. If deportations <em>en masse</em>
and the national oppression of the Ukraine are the characteristics of
a &#8220;democratic revolution&#8221; even though &#8220;degenerated,&#8221; then we
must support Stalinism against the &#8220;reactionary&#8221; resistance
movement. <em>If, on the other hand, we have a Stalinist
counter-revolution and imperialist oppression in the Ukraine, then we
must support all progressive forces and not just the socialists, that
is, we must support also the peasants and the democratic petty
bourgeoisie against Stalin.</em> This seems to me to be the correct
Marxist position.</p>

<p>The only remedy for the Stalinist counter-revolution is, and will
continue to be, the socialist revolution; the road to it passes
through the complex struggle of the popular masses, the national
resistance of the Ukrainians to Stalinism. We not only do not wish to
give support to the fascist elements but wish to isolate and fight
them in the course of the struggle against Stalinism. Neither do we
desire to give support to capitalist imperialism which dreams of
using the Ukrainian question as &#8220;small change&#8221; in the manner of
Stalin and Hitler. The Ukrainian bourgeoisie, decimated and defeated,
may perhaps offer its services to this imperialism. But the Ukrainian
bourgeoisie is very weak, without political importance, without a
tradition of struggle, and lacks the confidence of the masses.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian proletariat is strong, although leaderless and
quiescent. The Ukrainian proletariat is our hope, the hope of the
socialist revolution and of the unhappy Ukrainian nation. Its program
is the socialist program, the program of Leon Trotsky for the
Ukraine: <em>a Workers&#8217; and Peasants&#8217; Ukraine, united, free, and
separated from Russia</em>. The separation of the Ukraine from Russia
means the destruction of a fundamental stone in the structure of the
Stalinist tyranny. But this will not be effected in the process of
capitalist restoration or of North American intervention. <em>&#8220;The
program of the independence of the Ukraine in the epoch of
imperialism is directly and indissolubly linked with the program of
the proletarian revolution.&#8221;</em> (Trotsky)</p>

<p>&#8220;This program,&#8221; said Trotsky, &#8220;will not leave one stone on
another in the repugnant edifice of Stalinist Bonapartism.&#8221; This
program signifies the destruction of Stalinist Russia and the
construction of the Socialist United States of Europe. This program
signifies the fraternal alliance of the Ukrainian and Polish
proletariat, of the Ukrainian and Polish peoples, in their struggle
against the Stalinist tyranny.</p>

<p>To bring about the Socialist United States of Europe it is
necessary not only to have destroyed German imperialism, but also to
destroy Stalinist imperialism which inherited the historic mission of
being the prison of the peoples. The separation of the Ukraine from
Russia is the condition <em>sine qua non</em> of this program. The
alliance of the peoples oppressed by the Stalinist tyranny, in the
first place the Poles and Ukrainians, is a powerful weapon in opening
the road of the socialist revolution in Europe.</p>

<p>For this reason we applaud the collaboration of the Polish
resistance with the Ukrainian resistance movement. We applaud and
support the protection given by the Polish population to the
Ukrainian resistance and the deported Ukrainian peasants. We are not
frightened by Stalinist denunciations about supporting Ukrainian &#8220;fascists.&#8221;</p>

<p>Long live a free, independent, workers&#8217; and peasants&#8217; Ukraine,
separated from Russia! Long live the Socialist United States of
Europe! Down with the pestilential corpse of Stalinist reaction!</p>
