<h4>*</h4>

<p class="fst">The development of the workers&#8217; movement in America is daily
acquiring more and more importance. Faced with Europe in its death
throes, both North and South America are becoming the continents of
the future for socialism. The phenomenal development of North
American capitalism and imperialism constitutes the prime event of
our time. The formidable growth of the American workers&#8217; movement,
still trade unionist in its first stage, follows it like a shadow.</p>

<p>But North American trade unions, which have more than 20 million
members, (USA, Canada and Mexico) are something without precedent in
the history of the international working class movement. Even in the
backward and semi-colonial Latin American countries, the workers&#8217;
movement is acquiring day by day more importance and historic weight.
The development of industry in Brazil and Argentina is awakening the
consciousness of the Latin American continent, pushing forward &#8220;the
slow nag of history.&#8221; <em>The Latin American working class, which
until now was almost nil as an independent factor, appears in the
arena as a young and aggressive force, sometimes emerging under the
yoke of Stalinism, but in many countries with the real banner of
revolutionary Marxism.</em></p>

<p>While in Europe the old-time formations, anachronistic social
democratic reformers and Stalinists, still dominate and the
regenerating currents grouped around the Fourth International are
reduced to an insignificant minority, <em>in Latin America, the new
internationalist Left, followed by sympathizing trends inside the
Brazilian and Argentine Social Democracy, are becoming an independent
and sometimes important political factor</em>. It is characteristic
that precisely in the most backward countries of the Pacific coast,
Chile, Bolivia and Peru, the movement led by the Fourth International
is growing relatively faster and acquiring better theoretical
preparation than in the advanced countries on the Atlantic seaboard,
Argentina and Brazil. The weak and rickety native bourgeoisie on the
Pacific coast is not capable of exerting so much influence or
ideological pressure on the proletariat as is the dynamic and
vigorous bourgeoisie of Brazil and Argentina. The social and
political weight of the working classes in the Pacific countries is
relatively much greater than in Brazil or Argentina. For this reason
the two capitalistic republics produce the totalitarian dictatorships
of Vargas and Peron, which confront the tempestuous awakening of the
working masses, absorbing and channelizing it, sometimes with a
policy of social reforms and fascistic demagogy.</p>

<p>In the Pacific countries, the Chilean, Peruvian, Bolivian or
Paraguayan bourgeoisie is not capable of forming such &#8220;solid&#8221;
regimes and has to alternately allow democratic, petty bourgeois
government and short-lived military and Bonapartist dictatorships,
with bloodthirsty methods, such as the regime of Villaroel in
Bolivia, Morinigo in Paraguay and the <em>Apra</em> in Peru. Chile,
occupying an intermediate position in this mosaic, has managed to
form a coalition &#8220;leftist&#8221; government with the support of the
Stalinists. <em>The pattern of Latin American regimes is the boiling
lava of the economic and social transformations of our continent and
at the same time it is the proof of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal
character of Latin America. The rapid and almost daily changes in
these regimes characterize the impotence and weakness of the native
bourgeoisie faced with social transformations and the emancipation
movements of the working masses.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Peruvians Show the Way</h4>

<p class="fst">It is therefore of prime importance when the Marxist doctrine,
raising its sonorous voice in this noisy and living whirlwind of
history, tries to give historic direction to this burning and as yet
formless lava. It is a voice, a living expression of the rhythmic
march of the South American industrial proletariat which is trying,
still instinctively, and sometimes unconsciously, to give organized
forms to this spontaneous historic process. This honorable and
important role is undoubtedly being filled by the manifesto of the
Peruvian Trotskyists, published in the <strong>Fourth International</strong>
(April 1947).</p>

<p>In our former articles we have frequently analyzed the problem of
the democratic revolution in Bolivia, Peru and the Argentine. The
Marxist theory in South America is seeking its historic path, like
the working masses, through the chaotic jungle of history. Some
sectors of the Argentine Trotskyists feel overwhelmed and
defenseless, faced with the phenomenon of industrial development in
Argentina and the swashbuckling despotism of Peron. These sectors bow
to the pressure of Peronism, proclaiming it the realization of the
democratic bourgeois revolution, not only in Argentina, but in the
whole of Latin America.</p>

<p>The Bolivian miners, in their congress at Pulacayo, proclaimed a
formidable revolutionary thesis in which they showed the democratic
bourgeois revolution as the proletariat&#8217;s immediate task. Both the
miners&#8217; congress and the thesis were under the auspices of the
Revolutionary Workers Party (POR), a section of the Fourth
International. To do them justice, one should explain that the
contents of the democratic bourgeois revolution of the Bolivian POR
is fundamentally different from the Stalinist contents of the same,
and considers that the revolution can only be carried out under the
dictatorship of the proletariat, through the alliance of the
proletariat with the peasants, whereas the Stalinists propose
alliance between the &#8220;progressist&#8221; liberal bourgeoisie and the
proletariat. <em>But the POR&#8217;s thesis does not underline the
international character of this revolution, but treats it as an
isolated phenomenon, thus slipping toward the concept of revolution
and socialism in just one country.</em> For this reason the voice of
our Peruvian comrades is of fundamental importance in clearing up and
solving this central problem of Marxism in South America.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>How the Problem Is Posed</h4>

<p class="fst">How do the Peruvian comrades pose this problem?</p>

<p>&#8220;The Latin American revolution will be a stage, a phase of the
world revolution, and nothing else. It will be purely and simply the
socialist revolution&#8221; (Mariategui) This classic thesis of the
quoted master is the central idea, the axis of the manifesto. Like
all great things, Mariategui&#8217;s thesis has the simplicity of genius
and leaves no room for any doubts.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The international character of modern economy permits
no country to escape from the process of transformation which
originates in the present-day conditions of production ...
Imperialism bars the economic program of nationalization and
industrialization in every semi-colonial country which it exploits as
a market for its capital and commodities, and as a source of raw materials.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We cannot solve democratic revolution within the
national or international framework of bourgeois society .... We are
a semi-colony of Yankee imperialism.... The Peruvian bourgeoisie is
closely bound to North American imperialism ... The fate of our
weak-jointed national bourgeoisie is intimately bound up with the
fate of the entire world capitalist system ... The real big
bourgeoisie is not in Peru but in Wall Street, this fierce enemy of
democratic and national revolution.&#8221; (<strong>Manifesto</strong>)</p>

<p class="fst">We have not much to add to these lapidarian phrases. In the
Pacific coast countries the exploitation of <em>guano</em> and <em>salitre</em>
in Chile and Peru, of tin in Bolivia, has been the work of European
imperialist capitalism and has replaced the colonial feudal formation
of Spanish economy. <em>The age of gold and silver has been replaced
by the age of guano, salitre, tin, copper and lead!</em> This was the
stage of liberal capitalism when Great Britain penetrated the
countries of Latin America. In the imperialist stage of capitalism
between the First and Second World Wars, British capitalism was
displaced by North American expansion and forced to take second
place. <em>The whole of Latin America, especially the small.
countries, has reached a state of being semi-colonies of the USA.</em>
North American capital today occupies all the key economic positions.
The slight mining bourgeoisie of Peru, Bolivia or Chile is bound up
with North American capital. The middle bourgeoisie depends partly on
mining interests and partly on the semi-feudal economy of the land,
where the big <em>haciendas</em> are still run on a feudal-slave
system. &#8220;Peruvian plutocracy is really subordinate to Wall Street
finance capital.&#8221; Therefore, all the Peruvian bourgeoisie belongs
in the counter-revolutionary camp.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Petty Bourgeois Nationalism</h4>

<p class="fst">The petty bourgeoisie which, around 1920, raised the
anti-imperialist banner, passed over with its most representative
party, the <em>Apra</em>, and its leader, Haya de la Torre, by an
evolution toward frank reaction. <em>Apra</em>, which was demanding
Indo-American unity, the internationalization of the Panama Canal,
nationalization of big industries and feudal haciendas, and was
fighting against imperialism, forgot its own program on taking power
and capitulated both before Yankee imperialism and native plutocracy.
&#8220;The petty bourgeois anti-imperialists of the 20&#8217;s have been
transformed into the bourgeois pro-imperialists of the 40&#8217;s.&#8221; (<strong>Manifesto</strong>)</p>

<p><em>The democratic revolution is the task of the proletarian
revolution</em> is the title of the corresponding chapter in the
<strong>Manifesto</strong>. &#8220;The country&#8217;s economic emancipation can be
achieved only through the action of the proletarian masses in
solidarity with the world anti-imperialist struggle.&#8221; (Mariategui)
In view of the close ties between native feudo-bourgeoisie and
imperialism, and the capitulation of the petty bourgeoisie, only the
proletariat, allied with the peasants, can carry out a social
revolution in Peru, <em>the fundamental contents of which would be
socialist and proletarian</em>, although in its first stages it would
accomplish the tasks of the democratic revolution, such as the
economic and national emancipation of Peru and the agricultural
revolution in the country. The Peruvian comrades pose the problem of
the democratic revolution in a completely opposite form from certain
sectors of Argentine Trotskyism, which consider the reactionary
policy of Peron as the realization of the belated democratic
revolution in Latin America. The Peruvians, like Mariategui, layout
the perspective of the internationalist socialist revolution, which
will solve the backward democratic problems on its way. The motor
force of this revolution is the Latin American proletariat and not
the bourgeoisie or the petty bourgeoisie. This viewpoint is also
different from the Bolivian POR&#8217;s formulation and from that of the
miners&#8217; congress in Pl1lacayo, which considered as their immediate
stage the realization of the democratic bourgeois revolution under
the dictatorship of the proletariat, forgetting the international and
permanent character of the revolution. The Peruvians, disciples of
the great Mariategui, declare plainly that &#8220;in the course of its
development the democratic revolution passes into the socialist
revolution and thus constitutes itself the permanent revolution.&#8221;
(Trotsky) They also declare that &#8220;the socialist revolution is
international. or else is not socialist at all.&#8221; <em>Therefore the
national and economic emancipation of Latin America can only be
carried out along the path of the international socialist revolution,
beginning with the defeat of North American imperialism, which today
is the fortress of world capitalism.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Role of the <em>Manifesto</em></h4>

<p class="fst">The Peruvian Trotskyist <strong>Manifesto</strong> means, to our way of
thinking, an event in the life of the Latin American proletariat,
being a chain in the social and political process of our continent.
Under the pressure of the masses, Vargas&#8217; regime falls in Brazil, a
&#8220;leftist&#8221; government is set up in Chile, Benavides&#8217; military
dictatorship falls in Peru, and the <em>Apra</em> comes to power,
Villaroel&#8217;s regime falls in Bolivia, Morinigo&#8217;s dictatorship
becomes shaky in Paraguay.</p>

<p>The fall of Villaroel&#8217;s regime in the popular revolution
produces a revolutionary upsurge of the working masses, led by the
Fourth International. Of course, this movement is fairly complex, it
has many weaknesses and lacks theoretical quality. The decadence of
<em>Apra</em>&#8217;s dictatorship in Peru produces the birth of the GOM
(Marxist Workers&#8217; Group) in the face of Stalinist treachery. If
this group lacks influence over the masses, it nevertheless
represents the outstanding school of Marxist theory in South America,
led by Mariategui. It stands at the head of the Trotskyist movement
in matters of theory and makes plain the tasks of the revolution,
which have been wrongly posed in Argentina and have become foggy in
the section of the Fourth International in Bolivia. The Fourth
International movements in Peru and Bolivia complement each other
reciprocally, being links of the same revolutionary chain which sets
its seal on the tortuous historical process.</p>

<p>In Brazil, the powerful and dynamic bourgeoisie transmitted its
pressure upon the proletariat by means of the Stalinists, who in the
wartime interests of Moscow hailed Vargas as the source of the
democratic revolution. This same pattern repeats itself today in
Argentina where the Stalinists support Peron as an anti-imperialist.
In the Cordillera countries, which centuries ago were the center of
the collectivist empire of the Incas, the petty bourgeoisie embraces
a Nazi ideology, like the NMR in Bolivia, or a nationalist one like
the <em>Apra</em> in Peru, demagogically hailing the &#8220;national
revolution&#8221; and the &#8220;anti-imperialist program.&#8221; But on arriving
in power, these movements failed since they capitulated before the
native feudo-bourgeoisie and American imperialism. The Bolivian NMR
lasted only a few years. The Peruvian <em>Apra</em> struggled for
nearly a quarter of a century to take power. <em>But neither of these
two movements was able to expropriate the bourgeoisie, carry out
agricultural reform or maintain the struggle against imperialism.</em>
The failure, the Canossa of the native petty bourgeoisie faced with
imperialism, constitutes the best proof against the Stalinist
&#8220;theory&#8221; of the bourgeois revolution as a stage in itself and
against the reflections of this theory in the Marxist camp, the
Fourth International. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The
social revolution in Latin America must be one, it must be
continental and international, a socialist revolution which carries
out the democratic tasks as part of the chain of revolution in both
Americas. The Peruvian Trotskyists, in making this clear, did an
important theoretical labor.</p>
