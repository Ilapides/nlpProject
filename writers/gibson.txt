On 19 November 1915 Joe Hill was executed by the State of Utah
on trumped up charges. Dave Gibson reminds us of the power of Hill's
organising and songwriting skills at a time of upheaval in US
politics.
When Alfred Hayes wrote the words Joe Hill Ain’t Never Died
in a poem about Joe Hill’s murder, he could never have imagined
that this would still be true a century later.
Paul Robeson popularised Hayes’s poem, now set to music. So did
Joan Baez and Pete Seeger. Other writers have celebrated Hill’s
life and exposed the injustice of his judicial murder through
historical accounts, novels, plays and film.
Joe Hill was born Joel Hagglund in Sweden in 1879 and emigrated to
America in 1902. He worked his way across the country during the next
decade, joining the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), known as
the Wobblies, in 1910 in California.
The Wobblies were formed in 1905 to build “one big union” to
wage the class war with the aim of destroying capitalism. They had an
enormous impact in the US for the next 12 years. They led mass
strikes of workers that the American Federation of Labour dismissed
as unorganisable. They organised immigrant textile workers,
agricultural workers, black and women workers. Many strikes were
victorious, most famously the Lawrence textile strike of 1912.
In many Western towns the Wobblies led successful free speech
campaigns to establish their ability to organise workers. Those
campaigns involved defying city laws banning IWW street meetings.
IWW campaigns were met with state violence and imprisonment.
Thousands of free speech campaigners were arrested, hundreds of
strikers imprisoned, and dozens killed, including John Ramy, an 18
year old Syrian in the Lawrence strike who was bayoneted to death by
a soldier.
Joe Hill was involved in many IWW campaigns, including the Fraser
River strike in British Columbia and the free speech fight in Fresno,
California, and fought alongside other Wobblies in the Mexican
Revolution throughout the 1910s.
He described his motivation, writing:
“The working class and the employing class have nothing
in common. There can be no peace, so long as hunger and want are
found among millions of working people, and the few, who make up the
employing class, have all the good things in life.”
Joe Hill is remembered when so many other Wobbly martyrs are
forgotten because he wrote many of the most popular songs in the
Wobblies’ Little Red Songbook. Tens of thousands of workers
across the US sang his songs. Satirical parodies of hymns helped IWW
street meetings compete with Salvation Army hymn singing. Hill’s
most famous song, The Preacher and the Slave, ridicules a
well-known Salvation Army hymn’s original function of trying to
persuade workers to accept their lot now, in t
he hope of a heavenly
paradise later. Its chorus spells it out:
You will eat bye and bye / In that glorious land
above the sky / Work and pray, live on hay / You’ll get
pie in the sky when you die.
His first published song was Casey Jones: The Union Scab
(1911) supporting a strike on the Southern Pacific Railway. It
rewrote a popular song to condemn scabbing and was an immediate
success. The Wobblies sold Hill’s song on coloured cards for strike
funds. He wrote songs for both the Fraser River and the Lawrence
strikes. Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, one of the Lawrence strike leaders,
wrote that his songs “lilt and laugh and sparkle, kindle the fires
of revolt in the most crushed spirit”. Hill wrote The Rebel Girl
in praise of her.
One reporter commented on the Lawrence strikers that “they are
always marching and singing” while another wrote, “I shall not
forget the curious lift, the strange, sudden fire of the mingled
nationalities when they broke into the universal language of song.”
Singing welded the strikers together.
Joe Hill’s satirical songs tell the stories of workers duped
into supporting the capitalist system. For Hill, songs dressed “cold,
common-sense facts ... in a cloak of humour to take the dryness out
of them” and were more effective than pamphlets.
Strikes had hit Utah hard in 1913 so the establishment was looking
for revenge. Joe Hill had been active there and they put him on trial
for murder. The trial was a sham. There was no real evidence linking
Joe to the murder. When he was found guilty and sentenced to death
the IWW mounted a huge defence campaign.
They produced a special Joe Hill edition of the Little Red
Songbook, organised protests around the country and inundated the
state governor and President Woodrow Wilson with letters and
telegrams. All efforts failed and Hill was executed.
His coffin was transported to Chicago where he was cremated the
following week with a funeral procession of 30,000. His famous last
message, “Don’t waste any time in mourning – organise”, was
read to the crowd.
In his funeral oration Wobbly leader Big Bill Haywood said Joe
Hill’s “songs will be sung wherever the workers toil, urging them
to organise”. That continues to be true for songs like There is
Power in a Union and Workers of the World Awaken. The
latter begins:
Workers of the world awaken / Break your chains,
demand your rights / All the wealth you make is taken / By
exploiting parasites.
Truly a message for today.

Beautifully produced new book In Loving Memory of Work records the Great Miners’ Strike through its art, design and photographs, writes TUSC candidate for Barnsley Central Dave Gibson



*
Barnsley graphic designer Craig Oldham has produced a powerful and
stimulating record of the 1984–85 Miners’ Strike.
His book tells the strike’s story by grouping together
fascinating photographs and examples of graffiti, cartoons, posters,
badges and record sleeves from the time.
Craig is from a striking mining family, and part of the book’s
power comes from that personal involvement.
His Battle of Orgreave section doesn’t just discuss the
importance of John Harris’s famous photograph of a mounted
policeman swinging his baton at a Women Against Pit Closures (WAPC)
activist. It also includes a photo of his dad being arrested there.
The thoughts of Craig’s mother and miner grandfather about the
strike sit alongside those of left wing filmmaker Ken Loach and
artist Jeremy Deller.
The book takes its title from words on one of many black rosettes
that WAPC members left on the steps of 10 Downing Street during a
national demonstration in August 1984.
The rosettes dramatically symbolise Tory prime minister Margaret
Thatcher’s desire to destroy the National Union of Mineworkers
(NUM) and the mining industry. 

Even the book’s black dust jacket emphasises that point. It’s
made out of coal-dust from the muck stack at Barnsley Main Colliery.
The book contains many evocative images. They range from the
poster of The Clash’s Scargill’s Christmas Party gig at the
Brixton Academy to the union banners designed by Andrew Turner and Ed Hall.
 
Disturbing
Turner’s disturbing banner for North Selby NUM and Hall’s
uplifting one for the Unite union’s South Yorkshire community
branch are both beautifully reproduced.
A personal favourite – and one I had never seen before – is a
poster for the Normanton and Altofts Miners Support group.
It’s entitled A–Z of a Miner’s Wife, starting at
“Arthur forever” and finishing with “Zip it up MacGregor.
We’ll never give in.”
I was delighted to see Craig paying tribute to Paul Morton,
another political Barnsley graphic designer.
Paul’s Support The Miners Cards for the radical Leeds
Postcards company raised over Â£30,000 for the strike fund. I still
have one on my pin board where it has been for the last 30 years.
But perhaps the most powerful section is the one exploring the
strike’s graffiti.
There is the humour of the miners defending the NUM HQ wearing toy
police helmets emblazoned with “NUM Snatch Squad”.
And there is the raw anger caught in the picture of the march back
to work at the end of the strike at Armthorpe colliery in Doncaster.
It shows miners and their supporters marching past a wall
emblazoned with a hangman’s noose and the slogan “We Won’t
Forget The Scabs.”
This is a beautifully produced book. Buy it – or if you can’t
afford it, demand your local library gets a copy.
 



This exhibition of more than 30 of Barbara Hepworth’s Hospital
Drawings is the first time that so many of these powerful pieces
have been shown together. She drew them between 1947 and 1949, during
the birth of the NHS, having been allowed into several operating
theatres as an observer.
During the Second World War Hepworth and her family lived in St
Ives, Cornwall. Her daughter fell ill with osteomyelitis and required
extensive hospital care which Hepworth and her partner struggled to
afford. The chance to observe in operating theatres came out of the
friendship that developed between her daughter’s surgeon and
herself.
Hepworth is most famous for her abstract sculptures, but these
drawings have recognisable people in them as they focus on surgeons
and nurses at work. However, she concentrates just on their eyes and
hands; the rest of their bodies are covered in face masks, caps and
gowns which give them a smooth flowing, almost sculptural, quality.
Their gracefulness is emphasised, until they become almost spiritual figures.
Many of the drawings are in oil and pencil, but with washed oil
that softens boundaries and blends one person into another.
Her interest is in the collective work effort: most of the
drawings highlight a group totally absorbed in a particular operation
– whether it is a surgeon with implements in hand, or a nurse
poised to intervene. The implements she focuses on range from
scalpels to hammers and chisels, which emphasise the link with the
way a sculptor works. Hepworth commented in a lecture to surgeons,
“There is a very close affinity between the work of surgeons and
sculptors.”
She goes on to say that in her view “the medical profession, as
a whole, seeks to restore and maintain the beauty and grace of the
human mind and body.”
That comes through strongly in her drawings. The medical staff’s
hands are delicate but strong, their eyes full of understanding and
compassion. Their only concern is the restoration to full health of
the patient in front of them.
The drawings convey a collective, intense desire to heal, and to
improve people’s quality of life. The hammer and chisel are life
enhancing, not threatening.
These drawings celebrate the creativity and dedication of groups
of professional workers. Their motivation is clearly to help others,
not to make money. They are the values that underpinned the
development of a free health service.
Hepworth’s personal experiences and socialist values led her to
welcome the setting up of the NHS – but these drawings are not NHS
propaganda. They are a tribute to human endeavour.
It is ironic that in the week this exhibition opened in Wakefield
the medical secretaries and other clerical workers at the local
hospital began a campaign of strike action against redundancies and
pay cuts caused by the government’s attempts to destroy that free
health service.
Barbara Hepworth: The Hospital Drawings is on at The
Hepworth Gallery, Wakefield until 3 February 2013
 



Woody Guthrie was born on 14 July 1912 in Okemah, Oklahoma. He
died in 1967 in relative obscurity, having been hospitalised for the
last 15 years of his life. Yet his music continues to be an
inspiration for musicians from Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen to
Billy Bragg. The centenary of his birth has seen a flurry of new
books, CDs and concerts celebrating his music.
His songs attack poverty, racism, fascism (he had a sticker on his
guitar saying “This machine kills fascists”) and the system that
creates such evils. His songs are on the side of workers, which is
why, in a world still ravaged with the same problems, his music
retains such power.
Perhaps his most famous song is This Land is Your Land,
written originally as a riposte to the patriotic song God Bless
America. Ironically it is often taken to be patriotic and is
frequently sung with three of its original verses missing – the
verses attacking private property and hunger.
But This Land is Your Land still has the power to anger the
right. When Pete Seeger and Bruce Springsteen sang it at Obama’s
inauguration concert in January 2009 the then Fox News commentator
Glenn Beck fulminated that it “is a song about a progressive utopia
with no ownership of property”. Tom Morello sang the full version
to a strike rally in Wisconsin last year, calling it “a
revolutionary class-war anthem”.
Guthrie moved to California in 1937, following hundreds of
thousands of his fellow “dust bowl” refugees from Oklahoma. They
were fleeing drought and destitution, hoping for a better life.
Instead they were faced with police violence, brutal exploitation and
appalling living conditions.
When Guthrie got his own radio show in Los Angeles he started
writing songs about how the Okies (as the refugees were labelled)
were treated. By 1938 Woody had made contact with the Communist Party
(CP). He was impressed by the way they supported the Californian
agricultural workers’ struggles. He performed at strike benefits
and CP events, delivering food relief to strikers and writing a
regular column for the communist press.
In 1940 he moved to New York. He maintained his support for the CP
during the Cold War and the McCarthy anti-communist witch-hunts
because “the Communists have always been the hardest fighters for
the trade unions and equal rights for every person of every colour”.
That year his Dustbowl Ballads album was released,
which included songs like Tom Joad, which retells the story of
The Grapes of Wrath, John Steinbeck’s classic novel about
Californian migrants. In 1941 he joined the Almanac Singers and went
on a nationwide tour singing to strike rallies and local unions. When
the US joined the Second World War the Almanac Singers threw
themselves into producing anti-fascist songs.
As well as singing about contemporary experiences, Woody sang
about powerful episodes from working class history. For instance, the
song Ludlow Massacre tells the story of a 1914 miners’ strike in
Ludlow, Colorado, which was brutally attacked by state troopers who
killed 13 children. The song tells how the miners fought back, and
ends with the line:
“I said ‘God Bless the Mineworkers Union’ /
And then I hung my head and cried”.
For a time Guthrie was openly racist on his Californian radio
show, until challenged by a black listener. His ideas changed
dramatically from then on.
In 1946 a black Pacific War veteran, Isaac Woodard, tried to use a
whites-only toilet in South Carolina. He was so savagely beaten he
lost his sight. There was a New York benefit concert with Count
Basie, Billie Holiday and others including Guthrie. Guthrie’s song
told Woodward’s story:
“I thought I fought on the islands to get
rid of their kind / But I can see the fight lots plainer now
that I am blind”.
In January 1948 he read a newspaper report of a plane crash in
California in which 28 Mexican deportees (who had been working in the
same fields the Okies had ten years before) were killed alongside
three white crew. The crew were all named but the Mexicans were just
labelled deportees. He exploded with anger and wrote the song
Deportee. Its chorus runs:
“Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita, / Adios mis amigos, Jesus y Maria / You won’t have a name when you ride the big airplane / All they will call you is deportees”.
Guthrie’s attacks on capitalism, expressed brilliantly in his
music, remain as fresh and relevant today as when he first wrote them.
 






Eclipse Theatre company’s production of A Raisin in the Sun brings to life Lorraine Hansberry’s 1959 play of US society in turmoil says Dave Gibson



*
A Raisin in the Sun
Directed by Dawn Walton
A Raisin in the Sun is set in the 1950s US in an overcrowded apartment in Chicago’s Southside. It’s based around the five members of the tight-knit black Younger family.
The play made a huge impact when it was written by Lorraine Hansberry in 1959.
The Eclipse Theatre company’s revival is a powerful take on Hansberry’s drama. It shows racism blighting the Youngers’ lives – and black people standing up to it.
Angela Wynter gives a convincing performance as the mother Lena Younger, as does Susan Wokoma as her student daughter Beneatha.
It begins with Lena waiting for a $10,000 insurance cheque after her late husband’s death.
Beneatha aspires to be a doctor and her brother Walter wants to be a businessman.
But Walter’s ambition clashes with his mother’s dream of buying a new family home, because both depend on the insurance cheque.
The tension ratchets up when Lena puts a deposit on a house in Clybourne Park, an all-white area.
 
Threats
A white representative from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association tries to persuade the family not to move in by using bribery and racist threats.
Lena gives Walter control of the rest of the money, while telling him what she wants him to do with it. The resulting tensions threaten to rip the family apart.
Political ideas also fizz through the play. Beneatha is inspired by her African heritage and African liberation struggles, and wrestles with ideas of identity.
She cuts off what her Nigerian boyfriend Asagai calls her “mutilated hair” to leave it close-cropped and unstraightened.
Beneatha resists what she calls the “dominant” and “oppressive culture” of White America. And she challenges the sexism of the men around her.
The title comes from Langston Hughes’ poem A Dream Deferred.
He asks, “What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or does it explode?”
All the adult Youngers dream of a better life for the family.
This production brings out how their struggles to achieve those dreams clash with the exploitation and racism of US society.
 



Dare Devil Rides to Jarama
by Neil Gore
Townsend Productions’ latest play tells the story of two
Communists – dirt track racer Clem “Dare Devil” Beckett and
intellectual Chris Caudwell. They join the International Brigades to
fight Franco’s fascists in Spain.
David Heywood and Neil Gore give virtuoso acting performances,
playing all the parts. All their work combines song with quick-fire
scenes with imaginative settings.
The songs of folk artist Ewan MacColl capture the spirit of young
Communists from Manchester in the early 1930s.
One of the most memorable songs tells the story of the 1932 Kinder
Scout Mass Trespass.
Thousands of protesters, including Clem, defied the landowners to
walk across the Derbyshire countryside.
The first act focuses on Clem as he tries to organise a dirt track
riders association to stand up to their unscrupulous bosses.
Blacklisted, he becomes a wall of death rider, and works at Fords
as a mechanic.
Clem volunteers to drive ambulances to Spain to support the
Republican side. Chris is a volunteer driver too.
The second act is all set in Spain from their arrival up to the
Battle of Jarama in 1937.
The second act is pacier than the first. It centres on exchanges
between the two comrades while they are stationed at the British
Battalion training camp.
Two contrasting characters, they are linked by their desire to
fight for a better world and crush the fascist uprising.
The spirit of resistance burns through everything they do and the play.
 



American novelist, journalist and socialist Jack London died
100 years ago. Dave Gibson outlines his passionate activism for
workers' rights and his political novels, as well as the
contradictions in his work.
When Jack London died on 22 November 1916 he had been one of the
best known American socialists. His fame was built on both the
realism of his novels and his socialist journalism and public speaking.
By the time he joined the Oakland Socialist Labour Party in 1896
aged 20, he had been a sailor, a tramp, an oyster-pirate, had worked
in factories and had been jailed for 30 days as a vagrant. London
poured his experience of working ten-hour shifts in a cannery as a 15
year old into his short story The Apostate, which describes
how capitalism’s exploitation of child labour destroys both
childhood and the family. So powerful was it that it was reprinted as
a socialist pamphlet.
In 1901 London joined the Oakland branch of the newly-formed
Socialist Party and was twice the Socialist candidate for mayor.
Before then he had headed to the Klondike in the 1897 Gold Rush, an
experience which stimulated much of his writing, most famously the
novel Call of the Wild.
Then in 1902 he spent three months in London’s East End
researching what became The People of the Abyss, in which he
described “the economic degradation of the poor”. In one chapter
London describes walking with a carter and a carpenter, two men
physically broken by decades of hard work. He watches them “picking
up ... orange peel, apple skin ... stray crumbs of bread” which
they “chewed and swallowed ... in the heart of the ... wealthiest
and most powerful empire the world has ever seen.” The book is full
of such damning detail, backed up by thoroughly researched
statistical evidence of inequality and injustice explaining how the
capitalist system creates the poor and destitute.
Over the next few years the Socialist Party grew in size and
influence. In 1905 London both supported the Russian Revolution and
helped launch the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, touring the
country lecturing to students on socialism. He campaigned
successfully in 1906 for the dropping of the charges of conspiracy to
murder against Big Bill Haywood and two other leaders of the Western
Federation of Miners. His article Something Rotten in Idaho
rips into the real conspiracy – that perpetrated by the mine-owners
and the state legal machine against Haywood and his comrades.
His most political novel, The Iron Heel, was published in
1908. It describes how an oligarchy of American capitalists called
the Iron Heel crush trade union and socialist resistance between 1912
and 1932. As one of the capitalists says, “We will grind you
revolutionists down under our heel ... the world is ours ... and ours
it will remain.”
The main text purports to be a manuscript written by one of the
early 20th century revolutionaries and found four centuries after
“the final triumph of socialist democracy”. In 1937 Trotsky wrote
of the novel, “London is an optimist ... a penetrating and
farsighted one,” because the terrible defeat described in the novel
is met by continued resistance and ultimate victory. The novel
dramatises both the debate between reform and revolution and the rise
of fascism.
The main hero, Ernest Everhard, swings from hoping “for a
peaceable victory at the ballot box” to recognising the need for
the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism. He is unable to convince
the bulk of socialist leaders of this argument and the forces of the
Iron Heel crush democracy and the forces of socialism.
Everhard’s shift mirrors that of London. He learnt from the
suppression of the 1905 Russian Revolution the ruthlessness of the
ruling class. He later wrote, “History shows that no master class
is ever willing to let go without a quarrel” and will use
governments, armies and militias to keep power. He opposed the
growing reformist tendencies in the Socialist Party.
There are major weaknesses in his thinking and writing. He clung
to white supremacist ideas through most of his life, frequently being
openly racist, both in his novels and in articles. Yet in his
oft-quoted 1905 speech, Revolution, he could say, “The
comradeship of the revolutionists passes over geographical lines
[and] transcends race prejudice.”
Similar contradictions occur elsewhere in his thinking. He
initially welcomed the 1911 Mexican Revolution writing to the “dear
brave [Mexican] comrades” “we ... are with you heart and soul in
your efforts to overthrow slavery and autocracy.” His short story
The Mexican captures that spirit of solidarity. But by 1914 he
backed American aggression against Mexico. In 1913 London wrote,
“Down with the army and the navy. We don’t need killing institutions.”
The Socialist Party opposed the First World War as “a bloody and
senseless conflict” caused by “imperialist and commercial
rivalries,” and this view was confirmed in a September 1915
membership ballot. Yet London was enraged by this and supported the
Allies’ war against Germany. Subsequently, in March 1916 he
resigned from the Socialist Party and died months later aged just 40.
Notwithstanding deep flaws in his thinking, the best of his
writing – whether describing the evils of capitalist society or
resistance to it – is still worth socialists reading.
 



Barry Hines was born into a mining family in Hoyland Common, a pit
village near Barnsley, in 1939. He qualified as a teacher and taught
in Barnsley secondary schools before becoming a full-time writer.
Hines’s work is characterised by his ear for dialogue, his
sympathetic use of Barnsley dialect and his identification with
working class struggles.
Hines sides with the downtrodden and revels in how they fight
back. His characters find humour in the bleakest of situations, from
youth unemployment in Looks and Smiles (1981) to class
conflict between the aristocracy and agricultural workers in The
Gamekeeper (1975).
Hoyland Common and the surrounding countryside figure in Hines’s
1968 novel A Kestrel for a Knave (filmed by Ken Loach as Kes
in 1969) and The Heart of It (1994). Those two novels plus The
Price of Coal, which was a two-part BBC play in 1977 (turned into
a novel in 1979), form a trilogy on miners and mining communities.
A Kestrel for a Knave tells the story of Billy Casper,
about to leave his secondary modern school. He is bullied by his
miner brother and largely ignored by his mother. The education system
has failed him. As Billy comments about his teachers, “They’re
not bothered about us, just because we’re in 4C ... they talk to us
like muck.” Yet since he was young, Billy has been interested in
birds. His potential flowers as he trains a young kestrel. He teaches
himself from a falconry handbook, showing great perseverance and
skill. Yet at the end of the book there is little hope for Billy.
The Price of Coal is set in a pit getting ready for a royal
visit, which then has a fatal disaster several weeks afterwards. It
was screened in the year of both the Silver Jubilee and the Labour
government’s plans to impose a divisive productivity scheme on the
National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). The novel takes sides on both
questions. Hines ridicules the preparations that management make to
get the pit ready for royalty. At the same time he shows the pressure
on management to increase production which leads to the fatal
explosion. The central character, Syd Storey, is opposed to the
visit, and highly critical of his NUM branch officials. He argues
that they are only getting the visit because their officials are “as
soft as shit and wouldn’t oppose it”. He, and the NUM officials
at militant neighbouring pits, are called extremists by Meakin, his
branch secretary. Syd replies that Meakin is trying “to discredit
anybody who’s not walking hand in glove with management ... who
puts the interests of the men first”.
The Heart of It develops that theme further. It spans the
mining industry from nationalisation to privatisation while
concentrating on the 1984–5 strike. It focuses on the Rickards
family. Harry Rickards was NUM branch secretary for 26 years and a
strike stalwart. He can barely speak, having had a stroke. Harry is a
lifelong Communist for whom the Russian Revolution felt like a “dawn
of hope and promise of a better world”. Harry’s estranged son
Karl returns home and starts to discover what his village endured
during the strike, from police riots to picket line violence. He
finds how the community organised to get through, including his
mother Maisie’s leading role in the Women’s Action Group.
Maisie’s funeral oration for her husband sums up the ongoing
spirit of resistance:
“All Harry wanted ... was a just society. And the
battle’s not over, not by a long chalk ... We might have lost the
strike [but we showed] what you can do when people work together ...
fighting for a cause.”
Barry Hines knew which side he was on. He will be missed.
 



Rhiannon Giddens first made her name with the Carolina Chocolate
Drops, who played string-band music, heavily relying on the banjo and
fiddle. The band formed after the first Black Banjo Gathering in
North Carolina in 2005 and helped to reclaim a lost tradition of
African-American country music. Their music reached its peak in 2010
with the joyful sounds of “Genuine Negro Jig.”
Freedom Highway is Giddens’ second solo album. Most of
the songs are written by her and tell of racist and sexual violence
from slavery and the Civil War through the Civil Rights Movement and
up to today. There is a brutal continuity in these experiences, “an
old, old song” as she describes it.
Two of the songs come from the Civil Rights Movement. The Staples
Singers’ Freedom Highway is a driving song of determined
resistance, while Richard Farina’s Birmingham Sunday
poignantly describes the racist murder of four young black girls when
an Alabama church was bombed in 1963.
But the spirit of resistance imbues all of her own compositions as
well. “You can take my body ... but not my soul” she sings in At
the Purchaser’s Option, a story of babies sold into slavery.
There is optimism in We Could Fly with its soaring vocals
“searching for the promised land”.
By contrast the driving hip-hop influenced rhythms of Better
Get It Right the First Time describe a racist police killing like
that of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, which sparked the Black
Lives Matter movement.
Her music remains rooted in the Piedmont blues style of North
Carolina, with the banjo and other acoustic stringed instruments
featuring prominently. It is augmented in some of these songs with
electric guitar, percussion and wind instruments too. Just as the
themes of the songs cover more than two centuries of the
African-American experience so the music has folk, blues, jazz, rap
and funk influences, all topped with Giddens’s amazing soprano voice.
Rhiannon Giddens has set out to create an album which speaks to
the need to resist in the US today. As the title track has it, “We’re
marching the freedom highway, and we’re not going to turn around.”
Giddens wrote about this track:
“We cannot let hate divide us; we cannot let ignorance
diminish us; we cannot let those whose greed fills their every waking
hour take our country from us. They can’t take US from US â
unless we let them. I recorded this with Bhi Bhiman, all-American
singer-songwriter from St Louis, whose parents are from Sri Lanka.
America’s strength is her people, whether they came 4,000, 400 or
40 years ago, and we can’t leave anyone behind. Let’s walk down
Freedom Highway together.”
 



Tributes have been paid from across the trade union and labour
movement to Dave Gibson, an inspiring revolutionary socialist for
nearly half a century, who has died aged 67.
From school strikes in his teens to Freedom Riders in his 60s,
Dave was a driving force who always led from the front.
Only a few comrades leave an indelible mark on the world – Dave
was one of them. And he always had a twinkle in his eye, laughing at
the absurdities of capitalism and those who run it.
A lifelong socialist, Dave was an exemplary trade unionist and
anti-racist activist.
Dave was a leading figure in the school strikes movement as a
sixth former in Leeds in the late 1960s.
He recalled “I remember the slogans ‘Head Autocracy Out’ and
‘Smash the Bourgeoisie’.”
After joining the International Socialists, forerunner of the SWP,
around 1968 he was sent to Barnsley in 1972 to build the organisation
– and remained a guiding light there at the heart of the struggle
for 40 years.
Dave was central to building solidarity for the miners’ strikes
of 1972, 1974 and 1984-5 and steelworkers in 1980. He was election
agent for a Troops Out of Ireland candidate challenging Barnsley MP
and Northern Ireland minister Roy Mason in the 1979 general election.
More recently he stood as a TUSC candidate.
His record on fighting racism and fascism, from beating back the
National Front in the 1970s and 1980s, the BNP in the 1990s or the
EDL more recently, was second to none.
Dave, UCU branch secretary at Barnsley College for many years,
fought off victimisation twice – the first over the price of a stamp!
As Barnsley TUC secretary and a former UCU lecturers’ union
national executive member, Dave played a leading role in countless
campaigns both international and local – including organising a
film showing of Miners Shot Down about the massacred Marikana
miners in South Africa and supporting the Kinsley 3 sacked cleaners.
And of course, he came up with the idea for the victorious Freedom
Riders campaign against cuts in travel passes for pensioners and
disabled people.
Dave’s UCU comrade Sean Vernell said, “Leadership for Dave was
about inspiring others to fight. At the core of his being lay the
belief that only working people through their own struggles had the
ability to rid society of all its injustices and found society anew
based on equality for all.”
Former UCU president Liz Lawrence said Dave “got closer than
many of us” in meeting Trotsky’s definition of the moral
qualities of Bolshevism as “self-renunciation, audacity and
contempt for every kind of tinsel and falsehood”.
Dave always gently and patiently explained the way forward with
wit and wisdom. It’s hard to believe we’ll never hear again those
lilting Edinburgh tones – mixed with a bit of Barnsley.
South Yorkshire SWP comrades send love and condolences to Dave’s
partner Kate and his stepdaughter Christie.
 



Exhibition – Yorkshire Sculpture Park, Until 2 November
Some 25 years after the Tiananmen Square democracy protests,
Yorkshire Sculpture Park is staging an exhibition by dissident
Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. In his words, “Freedom of speech ... is
the very essence of human rights”, and his work explores freedom
and its restriction in capitalist societies.
The park is in the grounds of Bretton Hall, and this exhibition is
showing in its newly restored 18th century chapel.
Because Ai Weiwei’s personal freedom is so restricted by the
Chinese state, he had to communicate how he wanted to use the chapel
space by email. He has filled the main part with nine rows of five
antique Qing dynasty chairs, all facing in the same direction, in
regimented order. Each chair is isolated from its neighbours. We are
invited to sit on one and think freely.
The setting evokes separation and limited opportunities of
movement but also creates the spirit of the group and also the
importance of the individual within it.
As a printed quotation from the artist says, “Creativity is the
power to act [and] only through our actions can our expectations for
change turn into reality.”
Similar themes recur in his 2008 Map of China sculpture.
Made of wood, its height emphasises China’s long history. It
comprises many separate, distinctively grained pieces of wood
elaborately interlocked to make a unified whole – just like China
is a mosaic of fragments of cultural and ethnic diversity. But the
flat smooth surface suggests how the Chinese state has tried to
suppress this diversity.
Another exhibit is a delicate porcelain sculpture from 2012 called
Ruyi (meaning “as one wishes”) which reworks an ancient
Chinese idea of a ritual sceptre giving the right to speak.
But this ruyi is contained in glass, is fragile and
comprises, in part, human organs with severed arteries. The symbolism
is clear but there are also dragon elements within the sculpture
which encapsulate the potential power of unified action.
Outside the gallery is the most striking of all Ai Weiwei’s
works here. His six metre tall Iron Tree is made up of 97 iron
castings of pieces from different parts of trees, visibly bolted
together and already rusting. It is both jointed and disjointed.
It looks like wood and feels like iron. There is both the power of
nature and people’s collective power to transform nature symbolised
here. It evokes Frankenstein’s creature, as a thing of strange
beauty to be admired rather than a monster to be despised.
As Ai Weiwei has said, “Creativity is the power to reject the
past, to change the status quo and to seek new potential.”
 



A Terrible Unrest
by Philip Duke
Top Hat Books, Â£12.99
There is a plaque on the wall of a house in Loutra, near Rethymnon
in Crete, commemorating the birthplace of Louis Tikas, one of the
leaders of the 11,000 Colorado miners on strike in 1913–14 against
the Rockefeller-owned Colorado Fuel and Iron Company.
Tikas was murdered in cold blood by the Colorado National Guard on
20 April 1914 as part of what has become known as the Ludlow Massacre.
A Terrible Unrest by Philip Duke is a historical novel
published for the centenary of the massacre. It tells the story of
the strike. The novel is a worthy tribute to Tikas and to the bravery
of the miners.
Duke combines historical figures and events with fictional
characters. In so doing, he creates a powerful retelling of the
strike where the narrative drives the reader on, even though the
story is already known.
Much of the narrative centres on a Cretan immigrant family, the
Andrakises. We learn of how brutal life was in the company-owned
towns, the conditions that led to the strike and the way the union
organised, largely through the experiences of the Andrakises and
their friends.
This works well in showing what life was like for the strikers and
their families in the Ludlow Colony. Duke handles the differences of
opinion between strikers, their families and their union leaders
sympathetically.
He describes effectively how Rockefeller’s Colorado henchmen set
out to crush the miners’ union, and how they were able to use the
sheriffs, the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency and even the state
governor and the National Guard to try and break the miners’ resolve.
Duke shows the miners defending themselves but that, even when
that is with weapons, the state is always better armed and more
violent. His depiction of how events unfold on the day of the Ludlow
massacre is particularly memorable.
The novel is at its best when it focuses on the mining community.
But Duke’s attempts to tell the story from the viewpoint of a range
of ruling class figures are less successful.
His biggest weakness is that he does not do justice to the
possibilities for solidarity action as news of the massacre spread.
There is no sense of the insurrectionary mood in Southern Colorado
or the potential for a national solidarity strike and the failure of
the unions to act on that mood.
For a novelist to claim to be “as historically accurate as
possible” that is a failing. Nonetheless, this novel deserves a
wide readership. Some 100 years ago Upton Sinclair was so enraged at
what happened in this strike that he wrote King Coal. Philip
Duke’s novel will help get a new generation equally as enraged.
 



The sight of militant pensioners and disabled people wearing
Freedom Rider T-shirts while noisily protesting is now commonplace
across South Yorkshire.
For the last nine months the South Yorkshire Freedom Riders have
been fighting to get free train travel reinstated for older and
disabled people.
The Labour-dominated South Yorkshire Passenger Transport
Executive’s (SYPTE) decision to axe free travel from 31 March 2014
because of Tory spending cuts, and to do so with extremely limited
public consultation, provoked a storm of outrage.
Over 300 people came to the first Barnsley protest meeting.
That led to what became the South Yorkshire Freedom Riders,
uniting older and disabled people, starting a campaign of
demonstrations on the streets and inside Barnsley Transport
Interchange, and of going on Freedom Rides – travelling by train
and refusing to pay.
From the beginning the campaign sought trade union support. On the
second Freedom Ride the train driver put campaigners in touch with
Aslef who have been a mainstay of support ever since.
The bakers’ union produced the campaign banner, while the South
Yorkshire Unite Community branch has given tremendous backing
throughout. Union donations keep flowing in.
This connection has been a two-way process with Freedom Riders
joining an RMT demonstration and supporting their campaign to keep
guards on trains, and joining the March for the NHS when it came
through Barnsley.
Labour reacted in two ways: by looking to make concessions which
they hoped would divide the protest movement and by attacking the
very idea of protest.
The Barnsley Central MP, Dan Jarvis, shadow justice minister,
denounced the protesters as lawbreakers whose actions were making a
settlement harder. Yet on the streets campaigners got strong public
backing for the protests.
Meanwhile from early June Labour reinstated full rights to free
train travel for disabled people, with older people getting half
fares on some journeys. This divisive proposal was unanimously
rejected by the Freedom Riders at a mass campaign rally in Barnsley’s
main square. Both older and disabled protesters resolved to fight on together.
From that point on the Freedom Rides were met much more
aggressively by Northern Rail and the Transport Police. The crunch
came on 23 June when about 60 Freedom Riders were kettled by
transport police at Sheffield station, with two pensioners arrested
and charged with obstructing the police and not having a valid ticket
for travel. Their trial, scheduled to last five days, starts at
Sheffield Magistrates Court on Monday 8 December.
Campaigners hope that the trial and demonstration will mark the
beginning of a new phase of mass militant protest.
The South Yorkshire experience, whatever the outcome, shows what
pensioners can achieve by militant collective action. That lesson is
likely to be invaluable in the struggles to come.
Update: The case against the Barnsley Freedom Riders was
dropped by the Crown Prosecution Services on Friday 28 November.
 



This month marks the centenary of the Ludlow Massacre when US
national guardsmen killed 20 striking miners and their families in
Colorado. This is the story of one of the most violent episodes in
American labour history.
On 20 April 1914 the US National Guard attacked a tent colony of
striking miners at Ludlow in Southern Colorado. By the end of the day
at least 20 strikers, their wives and children were dead. Thirteen
had died in a pit dug underneath a tent where they were sheltering
from the gunfire after the militiamen deliberately set fire to the tents.
Louis Tikas, a strike leader of Greek origin, and two other
strikers were murdered in cold blood after they were summoned to a
“negotiation” by Lieutenant Linderfelt of the National Guard.
Linderfelt knocked out the unarmed Tikas by breaking his rifle butt
over his skull and then ordered the shooting.
An eyewitness was reported in the New York World as saying,
“The militiamen aimed their rifles and fired into the unconscious
man's body. It was the first murder I had ever seen.”
This slaughter, better known as the Ludlow Massacre, was the most
violent incident in a 14-month long strike of 11,000 coal miners in
Southern Colorado. The US labour historian Howard Zinn described the
strike as “one of the most dramatic and violent examples of class
conflict in American history”.
At least 75 people died in the strike. The strikers, members of
the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), were pitted against the
richest man in the world, John D Rockefeller Jr, who owned the
largest mining company, the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (CFIC).
The miners had many grievances which fuelled the strike. The
Southern Colorado coalfield had the worst safety record in the world.
Rockefeller was vehemently anti-union and in 1912 alone over 1,000
miners were sacked as suspected union members.
Rockefeller had deliberately imported foreign labour to ensure a
mixture of nationalities at every mine in an attempt to keep the
miners divided. In a speech to a union conference in September 1913
the veteran UMWA organiser Mother Jones quoted a CFIC mine manager as
saying, “Dagos are cheaper than props,” in dismissing criticisms
of the company's safety record. She commented, “There are no dagos
in this country. It is the game that has been played down the history
of the ruling class to divide the working class.”
Most of the miners lived in what were effectively feudal mine
camps where the company owned everything. The mine superintendent was
mayor and outsiders were denied entrance. The company owned the shops
and saloons and appointed the marshal. Mine guards were employed to
control the miners. They controlled state and sheriff elections too.
CFIC Colorado manager L.M. Bowers described his company as “the
political dictator of Southern Colorado”.
 
Machine Guns
While UMWA officials sought a negotiated settlement prior to the
strike, the coal operators prepared for war. They paid for hundreds
of gunmen and detectives of the Baldwin-Felts Agency to be deputised
and brought in up to 20 machine guns. Detectives from the agency shot
dead a UMWA organiser, Gerald Lippiatt, in Trinidad, the main town in
the mining area.
The 11,000 miners walked out on 23 September 1913 demanding union
recognition, an eight hour day, a 10 percent pay rise and, most
significantly, for the state mining laws to be enforced in the
Southern Colorado mines. The miners and their families moved into
giant tent colonies as the coal operators would evict them from the
company camps. Ludlow was the biggest with 1,200 people living there.
The unity and resolve of the miners were unbreakable despite every
effort of the coal operators and their hired guns, who even paid for
an armoured vehicle, nicknamed the “Death Special” to shoot up
tent colonies with machine guns. The first time it was used one boy
was hit nine times in the leg and a striker was killed. The miners
fought back with what few arms they had.
Bowers agitated for the National Guard to be called in. He told
Rockefeller he had got the backing of “all the bankers of the city
... the chamber of commerce, the real estate exchange, a great many
of the best businessmen ... [backed by] 14 of the editors of the most
important newspapers in the state.” That was sufficient to force
the state governor to do as Bowers wished.
The miners believed that the National Guard would be neutral. They
were quickly disillusioned. The commanding officer, General Chase,
drove around in a CFIC vehicle. He created what he called the
“military district of Colorado” arresting hundreds of miners and
their wives. Mother Jones was held without charge for months.
The coal operators had hoped that the arrival of the National
Guard would break the resolve of the strikers. When this failed they
agitated for the National Guard to oversee the mass importation of
scab labour. Eventually the governor agreed, so trainloads of strike
breakers started arriving, protected by the National Guard, so much
so that the women taunted them, calling them “scab herders”.
These men did not know they were to be used as strike breakers
until they arrived at Ludlow rail junction. Some who protested were
killed. They were held prisoner by armed guards in the mine camps.
Those who did manage to escape found refuge in the tent colonies.
The salaries of the guardsmen were effectively being paid by the
coal operators. As the money dried up most of the guards were
recalled at the end of March, leaving just three companies, made up
primarily of mine-guards and agency detectives. The company at Ludlow
was commanded by Lieutenant Linderfelt, a man who had established his
brutal credentials in November when he savagely attacked Louis Tikas
and had him jailed.
The attack on the Ludlow tent colony began early on 20 April.
Three machine guns fired into the tents, backed up by 400 armed men.
The miners fought back as best they could with the limited arms
available to them but could not stop the onslaught.
Union railwaymen refused to transport National Guard
reinforcements to Ludlow in the form of an armoured train until
eventually a scab crew was found. The colony was burnt to the ground
and it was not until the fires were put out the following day that
the 13 dead were found beneath the tents.
A conservative newspaper, the Rocky Mountain News,
commented, “Machine guns did the murder. It was private war, with
the wealth of the richest man in the world behind the armed guards.”
The New York Times said, “No situation can justify the acts
of the militia” and fretted that their blunder would give
justification to whatever the miners did in response.
The brutality of the massacre sent shockwaves through the American
working class. The striking miners were enraged and armed men from
other tent colonies poured into the Ludlow area, attacking the
working mines, driving off the guards and dynamiting them. They were
backed by other local workers taking up arms, including clerks and
teachers. Railway workers continued to refuse to transport troops and
ammunition to Ludlow.
In Wyoming 1,700 miners took up arms and told the UMWA they were
ready to go to Ludlow, while in Cripple Creek 500 miners headed for
Ludlow. The Denver Cigar Makers Union voted to send 500 armed men.
 
Demonstrators
Solidarity donations poured into Ludlow. From September 1913 to
April 1914 $8,700 had been donated; in the three weeks following the
massacre this rose to $80,000. In Denver 5,000 demonstrated to demand
that the National Guard officers be put on trial for murder and
branded the governor as an accessory. Demonstrators hounded
Rockefeller in New York.
A group of 82 guardsmen mutinied in Denver and refused to board a
troop train bound for Ludlow because they did not want to kill women
and children. Eugene Debs, leader of the US Socialist Party, said;
“The shots fired at Ludlow ... will prove the signal for the
American revolution.” Debs, who had received over 900,000 votes in
the US presidential elections two years earlier, called for the
setting up of a Gunmen’s Defence Fund to ensure that the strikers
had the firepower to match that of the guards.
UMWA locals all over the country demanded the union call a
national strike. Such a strike could have had huge support, have
sparked widespread solidarity strikes and the coal operators could
have been beaten. But UMWA officials argued that the best way to
support the strike was to stay at work.
When President Wilson sent in federal troops nine days after the
massacre union officials effectively stopped resistance. The strike
was not finally called off until December but it had been beaten when
the national union leaders failed to escalate the strike.
The Ludlow Massacre showed that the US ruling class was willing to
use any means to defeat workers (it would enter the First World War
three years later in the name of “democracy” and “freedom”).
But the Ludlow strike also shows that America’s rulers were not all powerful.
If the bravery of the 11,000 strikers and their families fighting
the richest man in the world and his private army had been matched by
bravery from their union leaders this could have been a famous
working class victory. As it was, it took another generation before
the Southern Colorado coalfield was finally unionised.
 



Pete Seeger died in January aged 94. His life was dedicated to
making music for left wing progressive movements. He was a principled
brave musician who always stood by his beliefs, whatever the cost.
Seeger composed famous protest songs like If I Had a Hammer
and helped make We Shall Overcome an anthem of the civil
rights movement. He sang at the 2012 Occupy Wall Street protest just
like he had at anti Vietnam War and civil rights rallies.
When he was 17, Seeger went with his Communist father to hear
Bascom Lamar Lunsford play the 5-string banjo at a folk festival.
From that point on he adopted the instrument. He spent more time
playing the banjo than studying and he joined the Young Communist
League, dropping out of Harvard University.
His musical activism started in 1939 when he joined the Vagabond
Puppeteers’ tour of upstate New York. They performed at picket
lines of the Dairy Farmers’ Union who were striking for better
prices from milk wholesalers.
A defining moment in Seeger’s life came in 1940 when he played a
“Grapes of Wrath” benefit concert in New York for Californian
migrant workers. Also on the bill was Woody Guthrie and before long
Seeger was travelling west with Guthrie, singing at strike rallies
and learning his music craft.
Seeger learned fast and by 1941 he had set up the Almanac Singers,
which Guthrie joined later. It was a musical collective, where they
attempted to build the movement in the spirit of John L. Lewis,
leader of the United Mineworkers, who said “A singing army is a
winning army”.
Their first album, Songs for John Doe, was anti-war at a
time when the Communist Party was anti-war because of the
Stalin-Hitler pact. Their second, Talking Union, supported the
industrial struggle. When Hitler invaded the Soviet Union they
rapidly reversed their positions, becoming pro-war and anti-strikes.
But despite this U-turn the Almanacs were blacklisted because of
their earlier positions.
For the following 25 years Seeger was a victim of the
anti-Communist witch-hunt whipped up in the US. His next band, The
Weavers, disbanded in 1952 (after selling 4 million records in 1950)
because they were blacklisted and hounded by FBI agents. Their
recording of Rock Island Line was even investigated for
sedition by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee.
The witch-hunt peaked in September 1949 when racist gangs attacked
a Paul Robeson concert at Peekskill, near New York. At the concert
Seeger gave one of the earliest performances of If I Had a Hammer.
As he drove home with his family the police diverted all traffic down
a narrow high-sided road into a violent ambush by a racist mob. The
Seegers’ car windows were smashed by rocks.
Seeger was called in front of the House Un-American Activities
Committee in 1955. He refused to answer any questions. He was held in
contempt but it was another six years before he was sentenced to a
year’s imprisonment. The sentence was later overturned on appeal.
Throughout those years his freedom of movement was restricted.
He was blacklisted from TV until 1967 when he was invited onto the
nationally networked Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. Even then
CBS edited out his anti-Vietnam War song.
State repression did not stop his activism. He helped transform We
Shall Overcome from a union song into one that Martin Luther King
described as a “song that haunts you”. It became for a time the
anthem of the civil rights movement.
But Seeger’s music was also criticised from the left. Malcolm X
said, “I’m not one who goes for We Shall Overcome ... If
you’re going to get yourself a .45 and start singing We Shall
Overcome, I’m with you.” Writer Lillian Hellman called it
“namby-pamby, wishy-washy”. By comparison to the political
toughness of Dylan’s Times They Are A’Changing album, much
of Seeger’s music appeared soft and liberal.
Similar criticisms had been raised of Seeger since the time of The
Weavers. They had performed at a segregated club in Detroit, they
dressed formally and their music had lost its rough edges. Seeger’s
1960s hit Little Boxes was a tame attack on conformity.
Performing in Israel in 1967 he even tried to bring Palestinian
refugees together with Israeli kibbutzniks at his concert, with
predictably disastrous results.
Yet Seeger’s significance is that he continued through very
tough times to put his beliefs into song, and to use song to bring
people together into activity. His father Charles argued that making
music as a group activity was “the essential thing” and his son
put that belief into practice throughout his life.
 



John Steinbeck’s powerful drama of the Great Depression, gets a
wonderful staging in this production [West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds].
Steinbeck’s story of Californian migrant farm workers resonates
today, whether it is with Chinese cockle-pickers or workers on
zero-hours contracts.
Dyfrig Morris is sensational as Lennie, convincingly conveying
both his physical strength and his child-like simplicity.
Lennie and George are characters who share dreams of independence
which inspire their fellow workers.
This thought-provoking production, which I’d recommend anyone to
see, is intensified throughout by the original use of music.
 



The Threepenny Opera
by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill
Nottingham Playhouse
German dramatist Bertolt Brecht wrote this musical in 1928 during
a capitalist crisis. This production updates it with modern
references, even including Jimmy Savile.
Boss Peachum (Garry Robson) makes money out of organising begging,
and knows “the beggar, the banker, the cop are all on the take.”
Main villain MacHeath (Milton Lopes) wants to move into banking,
because there is “less danger, more profits.”
Peachum sees his daughter Polly (CiCi Howells) as a business
asset, as does MacHeath, and the two struggle to control her. But
Polly too is coldly calculating.
Brecht’s target is the corruption of capitalist society. Crime
doesn’t just pay – it’s indistinguishable from business.
The production is fast and funny with strong acting and singing
performances.
Enhanced by words and images on overhead screens, Brecht’s
satirical songs savage bourgeois morality.
 



Hans Fallada’s 1947 novel Alone in Berlin is set in the
German capital during the Second World War. It tells the intertwined
stories of families living in an apartment block and trying to cope
with the Nazis’ terror regime. Fallada shows ordinary people both
resisting the Nazis and working for them, in a myriad of different ways.
The couple at the centre of the novel, Otto and Anna Quangel, are
grief-stricken by their son’s death while fighting in France, and
their grief quickly turns to determined resistance to the regime.
Every week they produce postcards displaying anti-Nazi slogans and
over a two-year period distribute them around the city in office
stairwells. Their resistance is strengthened by the mistreatment of a
Jewish neighbour and by dislike of the Nazi family who live on the
floor above.
Alongside the Quangels’ story Fallada tells that of the Gestapo
police inspector trying to hunt them down. The terror is all
consuming. Not just the hunted, but some of the hunters, and those
who seek to profit from the Nazi persecution of working people, are
destroyed. Yet however terrifying the state terror apparatus is,
Fallada extracts dark humour from its frequent, blundering and myopic failures.
Throughout the novel, despite the huge network of police spies and
Nazi agents, there are examples of individuals looking for ways to
fight back. We see, among others, members of an opposition factory
cell, a widowed shopkeeper, a retired judge and a Christian
technician make brave stands against tyranny.
Otto is a foreman in a furniture factory which “ironically”
has been converted to coffin manufacturing. At one point the
omniscient narrator tells us that “there is not one among the 80
men [present on Otto’s shift] who has not in some way opposed the
present government”. Yet the impact of the terror is such that most
individuals feel isolated and act alone.
Worse still, the widespread fear limits the effect of any
rebellion. Most of the Quangels’ postcards are handed in to the
authorities by people terrified of being implicated themselves. The
narrator shows us a doctor in just such a state, yet significantly
his fear stems from hoping that his own act of defiance will remain concealed.
Fallada is unsparing in his portrait of Nazi brutality and how
they break resistance with violence and interrogation. There is an
inevitability to the failure of resistance.
But the novel celebrates that resistance. As one character says:
“We all acted alone, we were caught alone, and ... will ... die
alone. But that doesn’t mean we are alone or ... our deaths will be
in vain.” There is hope in that, and in the fact that “at least
you opposed evil”.
There is further hope in the portrayal of the central characters,
both in their determination to hit back against Nazi tyranny, and the
way that resistance strengthens and changes them. A supreme moment
demonstrating this is when Otto laughs in the face of a brutal Nazi
judge, defying the worst the system can throw at him.
Fallada uses the narrator to tell us that the novel is dedicated
to “invincible life ... triumphing over humiliation and tears, over
misery and death”. The book is both a chilling portrayal of the
triumph of barbarism and a tribute to the anti-Nazi resistance of
many ordinary Germans.
 



Fences
Directed by Paulette Randall
Duchess Theatre, 3–5 Catherine Street, London WC2B 5LA
Lenny Henry is a revelation as Troy Maxson, a former star of the
segregated baseball leagues whose life is blighted by racism.
In Pittsburgh in 1957 “the hot winds of change had not yet begun
to blow full”.
Bitter at a career thwarted by racism, he is now a refuse worker.
He has demanded the right to be a driver – a white only job.
But his bitterness and parental protectiveness make him deny his
son Cory his own chance at sporting success and a college education.
This is a new production of African American writer August
Wilson’s play first produced in 1983.
 



All my sons
Talawa Theatre Company – Royal Exchange Manchester
This new staging of Arthur Miller’s powerful early play All
My Sons is gripping throughout. Don Warrington conveys the
complexities of Miller’s central characterâthe corrupt, lying
arms manufacturer Joe Keller.
He is supported by strong performances, most notably Dona Kroll as
Joe’s wife Kate. The Kellers’ family life takes centre stage, and
gradually an exploration of corruption and business emerges.
Kate is in denial about the death of her son Larry in the Second
World War, and opposes her other son Chris’s decision to marry
Larry’s ex-fiancée, Ann. Ann’s father is prison because Joe
wrongly blamed him for a faulty batch of cylinder heads that caused
fatal plane crashes.
The play highlights the immorality of capitalism, where profit is
more important than human life. And it shows why Talawa fully
deserves to be such a prominent black-led theatre company.
