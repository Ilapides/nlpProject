Andr&#233; Beaufre<br />

<p class="fst"><strong>Annihilation and Utopia</strong><br />
Errol E. Harris<br />
<em>Allen &amp; Unwin, 45s.</em></p>

<p class="fst">I am writing this review during Mental Health Week, with grave personal doubts about my own sanity. My difficulties began when I read Mr Beaufre on the prospect that politicians might &#8216;humanise nuclear war&#8217; (p.76). Matters grew worse as he told me about those benighted and befuddled individuals who want nuclear disarmament; as Mr Beaufre says, &#8216;they could not be more wrong&#8217; (p.98). Then, when he told me of the necessity of countries threatening each other with weapons of mass destruction &#8211; &#8216;multilateral deterrence&#8217; was his snappy phrase &#8211; continuing right into the 21st century, I relapsed into permanent paranoia.</p>

<p>Mr Beaufre is one the gentlemen, like Mr Kahn, who has worked out the moves and counter-moves of nuclear confrontation along lines similar to a game of chess. Unfortunately, it is, by its very nature, a game that contestants will only play once. The dangers are uppermost in Mr Harris&#8217;s mind. He writes clearly and persuasively about the almost certain annihilation that would be triggered off by a nuclear war, even if started in a limited way. He sees, as the alternative to disaster, mutual compromise and the creation of an international world order.</p>
