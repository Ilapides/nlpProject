<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/sw-gb/1969/index.html#n0111" target="new">No. 111</a>, 1 March 1969, p.&nbsp;3.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">IT IS EXTREMELY gracious of Mr. Sid Bidwell MP to explain that Mrs. Renee Short cannot be accurately described as &lsquo;a Left-wing Labour MP&rsquo; (January 4). But the big question is: can Mr. Bidwell?</p>

<p>Before he writes to <strong>Socialist Worker</strong> about the Honourable Lady Member for Wolverhampton, I think he should explain some of his own racialist effusions.</p>

<p>Was the Sid Bidwell who voted for the Bill excluding Kenyan Asians from Britain solely on grounds of colour the same person, who wrote in <strong>Socialist Review</strong> of January 1956 arguing that people should be free to leave and enter Britain as they pleased?</p>

<p>In that article, he wrote: &lsquo;There are some trade unionists who actually argue that there should be a difference between the attitude to be taken to the black worker who comes from the &ldquo;Empire and Commonwealth&rdquo; and the foreign worker. What kind of international trade union solidarity is this?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, Mr. Bidwell! What &lsquo;solidarity&rsquo; can you espouse today when you back the government&rsquo;s immigration policy, a policy that is based precisely on making the distinction between those with white and black skins.</p>
