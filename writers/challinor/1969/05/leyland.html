<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/sw-gb/1969/index.html#n0123" target="new">No. 123</a>, 22 May 1969, p.&nbsp;4.<br />

<p class="fst">THE FIRST STRIKE for more than 40 years is taking place at British Leyland motor factories in mid-Lancashire. All five works with 8,500 men are out.</p>

<p>Convenor Len Brindle said, &lsquo;You could hear the swish of hands going up when we put the resolution.&rsquo; The men&rsquo;s demand is for parity of earnings with the rest of the group.</p>

<p>They call for &pound;24 a week for a skilled man &ndash; &pound;10 less than many are getting in Midlands&rsquo; car factories.</p>

<p>One striker pointed out &lsquo;This is the Hong Kong of the British Leyland group. Judas sold himself for 30 pieces of silver. He would only get 10 here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Another brought out a newspaper cutting showing that lavatory attendants at Pressed Steel were receiving &pound;5 a week more than skilled men at Leylands.</p>

<p>The management have enjoyed a prolonged period of &lsquo;good labour relations&rsquo;. For many years the trade unions, with right-wing leadership, have been pliable and docile. As a result there has been hard work and low pay.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Contempt</h4>

<p class="fst">But the management has shown it has not appreciated this co-operative attitude. In the present negotiations it has shown nothing except contempt for the joint shop stewards&rsquo; committee.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&lsquo;All we want,&rsquo; says Len Brindle, &lsquo;is parity of earnings &ndash; dignity for those on piecework.&rsquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">British Leyland claim that to grant the men&rsquo;s demands would cost the company &pound;600,000. The strikers think this, is an exaggeration but say that if it were true the is peanuts compared with the giant combine&rsquo;s profits.</p>

<p>And if the figure of &pound;600,000 is correct, it only shows how much below &pound;24 a week skilled men at Leyland are getting.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Contrast</h4>

<p class="fst">Vin Murphy, vice-chairman of the stewards&rsquo; committee, contrasted the shabby treatment they were receiving with the directors&rsquo; rake-off.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;Top management has devised a scheme that gives them thousands of pounds extra for each one of them,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;The productivity schemes that have been suggested to us have not been half so generous.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">There are signs that British Leyland is digging in its heels. The feeling is that it may be a long struggle, but the solidarity of the men is tremendous.</p>
