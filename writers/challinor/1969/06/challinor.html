<p class="fst">LEYLAND, Tuesday:&ndash; As 12 representatives from the British Leyland strike committee journey to York for talks to end the month-old strike of 8500 workers at the five Lancashire plants, the management must be ruefully considering their predicament.</p>

<p>The determination of the workers to fight for a decent wage has been a great shock to them. Added to that determination are hard financial facts.</p>

<p>The effects of the strike are starting to hurt.</p>

<p>British Leyland is losing &pound;1,200,000 a week and the shortage of spare parts produced in Lancashire is growing worse and hitting their customers.</p>

<p>Albion Motors in Glasgow is losing &pound;450,000 a week and Jaguar in, the Midlands &pound;320,000.</p>

<p>The money is starting to roll into the strike fund. Contributions are coming from all sections of the community, ranging from old age pensioners to even the company&rsquo;s foremen.</p>

<p><em>But the most important contribution is from the other workers in the British Leyland combine who are giving an hour&rsquo;s pay each week.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Demands</h4>

<p class="fst">As the strike enters its fifth week no one has attempted to cross the picket line.</p>

<p>They are determined to win their demands of &pound;24 a week for skilled piece workers, parity of bonus for women and &pound;18&nbsp;10s for new starters. The present flat rate is &pound;14 for a skilled man.</p>

<p>At the last mass meeting, strikers&rsquo; morale was high. The vote to stay out was unanimous. At the same time there were shouts of &lsquo;Bring them all out&rsquo; &ndash; meaning the rest of the 200,000 workers in the British Leyland combine.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Parity</h4>

<p class="fst">And the demand for parity with the Midlands appears to be growing. Colin Fishwick, a leading shop steward, chaired the meeting and put a resolution on parity.</p>

<p>It was carried almost unanimously.</p>

<p>Len Brindle, the convenor, said, &lsquo;Our position is strengthening. We go to York determined to make no concessions.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Another steward said: &lsquo;The toughest battle will be at 9.30&nbsp;a.m. at York on Wednesday when we meet the full-time officials. The fight with the management is secondary.&rsquo;</p>
