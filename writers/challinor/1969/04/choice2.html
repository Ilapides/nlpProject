<h4>Man of few words</h4>

<p class="fst">CAPITALISM APPEARS to be speeding up everything, with the exception of wage negotiations. These are usually marooned for months amid muddy procedures &ndash; arbitration, conciliation, courts of inquiry, and other damn things &ndash; all carefully calculated to delay the worker a rise as long as possible.</p>

<p>Militants, fretful about such delays, should re-tell the story of the late Herbert Smith, the old Yorkshire miners&rsquo; leader. He was the Speedy Gonzales of pay claims. His fastest negotiation was conducted as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><strong>Herbert Smith</strong> (putting his head round the comer of the boss&rsquo;s door): &lsquo;Owt?&rsquo;</p>

<p class="quoteb"><strong>Boss:</strong> &lsquo;Nowt!&rsquo;</p>

<p class="quoteb"><strong>Herbert Smith:</strong> &lsquo;We&rsquo;re out.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">The strike was won. Herbert Smith proudly recounted this episode to union officials whom he believed were insufficiently belligerent towards the bosses.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a name="pt2"></a>
<h4>Explosive reaction</h4>

<p class="fst">AS YOU SEND your contribution to the Socialist Worker Fighting Fund, you may be interested to hear about the response to a previous call for financial assistance.</p>

<p>The author, Wilfred Scawen Blunt, wrote in his diary for February 19, 1905: &lsquo;George Meredith has been appealing for funds to help the revolution in Russia, and I have subscribed &pound;10.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then Blunt added: &lsquo;Yesterday came news that the Grand Duke Serge has been blown up with a bomb, so I am subscribing again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alas, <strong>Socialist Worker</strong> cannot claim to have instigated the bumping off of any grand dukes &ndash; they are so hard to come by these days &ndash; but, nevertheless, I am sure it will use all contributions to the utmost effect.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<a name="pt3"></a>
<h4>A dangerous game</h4>

<p class="fst">THE INSTITUTE for Workers Control bulletin, specially issued for the recent Sheffield conference, contains a contribution from Danny McGarvey of the Boilermakers&rsquo; Union.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to hear from the Institute precisely how it considers Mr McGarvey is furthering the cause of workers&rsquo; control.</p>

<p>Did the agreement he reached at Fairfield shipyard on the Clyde, where he signed away many precious rights of the men, promote the cause of workers control?</p>

<p>Or could he be said to be advancing the interests of the rank and file when he sat on the notorious Cameron inquiry, which knifed the shop stewards&rsquo; organisation at the Barbican building site in London?</p>

<h4>*</h4>
<a name="pt4"></a>

<p class="fst">By publishing the left-wing phrases of trade union bureaucrats like McGarvey, while doing nothing to criticise their right-wing deeds, the Institute for Workers&rsquo; Control is playing a dangerous game.</p>

<p>Its role could easily become similar to the Anglo-Russian trade union committees of 1925, a body that gave a tinge of red to the TUC and so made its betrayal of the general strike in the following year all the more easy to carry out.</p>
