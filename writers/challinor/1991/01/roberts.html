<h1>Wrong on Roberts</h1>

<p class="fst">THAT ubiquitous correspondent Keith Flett is wrong (November <strong>SWR</strong>). He has not understood the main thrust of W.P. Roberts&#8217; argument against registration under the Trades Union Act 1871. The Miners&#8217; Attorney-General&#8217;s opposition arose because he considered what trade unions were gaining under this new legislation was less than what they were losing.</p>

<p>Keith Flett can look at pre-1871 labour history. The Tolpuddle Martyrs, the Glasgow spinners, the victims of the pitmen&#8217;s Bond &#8211; he will find countless examples of the savagery of the law towards working people. There is, however, one thing he will not find: a trade union being arraigned before the courts. Workers yes, workers&#8217; organisations no.</p>

<p>The reason is quite simple. Pre-1871 unions were located in a limbo land between legality and illegality. They had no legal existence. Like the football crowd at Liverpool&#8217;s Kop, they could neither sue nor be sued as a collective entity.</p>

<p>But the 1871 act altered that. It began a journey that led to Taff Vale, where the NUR&#8217;s forerunner had damages awarded against it because its members had gone on unofficial strike, and ultimately ended up with the sequestration of all the NUM&#8217;s assets during the 1984-5 coal strike.</p>

<p>W.P. Roberts could foresee this harmful development happening. Therefore, he wanted to give as few hostages as possible to judicial misfortune. Presumably, the SWP acts on the same principle today: while having no illusions about the law, still it tries to order its activities so as to minimise the possibility of costly and damaging legal actions occurring.</p>

<p>Through the ages, right wing union leaders have had a rather different approach. One has only to look at the way they now do not want any future Labour government to repeal Thatcher&#8217;s anti-union legislation. It gives them a useful weapon with which to stifle rank and file activity.</p>

<p>Yet the law holds no fears for the union bureaucrats themselves. They may even be rewarded from on high for seeking to maintain &#8216;good&#8217; industrial relations, i.e. tranquil conditions where profit making can continue unimpeded. As an unofficial dockers&#8217; leader ruefully remarked in the 1970s, there were more noble knights on the TUC General Council than ever King Arthur had sitting at his round table at Camelot.</p>

<p>In W.P. Roberts&#8217; times, the union hierarchy was just beginning to emerge, assert itself, establish control over the organisation, dominate the membership. Keith Flett should try to understand this fact dominated Roberts&#8217; attitude to industrial legislation. It aided and abetted a process of differentiation that has led to a situation today where general secretaries of the TUC receive peerages while rank and file union members receive prison sentences.</p>

<p>This may appear quite appropriate to Lord Len Murray; on the other hand, the mass of miners fined and imprisoned may have a slightly different view.</p>
