<p class="fst"><strong>I&#8217;ve Lived Through It All</strong><br />
Emanuel Shinwell<br />
<em>Gollancz, &#163;4.00</em></p>

<p class="fst">THIS BOOK COULD have been sub-titled: <em>And I was responsible for quite a lot of the mess myself</em>. Shinwell tells &#8211; or rather re-tells, for this is his second attempt at autobiography &#8211; how he attacked the Communist Party in 1921, supported the Second International against the Third, moved Ramsay MacDonald for the leadership of the Parliamentary Labour Party, helped as a junior minister in the first minority Labour government to avert a strike of miners, assisted in the organisation of the army to aid the American troops in Korea in 1951, favoured invading Iran when Mossadeq nationalised the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and consistently supported Zionist aggression.</p>

<p>With a record like that, you might have thought Shinwell would have been well-advised to keep quiet. Not a bit of it! Shinwell is proud of what he has done.</p>
