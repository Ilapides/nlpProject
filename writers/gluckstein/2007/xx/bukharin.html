<p class="fst">Nikolai Bukharin<br/>
<strong>Socialism and Its Culture</strong><br/>
<em>Berg, 2007, &#163;16.99</em></p>

<p class="fst">Under normal circumstances any reviewer for this journal would
take one look at Nikolai Bukharin&#8217;s <strong>Socialism and Is Culture</strong>
and consign it to the nearest dustbin. Written at the height of
Joseph Stalin&#8217;s repression, it argues his &#8220;leadership displays a
masterly application of Marxist-Leninist dialectics&#8221;, while any
criticism of the USSR is &#8220;nothing other than a fascist-Trotskyist
calumny&#8221;. So this book could easily be treated as just another
stone in that mountain of trash published by Russian state capitalism
in its heyday. However, it will be my difficult task to suggest that
you reserve judgement, as least for a while.</p>

<p>This manuscript is part of a series of works, including a novel
and philosophical treatise, which Bukharin wrote while awaiting trial
and inevitable execution at Moscow&#8217;s notorious Lubyanka prison. In
the hands of Stalin&#8217;s secret police he was lucky to have any
writing materials at all, and was subject to perpetual interrogation
and psychological torture. The fact that the book is an example of
prison writing is no indication of its quality, yet, if only on a
personal plane, it is of interest.</p>

<p>However, if you are expecting something like Antonio Gramsci&#8217;s
prison writings you will be disappointed. With some reason the
foreword claims that <strong>Socialism and Its Culture</strong> was written
&#8220;with only one reader in mind &#8211; the one on whom Bukharin&#8217;s life
depended, along with the lives of his family members, and the fate of
his manuscripts, their survival or destruction. The book, in effect,
was a long letter to Stalin without the usual salutation &#8216;Dear
Koba&#8217;.&#8221; We do not find the Italian Marxist praising Benito
Mussolini, his jailer, as Bukharin does Stalin: &#8220;a man who has a
magnificent expert knowledge of military literature, military
technology, military organisation, strategy and tactics&#8221;, etc, etc,
etc. To that extent much of this book is patent rubbish (although in
its 226 pages plaudits for Stalin are few and far between, a mere
scattering compared to the conventional eulogy per page of the time).</p>

<p>But rubbish can be very informative (archaeologists tell us), and
this book deserves careful attention. Consider its author. Whatever
he may have written in 1937, Bukharin&#8217;s background meant he was no
ordinary apparatchik. Lenin&#8217;s <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1922/dec/testamnt/index.htm" target="new"><em>Testament</em></a> of 1922 described
him as the Bolshevik&#8217;s &#8220;biggest theoretician&#8221; and the party&#8217;s
&#8220;favourite&#8221;. Bukharin wrote the first systematic treatment of
state capitalism, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1917/imperial/index.htm" target="new"><strong>Imperialism and World Economy</strong></a>, and edited
the Bolshevik&#8217;s daily, <strong>Pravda</strong>, during the early years of the
Russian Revolution. He sided with Stalin against Leon Trotsky&#8217;s
Left Opposition in the faction fight following Lenin&#8217;s death in
1924, but by 1928&#8211;9 Bukharin&#8217;s Right Opposition disagreed with
Stalin&#8217;s forced collectivisation of agriculture. Thus Bukharin led
the last internal party opposition for half a century.</p>

<p>Given the circumstances of its composition, the words used in
<strong>Socialism and Its Culture</strong> cannot be taken at face value,
because the book operates on several levels simultaneously. On one
level it contains a mass of glaring untruths: &#8220;Is there a class
hierarchy in the USSR? No, there is no such hierarchy, because class
distinctions have been erased.&#8221; &#8220;In the USSR ... freedoms are
felt as fact every hour and every day, in all life experience.&#8221;
Although the book ignores the mass labour camps, the famines, the
exploitation and brutal oppression of Stalin&#8217;s regime, it is
important not to slip into Cold War judgements when confronting it.
The McCarthyite right castigated Russia for not imitating Western
capitalism. In complete contrast, Trotsky criticised Russia as an
obstacle to socialism. Ordinary Communists were misguided &#8211; not the enemy.</p>

<p>In <strong>Socialism and Its Culture</strong> Bukharin&#8217;s primary
literary aim was to uphold the idea of socialism against its critics.
In doing so, however, his argument is framed in the following way:
the Soviet Union is presented as the epitome of socialism. To modern
eyes this is a spectacularly peculiar style of argument. However, for
many years equating the USSR with &#8220;actually existing socialism&#8221;
was universal among Communists. In judging their beliefs the question
was what took priority &#8211; defence of the USSR (with socialism as the
spurious justification) or allegiance to socialism (with the USSR
falsely believed to be its embodiment). The answer depended on the
individual. Stalinist hacks fitted the former category, but there
were many real socialists who through ignorance or naivety belonged
in the latter category.</p>

<p>Bukharin was certainly not ignorant, though perhaps naive. If we
cannot answer certainly on which side of the divide he stood, his
book nevertheless gives an invaluable insight into the thinking of
the millions of people who, in the dark days of the 1930s with Nazism
in the ascendant, looked to Russia as a beacon of resistance.</p>
<p>There is still more to <strong>Socialism and Its Culture</strong> than that.
Many of its arguments are relevant in the struggle today. We live in
a world where the bosses want 24/7 working and everything
subordinated to the market. Against this, Bukharin makes a plea for humanism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The most important thing, which must be placed in the
forefront, is the development of the working people themselves ...
socialism is the abolition of exploitation, the fact that &#8216;hired
hands&#8217; are turned into people, the collective creators and
organisers. People working for themselves, conscious makers of their
own &#8216;destiny&#8217;, who genuinely forge their own happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Bukharin discusses a number of contemporary issues such as
national cultures and the &#8220;clash of civilisations&#8221;. Today the
tendency is towards the globalising and flattening of culture through
multinational corporations and US superpower dominance. <strong>Socialism
and Its Culture</strong> makes a plea for preservation and strengthening
of the diversity of cultural life without descending into
parochialism or racism. Internationalism and human unity are achieved
not by suppressing national culture (as capitalism does), but by
creating freedom and real equality between people and cultures. Unity
comes through each person valuing the other&#8217;s difference &#8211; unity
through the expression of diversity.</p>

<p>There is a fascinating discussion of individuality. Bukharin is
answering those who say that under socialism individual difference is
obliterated in a monochrome world of state control. Bukharin shows
how the concept of individuality is historically determined. In
pre-class societies the individual might have existed as a separate
biological entity, but socially people were &#8220;bands or hordes; the
individual as such did not exist at all&#8221;. In ancient societies such
as Egypt it was meaningless to talk about &#8220;the individual in
general&#8221; because there was nothing in common between the
god-Pharoah, the high priest and the slave.</p>

<p>This would eventually change: &#8220;Capitalism unleashed the &#8216;free
individual&#8217;, under which was concealed the free commodity producer
... The individual leapt out upon the historical stage in an
extraordinarily vivid way. The very type of society, that is, this
capitalist society &#8211; anarchic, bound together only by the bonds of
exchange and characterised by the conflict of competition &#8211; brought
this &#8216;free individual&#8217; to the forefront.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bukharin contrasts this with socialism where</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;the growth of one individual brings with it the growth
of another. In capitalist society the bourgeois individual suppressed
the proletarian individual. In socialist society with the growth of
the individual the entire mass rises, that is, all individuals taken
together ... Therefore in capitalist society the growth of the
individual ... is bound up with &#8216;egoism&#8217; and individualism, that
is with characteristics that divide people, that set one individual
apart from another, that oppose one individual to another in a
situation of more or less sharp conflict, psychological hostility and
fragmentation.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;In socialist society, on the contrary, the growth of
the individual causes an ever greater connection ... because this is
accompanied by an ever greater consciousness of the good of the
cause, the aim held in common, the general dependence of the overall
result on the degree of cooperation and harmony.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>Socialism and Its Culture</strong> has equally interesting
discussions on women&#8217;s rights, the environment, hierarchy and
equality, culture and much more. These are powerfully written and
show that the depth of imagination that led Lenin to call Bukharin a
&#8220;big&#8221; theorist was not misplaced.</p>

<p class="fst">Lenin criticised Bukharin for not properly understanding the
dialectic, and Bukharin&#8217;s biography showed how he found it
difficult to accept contradiction &#8211; the interpenetration of
opposites. At crucial moments he would grasp one side of a problem
but not the other. Thus in 1918 he was an ultra-left, emphasising the
need to spread the Russian Revolution internationally without taking
into account the pressing need for the Bolsheviks to consolidate
their fragile hold on power. So he called for revolutionary war when
there was no army to speak of.</p>

<p>In the 1920s, at the time of the New Economic Policy, he swung to
the right and argued that &#8220;socialism in one country was possible
... if we abstract from international factors&#8221;. Trotsky rightly
poked fun at this: &#8220;If we accomplish this &#8216;abstraction&#8217;, then,
of course, the rest is easy. But we cannot ... It is possible to walk
naked in the streets of Moscow in January, if we can abstract
ourselves from the weather and the police.&#8221; In a truly dialectical
twist, Bukharin&#8217;s lack of dialectics turned into a real strength.
The ability to grasp hold of one aspect and follow it through to its
logical conclusion without being troubled by contradictions
contributed to his pioneering <strong>Imperialism and World Economy</strong>,
and it re-emerges in <strong>Socialism and Its Culture</strong>.</p>

<p>Bukharin had witnessed tremendous forces unleashed in 1917, which
gave a vividness and concreteness to socialism which it had never
possessed before (except for a brief moment during the Paris Commune
of 1871). Russia&#8217;s isolation and subsequent counter-revolution
meant that in 1937 nothing remained of that upsurge. Yet Bukharin&#8217;s
lack of dialectics meant that behind the genuflections to the Great
Leader, he could abstract himself from the horrible reality he found
himself in and return to that original source of inspiration
untainted by subsequent events.</p>

<p>To conclude, <strong>Socialism and Its Culture</strong> is worth reading if
you can see beyond the mound of rubbish that first confronts you.
First, as a human document from a key Bolshevik figure it is high
tragedy; second, it gives an insight into the ideological world of
millions of Communists during the central decades of the 20th
century; finally, and most importantly, it provides a fascinating
defence of socialism which even today is fresh and stimulating.</p>
