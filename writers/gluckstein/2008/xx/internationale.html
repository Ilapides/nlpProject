<p class="fst"><em>The Internationale</em> has long been the anthem of the workers&#8217;
movement throughout the world. Its power to move people has survived
the repression of fascism, the cruel parody that was Stalinism and
free market capitalism. Those who sing it need know nothing about it,
and be familiar with only the first verse and the chorus, yet feel a
strong sense of international unity. Why has it proved both so
durable and inspirational?</p>

<p>The verses were written on 30 June 1871 <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>
in the immediate aftermath of the brutal crushing of the Paris
Commune, when the author, Eug&#232;ne Pottier, was hiding in fear of his
life. His lyrics (the music came later) <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>
were intended to impart the historical experience of an important
workers&#8217; struggle to a worldwide audience. At the same time they
inevitably reflect Pottier&#8217;s views. He was a follower of
Proudhonism, an ideology popular in France until it was destroyed
along with the Commune. It is a measure of Pottier&#8217;s achievement,
however, that <em>The Internationale</em> can function simultaneously
as history, political argument and a rallying statement.</p>

<p>Pottier was born in Paris in 1816, a year after Napoleon&#8217;s
defeat at Waterloo and the consequent restoration of the Bourbon
monarchy. The city had been the cradle of the 1789 French Revolution
and of the unprecedented social turbulence that followed. During
Pottier&#8217;s lifetime it was the epicentre of world political life,
the &#8220;capital of the 19th century&#8221;. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a>
Although the bourgeoisie were now in the saddle and the country was
industrialising rapidly, the aspirations for liberty, equality and
fraternity that had been unleashed by the storming of the Bastille
could not be quelled by a foreign-imposed ruler. The genie was out of
the bottle. French capitalists interpreted the motto of 1789 &#8211;
Liberty, equality, fraternity &#8211; as meaning freedom for market
forces to operate, equality as a level playing field for those keen
to exploit the workers and fraternity as all classes uniting behind
the French flag. But for people such as Pottier it meant the promise
of a society in which poor people, like himself, had justice.</p>

<p>Pottier held a number of jobs, none of them well paid. He left
school at the age of 13 to work with his father making packing cases,
later becoming a shop worker, usher and eventually a textile printer.
<a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> But from early on his passion was
poetry and politics. At the age of 14 he witnessed the insurrection
of 1830 that cost the lives of 1,800 revolutionaries. At that time he
wrote his first song &#8211; <em>Vive la libert&#233;!</em> <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a>
In 1848 he was on the barricades once more, participating in the
establishment of the Second Republic. Pottier was outraged when a
relative of Napoleon, Louis Bonaparte, made himself emperor in 1851.
In response he wrote a poem entitled <em>Who Will Revenge This?</em> <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p>The answer came in 1870 when the Parisian masses rose up and
overthrew the emperor, following this with the creation of the
Commune in March 1871. Pottier already had established a reputation
as the workers&#8217; poet. It earned him a seat on the Communal Council
representing the 2nd <em>arrondissement</em>. He came top of the poll
with a 93 percent share of the vote <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a>
and served on the Public Services Commission of the Commune. After 72
days the French government, then based at Versailles, sent in the
army to massacre the communards in what became known as &#8220;Bloody
Week&#8221;. Pottier sought asylum first in Britain and later in the US.
He eventually returned to Paris and died there in 1887. Even in his
coffin Pottier remained controversial. Ten thousand people, including
many leading former communards, turned up at his funeral, but the
cortege was attacked by police who attempted to seize the red flag
carried by mourners. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p>The power of Pottier&#8217;s <em>Internationale</em> lies in the fact
that he was able to encapsulate his personal experience of a specific
event and yet express it in universal terms. This can be seen from
the first lines:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">Arise ye starvelings from your slumbers<br/>
Arise ye criminals of want.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">Under capitalism the working class everywhere suffers poverty
while those who protest are often criminalised. In Paris this
phenomenon took the sharpest of forms &#8211; mass hunger and civil war.
In 1870 Louis Bonaparte launched an attack on Prussia which failed
disastrously. The emperor himself was captured and food supplies to
the capital city, containing the second largest concentration of
people in the world, were cut off for months. While the few wealthy
citizens who had not fled continued to live in luxury the rest were
reduced to eating cats, dogs and rats to survive. Yet far from hunger
cowing working class Parisians it radicalised them. They still
rejected the humiliating peace treaty the reactionary new government
signed. For this snub they would indeed be treated as criminals. When
the Commune was finally defeated many thousands were massacred, but
even more, some 50,000, were put on trial. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a>
Pottier himself was condemned to death in his absence.</p>
<p>The first verse continues:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">For reason in revolt now slumbers<br/>
And at last ends the age of cant.<br/>
So away with all your superstitions<br/>
Servile masses arise, arise,<br/>
We&#8217;ll change forthwith the old conditions<br/>
And spurn the dust to win the prize.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">These references to &#8220;reason&#8221; and &#8220;supersitition&#8221; arose
from the role played by the Catholic church which had always
supported reaction and authority in France. Ever since the
Enlightenment in the 18th century battle had been joined between the
church, which insisted that the existing order had been divinely
ordained and could not be changed by human beings, and those who said
that all institutions could and should be judged by reason and
abolished if found wanting.</p>

<p>Adolphe Thiers, who as head of the French government was the
architect of Bloody Week, insisted that religion was necessary
because it could:</p>

<p class="quoteb">propagate that good philosophy which teaches that man is
here to suffer, and not that philosophy which says the contrary &#8211;
be happy ... If you think that here below you are entitled to a
little bit of happiness, and if you do not find it in your actual
situation, you will strike at rich people fearlessly for having kept
you away from your happiness. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">After 1871, in revenge for the perceived humiliation of the church
at the hands of the Commune, the enormous basilica of the Sacr&#233;-Coeur
was built on the hill of Montmartre. Visible from every corner of the
city it was Paris&#8217;s most striking landmark until the construction
of the Eiffel Tower.</p>

<p>Pottier&#8217;s call to reason therefore reflected the motivation
behind many of the Commune&#8217;s policies. Education was taken out of
the hands of priests and nuns. Marriage became a civil affair with
divorce easier to obtain. While daytime religious ceremonies
continued in Parisian churches, in the evenings they became great
meeting halls where the mass of the population could debate and
democratically control power.</p>

<p>The second verse reads as follows:</p>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">No more divided by reaction<br/>
On tyrants only we will make war<br/>
The soldiers too will take strike action<br/>
They will break ranks and fight no more<br/>
And if those cannibals keep trying<br/>
To sacrifice us to their greed<br/>
They soon shall hear the bullets flying<br/>
We will shoot the generals on our own side.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">This is an exact description of the outbreak of the Commune
itself. On 18 March 1871, shortly after the end of the
Franco-Prussian War, the French government sent its army to seize the
cannons of the Parisian citizen militia. However, confronted by
masses of women protesters the soldiers decided to mutiny rather than
follow orders. When General Lecomte insisted that his troops fire on
the people he was seized and executed by his own men. Verses three
and four show the influence of Proudhonism on Pottier:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">No saviour from on high delivers<br/>
No faith have we in prince or peer<br/>
Our own right hand the chains must sever<br/>
Chains of hatred, greed or fear.<br/>
E&#8217;er the chiefs will out with their booty<br/>
And give all a happier lot<br/>
Each at the forge must do their duty<br/>
And we will strike while the iron is hot.<br/>
<br/>
Laws cheat and the state oppresses<br/>
Their taxes drain the people more<br/>
The rich themselves escape such stresses<br/>
So now what rights have the poor?<br/>
We&#8217;ve enough of languishing in misery<br/>
Equality&#8217;s why we fight<br/>
No more rights without any duties<br/>
And no duties without our rights</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">Here Proudhonist thinking on power and the state is laid out.
While various rival political currents were present in Paris, the
Proudhonists dominated the organised workers&#8217; movement and
controlled the French section of the International Workingmen&#8217;s
Association (IWMA, or First International). In the March 1871
Communal Council elections they captured one third of the seats.
Their version of anarchism owed much of its attraction to the fact
that under the <em>Ancien R&#233;gime</em> and the Napoleonic Empires the
French state had been a model of centralised bureaucracy and physical
repression in the service of the ruling elite. Proudhon (1809&#8211;1865)
concluded that freedom was impossible while a state structure
existed. He therefore called on workers to ignore politics and the
state, and focus their efforts on grassroots self-activity.</p>
<p>When, in 1864, the IWMA was founded and Marx was tasked with
formulating its platform he acknowledged the positive part of the
Proudhonist argument. The <em>General Rules</em> begin with these
words: &#8220;That the emancipation of the working classes must be
conquered by the working classes themselves.&#8221; <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a>
Pottier&#8217;s rejection of any &#8220;saviour from on high&#8221; expresses
this sentiment perfectly.</p>

<p>However, Proudhonism had serious weaknesses. Whether or not
workers choose to ignore it the capitalist state plays an active role
in maintaining the system. Furthermore, the theory took no note of
the unevenness in consciousness that exists in the working class. As
a result Proudhonists did not recognise the need for the more
advanced and conscious sections of the working class to provide
leadership in the struggle against capitalism and its state. Marx
disagreed with the anarchist attitude to politics and therefore
supplemented his initial statement on workers&#8217; self-emancipation
with the following: &#8220;To conquer political power has, therefore,
become the great duty of the working classes.&#8221; <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p>In the Commune arguments about the state and issue of leadership
culminated in bitter disputes. Opponents of Proudhonism warned that
it was not enough to establish a model of democracy and liberation
for others to emulate. The French state was, after all, preparing to
attack Paris and drown the Commune in blood. They proposed
countermeasures, which involved forming a Committee of Public Safety
armed with extensive powers, to take a leadership role in combatting
the government forces massing at Versailles. Pottier showed that the
experience of struggle had taken him beyond the strictures of
Proudhonism and he voted for the new body, though with misgivings:
&#8220;The situation demands energy and unity of action. So despite its
title, I vote for &#8216;the Committee&#8217;.&#8221; <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">Those mining bosses and the rail kings<br/>
It&#8217;s they, the real monsters<br/>
Throughout their lives they do just nothing<br/>
But rob the poor workers<br/>
Whilst in their bank vaults they hoard<br/>
All our labour does create<br/>
By demanding that it is restored<br/>
We now ask for a just fate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">Here Pottier reflected the current state of French
industrialisation which was built on railway expansion generally and
mining in the north east, the most economically developed area of
France. The reference to banking is pure Proudhon, however. His
approach to economics was summed up in the famous aphorism, &#8220;Property
is theft.&#8221; Where Marx located the exploitation of workers at the
core of the capitalist production process, for Proudhon poverty and
riches were explained by the taking of bank interest, dividends and
&#8220;unearned increments&#8221;.</p>

<p>If workers could obtain interest free loans they could organise
cooperative industrial production which would link together in local
communes. Proudhon believed this could successfully compete against
the capitalists, whereupon the current economic system would collapse
and a new society would emerge. He himself made several abortive
attempts to set up a People&#8217;s Bank and get the process started.
There is no space here to discuss the flaws in this vision, only to
note its presence in <em>The International</em>.</p>
<p>Women played an enormous role within the Commune, both in defence
of the cannons on 18 March and during its short life. Examples
include the actions of people such as Louise Michel, the Women&#8217;s
Union, the mass assemblies and the fighting of Bloody Week. Although
line two of the last verse only hints at this, in the context of
prevailing nineteenth century attitudes any reference to women being
part of the struggle, rather than bystanders, was noteworthy:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">We peasants, artisans and others<br/>
Enrolled as daughters, sons of toil<br/>
Let&#8217;s claim the earth for workers<br/>
Drive the indolent from the soil</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">Pottier&#8217;s verses end by affirming that despite the terrible
suffering inflicted by the Versailles army the struggle would revive:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">On our flesh long has fed the raven<br/>
We&#8217;re too long vultures&#8217; prey<br/>
But now farewell the spirit craven<br/>
The dawn brings a brighter day.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">The dawn that Pottier foresaw would not appear for many years,
because repression of the communards was so savage and thorough. But
his hope for a brighter future was not misplaced. Paris itself
experienced an insurrectionary situation in 1944, and the biggest
general strike in history during May 1968. To defiantly predict such
possibilities from the depths of the abyss into which the communards
were thrown required deep commitment and courage.</p>
<p>We now turn to the chorus:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">So comrades come rally<br/>
And the last fight let us face</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">This first section is straightforward. The battles of 1871 had
indeed been the &#8220;last fight&#8221; for many tens of thousands of
communards. In Bloody Week some 30,000 working class women and men
were slaughtered in cold blood. Furthermore, it is the notion of a
final all-out struggle with capitalism that marks out <em>The
Internationale</em> as a revolutionary song. In taking this stance
Pottier again showed that the experience of the Commune had carried
him beyond Proudhon&#8217;s gradualism and disregard for the question of
the state.</p>

<p>It is worthwhile comparing his words to the British Labour Party&#8217;s
(now defunct) anthem, <em>The Red Flag</em>. Although one would be hard
put to discover any bloodsoaked banners in the history of the Labour
Party, that song has suitably dramatic references:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">The people&#8217;s flag is deepest red,<br/>
It shrouded oft our martyrs dead</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p class="fst">The position of the apostrophe in &#8220;people&#8217;s&#8221; is interesting.
Had it been placed after the &#8220;s&#8221; it would have implied solidarity
across borders. In fact the song was written by an Irishman in 1889,
no doubt reflecting his people&#8217;s long national struggle against
British imperialism. They had had many martyrs, but <strong>The Red Flag</strong>&#8217;s
historical provenance means it lacks the internationalism or
proletarian roots of the communard&#8217;s work. And despite the emotive
language <strong>The Red Flag</strong>&#8217;s lyrics are non-committal as regards
the question of reform or revolution, whereas Pottier&#8217;s call to
final struggle is unequivocal.</p>

<p>The concluding part of <em>The Internationale</em>&#8217;s chorus is the
most enigmatic section of all. What do the words &#8220;The
Internationale unites the human race&#8221; actually mean? Things become
even more mysterious if an exact rendering of the original French
words is considered: &#8220;<em>Groupons nous, et demain; l&#8217;Internationale
sera le genre humain</em>&#8221;; literally &#8220;Let us group together, and
tomorrow the International will be the human race&#8221;.</p>

<p>The International referred to here is clearly the IWMA, and it is
this body&#8217;s composition and character that holds the clue to the
meaning of the lines. Although the First International had adherents
from many lands its core was provided by four countries &#8211; Germany,
Italy, Britain and France &#8211; with radically different movements.</p>

<p>In Germany support came from socialist organisations which would
merge to form the Social Democratic Party (SPD). In Italy the
followers of Mazzini formed the IWMA. Organised in small
conspiratorial groupings they were dedicated to stoking up popular
revolts. Britain&#8217;s contingent was composed of trade union
affiliates whose officials mostly gave political allegiance to the
Liberal Party. Their motivation in linking up with the International
was economic rather than political: the IWMA could provide solidarity
to workers on strike and, in particular, prevent the shipping in of
foreign scab labour.</p>

<p>Unlike the Germans, the French section of the IWMA rejected the
idea that its local branches constituted the base of a socialist
party (since it eschewed political leadership). It dismissed Mazzini
who was not only &#8220;an opponent of socialism&#8221;, but whose &#8220;sole
aim ... was to secure a united bourgeois republic&#8221;. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a>
As we have seen, Proudhonists ignored state issues. Equally, British
trade unionism was not seen as a model to follow because the French
aim was far more ambitious than limited reforms or improvements in
pay and conditions. For Pottier and his comrades the First
International was already the germ of a new society based on comradeship.</p>

<p>These differences conditioned what it meant to be a member of the
IWMA. In Britain and Germany the masses of working class people
became part of the organisation through their leading institutional
organ (party committees or union executives). In Italy only a tiny
dedicated minority was involved. In France members did not join a
party or a union; they joined the IWMA directly and in so doing
believed they were engaging in self-emancipation and self-activity
from below. In their terms they had begun the process of superseding
capitalism.</p>

<p>It is interesting, therefore, that the immediacy of the
relationship between the IWMA and its members posited in Pottier&#8217;s
chorus was altered in translation. Eleanor Marx, who first put
Pottier&#8217;s lyrics into English, changed his phrase &#8220;The
Internationale ... <em>will be</em> the human race&#8221; to &#8220;The
Internationale ... <em>unites</em> the human race&#8221;. This latter
form was more suitable for British supporters of the IWMA. Franz
Mehring&#8217;s German version departed even further from the original:
&#8220;<em>Die Internationale erk&#228;mpft das Menschenrecht</em>&#8221; &#8211; &#8221;The International fights for human rights&#8221;.</p>

<p>Pottier&#8217;s words also show the exceptional emphasis the French
section placed on internationalism. For Germany and Italy the decade
up to 1871 was one of unification out of disparate small states.
Mehring explains that in both countries &#8220;the national struggles
naturally forced the idea of internationalism into the background&#8221;.
<a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a> British trade unions were, as
their name implied, organised into separate bodies along craft lines
and their main emphasis was on the benefits of solidarity across
borders rather than abolishing borders themselves.</p>

<p>Pottier and his comrades hoped <em>every</em> worker in <em>every</em>
country would become part of the First International. They believed
that through this self-governing communes would develop and the state
would disappear along with the divisions caused by the existence of
different governments. So the meaning of the chorus is literal. If
the masses grouped together in the International this organisation
would come to embody the human race.</p>

<p>The Paris Commune did indeed display remarkable internationalism.
Many of the key figures in the Commune had originated abroad.
Alongside Louise Michel and Jean Varlin stood people like Leo Frankl,
a Hungarian Jew who headed the important Labour Commission charged
with advancing workers&#8217; economic rights. Elizabeth Dmitriova, a
Russian, led the Women&#8217;s Union. The most prominent generals leading
the Parisian workers&#8217; militia &#8211; the National Guard &#8211; included
Cluseret (an American citizen), Dombrowski and Wroblewski (Poles).
Before 1871 French workers had seen the national anthem, the
<em>Marseillaise</em>, as their hymn. Afterwards it would be <em>The
Internationale</em>. The experience of struggle and of the Commune had
changed mass consciousness.</p>

<p>Understanding Proudhonism or the Commune helps to decode Pottier&#8217;s
<em>Internationale</em>, but this does not convey its full meaning. If
this song had been merely a Proudhonist tract it would suffered the
fate of Proudhonism itself. That ideology along with the Commune&#8217;s
other currents &#8211; Blanquism and neo-Jacobinism &#8211; reflected an
early stage of development. None provided the answers needed by the
workers of Paris in their confrontation with the French ruling class,
its state and army. Consequently these movements faded away after
1871, curiosities relegated to the museum of ideology. Equally,
though a history of 1871 in verse might be interesting it would not
have an enduring impact.</p>

<p>The secret of the poem is that Pottier was able to use his
immediate experience and ideological framework and yet transcend them
to weave a universal message in which the internationalist heart and
soul of the Parisian workers in their titanic fight comes through. No
knowledge of the Commune&#8217;s exciting new vision of women&#8217;s
liberation, education, art, justice and workers&#8217; control is needed
to sense what the struggle for socialism can mean, or that workers
share a common interest the world over.</p>

<p>As a result of this masterful act of creation Pottier&#8217;s verse
has sustained a life of its own long after his death. Its substance
has been added to by the people who have sung it and the struggles
they engaged in. It was sung by mutinous sailors on the Battleship
Potemkin during Russia&#8217;s 1905 revolution; by workers in Madrid
during 1936 who vowed <em>&#161;No pasarán!</em> &#8211; Franco&#8217;s fascists
would not pass; and by the protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most poignant rendering was on May Day 1943 during the
Warsaw Ghetto uprising when the Nazis were about to liquidate the
last remnants of resistance. One of the few survivors wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>The Internationale</em> was sung. The entire world, we
knew, was celebrating May Day on that day and everywhere forceful,
meaningful words were being spoken. But never yet had <em>The
Internationale</em> been sung in conditions so different, so tragic,
in a place where an entire nation had been and was still perishing.
The words and the song echoed from the charred ruins and were, at
that particular time, an indication that Socialist youth was still
fighting in the Ghetto, and that even in the face of death they were
not abandoning their ideals. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Reciting Pottier&#8217;s verse today therefore links us to a long and
proud tradition. Now, at a time of imperialist wars abroad, the
stoking up of racism on the domestic front and a global crisis of
capitalism <em>The Internationale</em> continues to play a role in
inspiring an alternative vision.</p>
