<h1>Forum on Palestine Opens Sessions<br />
of NY <em>Labor Action</em> School</h1>

<h3>(25 November 1946)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Labor Action</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/laboraction-ny/1946/index.htm#la10_47" target="new">Vol. 10 No. 47</a>, 25 November 1946, p.&nbsp;8.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<br />
<p class="fst">The vital interest in the question of Palestine shown by eighty-five members and friends of the Workers Party made for an enthusiastic and successful opening of the Labor Action School&rsquo;s Sunday Evening Forum on November 17. The opening featured a symposium in which Albert Gates, an editor of <strong>Labor Action</strong>, and Ed Findley reported on their views.</p>

<p>Albert Gates, speaking on behalf of the resolution of the National Committee of the Workers Party, and Findley for his counter-resolution, made opening statements that gave rise to many questions bearing on problems of assimilation, immigration, partition, self-determination, the role of Zionism, and many other problems involved in the intricate question before the audience.</p>

<p><em>The discussion from the floor reflected a lively probing of the introductory remarks made by the speakers, and was immediately resumed after the summaries had been made and the meeting officially adjourned. Much interest was shown in the current issue of the <strong>New International</strong> which features material on the question discussed.</em></p>

<p>If this opening of the forum series is any indication of what may be expected from the other forums devoted to very pertinent questions on the schedule, we may be assured of having established a series destined to become a necessary part of the life of our friends and sympathizers.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Reimann Lecture Next</h4>

<p class="fst">The inability of the Big Three to come to grips with the problem of what is to happen to Germany should in itself point to the enormity of the problem which Gunther Reimann, author of <strong>The Vampire Economy</strong> and other works on Germany, will discuss in his lecture on <em>The Fate of Germany</em>. It involves the possibility of grappling with an economic and political question that may spell chaos or survival for European affairs,</p>

<p>The exchange between I.L. Leder and Henry Judd in the current issue of the <strong>New International</strong> on <em>Why the Germans Failed to Revolt</em>, should furnish an introduction to the lecture.</p>

<p>The next forum meets on Sunday evening, November 24, at 8 o&rsquo;clock, at 114, West 14th Street. A complete listing of all the forums scheduled for this semester of the Labor Action School may be obtained by writing to the above address.</p>
