<p class="fst">To the Editors:</p>
<p class="fst">In the editorial notes to Rosa Luxemburg&#8217;s <em>Socialist
Crisis in France</em> your commentator takes issue with the pre-war
social-democratic demand for a people&#8217;s militia. In the July <strong>New
International</strong> he writes that it should be remembered that
Luxemburg&#8217;s defense of this demand was written forty years ago.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It has long been clear &#8211; and, no doubt, became clear
enough to Luxemburg herself during the war &#8211; that &#8216;democratization&#8217; of
the army means little so long as it is used to defend the bourgeois
state, and that the content of &#8216;national defense&#8217; has evaporated in the
period of imperialism.&#8221; (p.202.)</p>

<p class="fst">A note in the October issue adds:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The militia system, or the &#8216;people in arms&#8217;, as the
social-democrats often phrased it, was regarded by the pre-war
socialist movement as the solution of the problem of militarism. Lenin,
writing during the World War, exposed the fallacy of this demand.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Limitations of space do not permit extensive comment on
the problem at this time. For the present the following will suffice:</p>
<p class="fst">1. The demand for a people&#8217;s militia as against the
standing army was part of the general minimum democratic program of
pre-war social-democracy. It was directed against the semi-feudal and
capitalist armies (and militarism) which were independent of the
respective national parliamentary bodies and formed the political
centers of internal and external reaction, Like every democratic demand
advocated by revolutionary socialists the slogan for a people&#8217;s militia
had reformist, social-patriotic as well as revolutionary implications.
That is why Marxists constantly reiterate the limited nature of any
democratic demand and emphasise the indispensability of independent
working class action for its achievement.</p>
<p>To cite a pertinent example: During the World War the Russian
Mensheviks and Bolsheviks both called for the overthrow of the Czarist
monarchy and for a democratic republic. Did that mean that Lenin
expected to be a defensist when the democratic republic was
established? On the contrary, he wrote even before the democratic
revolution of February that in such an eventuality he would continue
his opposition to the Russian government &#8211; though democratic &#8211; in the
imperialist war &#8211; as he later did. The majority of the Mensheviks held
the contrary view, and became defensists under Kerensky.</p>

<p class="fst">2. I don&#8217;t know of any writing of Lenin during the World
War &#8211; or at any other time &#8211; wherein he "exposed the
fallacy of this demand.&#8221; On the contrary, to mention only one example,
Lenin raised this slogan with great force and detail under the Kerensky
regime.</p>
<p class="fst">3. The Fourth International is for the demand of a
people&#8217;s militia today. The program of transition demands adopted at
the founding conference states:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Substitution for the standing army of a <em>peoples
militia</em>, indissolubly linked up with factories, mines, farms, <em>etc.</em>&#8221;

(p.34. Emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="fst">4. Does
this mean that the Fourth International is for &#8220;national
defense&#8221;? The same document gives the reply:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;<em>&#8216;Defense of the Fatherland?&#8217;</em> &#8211; but by this
abstraction, the bourgeoisie understands the defense of its profits and
plunder. We stand ready to defend the fatherland from foreign
capitalists, if we first bind our own capitalists; hand
and foot and hinder them from attacking foreign fatherlands; if the
workers and the farmers of our country become its real masters; if the
wealth of the
country be transferred from the hands of a tiny minority to the hands
of the people; if the army becomes a weapon of the exploited instead of
the exploiters.&#8221; (p.32)</p>

<p class="fst">This is the concrete way in which we raise the demand of
a people&#8217;s militia at the present time.</p>
