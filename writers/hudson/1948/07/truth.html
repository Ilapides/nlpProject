<p class="fst">The Republican Congress calls Truman &ldquo;the poorest president
 since George Washington.&rdquo; The President calls the 80th
 Congress, just ended, &ldquo;the worst in history.&rdquo; There is an
 awful lot of truth in both charges, and it is high time the trade
 union movement acted to defend the American people from the old
 capitalist parties.</P>
<P>From the viewpoint of labor&rsquo;s rights, housing, prices, civil
 liberties, freedom from militarism, and aid to the world&rsquo;s
 oppressed, the working class majority in the United States has been
 hit hard in the past year and one-half.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>What Congress Did</H4>
<p class="fst">First, let&rsquo;s look at what Congress did:</P>
<OL>
<li>It passed the Taft-Hartley bill, thereby placing formidable
	obstacles, in the path of the unions, and making it many times more
	difficult for unions to function in the interests of their members.
	The federal Anti-Labor Law has revived the use of the injunction,
	has subjected unions and union members and leaders to huge fines,
	has permitted government snoopers to stick their long noses into
	union affairs, and has made it much more difficult for workers to
	choose their own union and their own leadership. The boss parties
	are already agitating for an amendment to the Taft-Hartley law which
	would outlaw industry-wide bargaining, thus whittling down the
	unions to a size where they would be all but helpless to defend
	workers&rsquo; interests.<BR>&nbsp;
	<li>On housing, Congress upped rent 15 per cent, and left large
	loopholes for greedy landlords to drive for still higher rent
	boosts.<BR>&nbsp;
	<li>It turned over $13,000,000,000 to the armed services &ndash;
	a larger amount than the whole average pre-war annual budget.<BR>&nbsp;
	<li><em>So for as foreign policy is concerned, Congress and the
	White House teamed up to support reaction everywhere in the world,
	aside from that peculiar form of reaction represented by the Russian
	government and its subject peoples. Washington is supporting
	monarchical reaction in Greece, fascism in Spain, imperialism in the
	Far East, militarism in China, despotism in Korea &ndash; and
	everywhere in the world, Washington is defending the interests of
	Standard Oil and the other large corporations with extensive
	interests abroad.</em><BR>&nbsp;
	<li>Congress pushed through a peacetime draft bill to subject the
	youth of the nation to enforced service in the armed forces.<BR>&nbsp;
	<li>It passed a tax bill which saved pennies for the poor and
	literally billions of dollars for the rich.<BR>&nbsp;
	<li>It passed a bill outlawing portal-to-portal wage suits, thus
	depriving workers of billions of dollars.<BR>&nbsp;
	<li>It waved the Mundt-Nixon &ldquo;anti-Communist&rdquo; bill
	over the country for weeks, as a means of terrorizing political
	minorities.<BR>&nbsp;
</OL>
<H4>What Congress Didn&rsquo;t Do</H4>
<p class="fst">What Congress didn&rsquo;t do is as important as what it did do.</P>
<OL>
	<li>Congress didn&rsquo;t lift a finger to control prices, at a
	period when most economists warn we are in for a session of
	&ldquo;hyper-inflation,&rdquo; and at a time when the cost of living
	is again reaching new all-time peaks.<BR>&nbsp;
	<li>Congress didn&rsquo;t lift a finger to defend civil
	liberties, to outlaw poll taxes, to make lynching a federal offense,
	to require employers to hire without discrimination, or to end Jim
	Crow in the armed forces.<BR>&nbsp;
	<li>Congress didn&rsquo;t lift a finger to put a roof over a
	single American family.<BR>&nbsp;
	<li><em>Congress shrugged its shoulders as the big monopolies
	continued to pick the pockets of the people. Just to demonstrate
	sharply Its reliable service to monopoly, in the closing days
	Congress shoved through the Bulwinkle bill exempting the nation&rsquo;s
	railroads from the anti-trust laws.</em><BR>&nbsp;
	<li>Congress refused to increase the legal minimum wage, at a
	time when a fourth of the American people are going more deeply into
	debt each month.<BR>&nbsp;
	<li>Congress refused to enact a government health insurance
	program.<BR>&nbsp;
	<li>Congress refused federal aid for education, at a time when
	the nation&rsquo;s educational system is grossly inadequate for the
	needs of the people.
</OL>
<p class="fst">Even in the little things, Congress catered to selfish interests.
 After making handsome gestures, it left the silly and unfair taxes on
 oleo; jammed through high tariffs on wool and other commodities;
 continued farm legislation in the interests of the big farmers.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Truman&rsquo;s Record</H4>
<p class="fst">Truman was not a shade better than Congress. The Democrat in the
 White House exercized equal energy in kicking labor in the face.</P>
<P>Truman&rsquo;s criticism of the Republican Congress is as phony as
 the counterfeit $10 bills which have recently been flooding Chicago.</P>
<P>The <B>Wall Street Journal</strong> in its June 22 editorial took care
 of Truman on this point. After listing some of Truman&rsquo;s &ldquo;must&rdquo;
 legislation which Congress dumped, that paper stated:</P>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Now each of these passed-over measures was first
 suggested by the late President Roosevelt at a time when he had as
 complete control over Congress as any President has ever had. Mr.
 Roosevelt had a Democratic Congress and the bills weren&rsquo;t
 passed then.</p>
<p class="quote"><em>&ldquo;President Truman took over the Roosevelt
 program and proposed all these same things to Congress while he, too,
 had a Democratic majority in both Houses. Again the Congress rejected
 the administration&rsquo;s plan! Curiously, although both Presidents
 Roosevelt and Truman included these matters in their messages to the
 Democratic Congresses, THERE WAS NEVER MUCH PRESSURE FROM THE WHITE
 HOUSE FOR ENACTMENT UNTIL A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS CAME ALONG. </em>(my
 emphasis &ndash; <em>J.R.</em>).</p>
<p class="quote">&ldquo;It strikes us that if two Democratic Congresses
 were dubious of the wisdom of the social legislation offered by a
 Democratic President it is hardly justifiable suddenly to berate a
 Republican Congress for showing the same cautions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="fst">Neither the Democratic nor Republican wings of the boss political
 monopoly can criticize each other with either justice or grace. But
 the workers who are fleeced by the capitalist political machines can
 certainly do so.</P>
<P>That&rsquo;s the record of the President and the legislators who
 were elected to office, most of them with the support of the
 conservative trade union leadership.</P>
<P>That record provides new proof that what labor needs is not a new
 deal, but a new party &ndash; a national labor party &ndash; to take
 over Washington and form a labor government. We&rsquo;ll never get
 justice from the Wall Street-dominated old parties.</P>
