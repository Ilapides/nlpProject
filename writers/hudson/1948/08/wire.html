<br />
<p class="fst">A few weeks ago in Chicago the armed forces&rsquo; Industrial
 College held a special, semi-secret two-week industrial and economic
 mobilization course for big businessmen.</P>
<P>Only one newspaper, the <strong>Chicago Journal of Commerce</strong>,
 covered the event, and that paper was permitted to discuss only
 certain portions of the information divulged. Interesting facts about
 the plans of industrial and military men for the coming war were
 divulged in the <strong>Journal</strong>&rsquo;s series.</P>
<P><em>The student body consisted of 140 &ldquo;civilian conferees&rdquo;
 &ndash; executives from seven banks, two large merchandising firms,
 four utilities, five railroads and 80 manufacturing and other
 companies, together with seven universities. About 140 high-ranking
 reserve officers also attended.</em></P>
<P>Competition among industrialists to attend was reported &ldquo;very
 keen,&rdquo; the reason no doubt being that attendance would place a
 halo of &ldquo;know how&rdquo; around the persons and companies
 represented, and would also give them &ldquo;connections&rdquo; with
 the nation&rsquo;s military leaders in charge of placing war orders.</P>
<P>It is significant that the favored companies were instructed to
 send not their chiefs but the &ldquo;heirs apparent&rdquo; in the
 next decade. This might indicate that the U.S. political and military
 leaders do not contemplate any immediate armed conflict with Stalin&rsquo;s
 government.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Tooling Up for War</H4>
<p class="fst">Army lecturers revealed that the productive capacity of 7,780
 American manufacturing plants had already been tentatively allocated
 to one or more of the three military services in the program of
 economic mobilization which began last winter. Allocation of the
 principal production facilities of some 11,000 additional factories
 is in process, with the overall goal embracing 22,000 establishments.</P>
<P>The allocation process includes a concrete agreement providing for
 the major part of a plant&rsquo;s industrial capacity to produce a
 specific item of munitions at a specific rate of output, according to
 the <strong>Journal</strong>. The corps of engineers is planning requirements
 for a period described as M-Day plus two years, and is vigorously
 pushing the allocation program through six area procurement offices.</P>
<P><em>In preparation for the coming war, the Army-Navy Machine Total
 Committee has set itself the objective of stockpiling 182,000 tools
 as a national reserve. In addition to the equipment already acquired,
 the military has impounded in cosmoline the war production machine
 tools of 161 large plants.</em></P>
<P>(Naturally these war preparations do not bring sobs from the
 machine-tool builders. The last war saved their financial necks. In
 the depression years their annual sales went down to only
 $22,000,000. By 1942 sales had increased 65-fold, to $1,320,000,000,
 and in 1947 were at a level above $300,000,000.)</P>
<P>One of the most interesting talks must have been that made by
 Lt.-Col. James Massey, He warned his audience that if the armed
 forces and industry consumed as much of the nation&rsquo;s natural
 resources in another war as they did in the Second World War, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
 be bankrupt. We wasted as much as we used.&rdquo;<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Bedrock Economy</H4>
<p class="fst">If and when the United States is called upon to fight another
 major war, the American standard of living will be cut to bedrock, he
 said. Massey and other brass made it clear that the civilian economy
 would take second place in the war. Commander W.T. Greenhalgh said
 that the conversion to &ldquo;bedrock economy&rdquo; would be &ldquo;quick,
 brutal and absolute.&rdquo;</P>
<P>The lectures on manpower were not reported, but they must have
 hinted at plans ominous for the future of the labor movement and of
 civil liberties.</P>
<P><em>Apparently, the bankers, industrialists, politicos and military
 men are seriously concerned about the possibility of a &ldquo;collapse
 of the home front&rdquo; in the event the nation suffers the rigors
 of atomic war. Commander Gold said that present planning was directed
 solely toward victory, &ldquo;with the single reservation that the
 home front must be guarded against collapse, as the civilian economy
 of Germany collapsed in earlier wars.&rdquo;</em></P>
<P>That is the classic position of the capitalist class in wartime:
 Victory if possible, but by all means hold the lid down at home.</P>
<P>As in the last war, it is probable that the political leaders of
 the nation will not be able to apply a rigid, preconceived plan
 designed to strap the people into the strait-jacket of war. Rather it
 will be an inch-by-inch affair, with democratic rights and civil
 liberties being progressively withdrawn. At the rate events are
 moving &ndash; Taft-Hartleyism, Goldsborough injunctions,
 red-baiting, the draft, both parties committed to universal military
 training &ndash; the process has already been set in motion. If the
 course of affairs is not challenged sharply in the near future by the
 creation of a national labor party, the worst of the new plans will
 be able to be pushed through.</P>
