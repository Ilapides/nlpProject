<h1>The Best the System Can Offer</h1>

<p class="info">From <strong>Labor Action</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/laboraction-ny/1948/index.htm#la12_21" target="new">Vol. 12 No. 21</a>, 24 May 1948, p.&#160;3.<br />

<p class="fst">The workers in the United States have, in the period from 1941 to the present, enjoyed the best that the capitalist system has ever given them or is ever likely to give them. There have been more jobs available than ever before. Money wages have been higher than ever before. More goods have been turned out than ever before.</p>

<p>Yet, just how much better off are we today than we were in 1939?</p>

<p>Let us sit as a jury-and-judge and pass our judgment on what capitalism has to offer us &#8211; not in its worst days, not from 1929 to 1939, but in its palmiest days, flushed with war and postwar prosperity.</p>

<p>Today let us receive evidence from one of the journalistic bulwarks of capitalism. Not from the CIO research department, not from socialist archives, but; from the <strong>U.S. News and World Report</strong>, issue of May 7, an article entitled: <em>End to Easy Raises in Pay: Workers&#8217; Gains and Losses</em>.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8221;Pay raises are going to come harder from now on,&#8221; the article begins. &#8220;This is to be true of raises in wage rates and in salaries as well.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The remainder of the article is a succinct report of what has happened to various groups of workers since 1939, measured by changes in weekly &#8220;real&#8221; incomes (that is, wages adjusted for cost-of-living increases, after federal taxes).<br />
&#160;</p>

<a id="p1" name="p1"></a>
<h4>What Happened to Wages</h4>

<p class="fst">Here is what the report shows:</p>

<ul>
<li>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORKERS: Earned $36.16 in real wages in 1939; earned $30.35 in real wages in July 1945; earning $30.94 in real wages today.</li>

<li>LIGHT AND POWER WORKERS: In 1939, $34.38; in 1945, $33.82; today, $32.26.</li>

<li>RAILROAD WORKERS: In 1939, $36.17; in 1945, $34.98; today, $36.74.</li>

<li>PRINTING AND PUBLISHING WORKERS: In 1939, $32.42; in 1945, $31.58; today, $33.55.</li>

<li>IRON AND STEEL WORKERS: In 1939, $27.52; in 1945, $33.88; today, $31.20.</li>

<li>SCHOOL TEACHERS: In 1939, $27.64; in 1945, $26.54; today, $26.41.</li>

<li>RETAIL WORKERS: In 1939, $21.17; in 1945, $21.04; today, $21.10.</li>

<li>AUTOMOBILE WORKERS: In 1939, $32.91; in 1945, $35.63; today, $33.33.</li>

<li>CONSTRUCTION WORKERS: In 1939, $30.24; in 1945, $37.00; today, $35.58.</li>

<li>TEXTILE WORKERS: In 1939, $16.84; in 1945, $22.35; today, $24.83.</li>

<li>SOFT-COAL MINERS: In 1939, $23.88; in 1945, $34.07; today, $40.35.</li>

<li>RETIRED FEDERAL WORKERS ON PENSIONS: In 1939, $23.01; today, $16.70.</li>

<li>VETERANS ON COMPENSATION: In 1939, $23.00; today, $18.70.</li>
</ul>

<p class="fst">That ends the simple exhibit.</p>

<p>In the light of this evidence, do you believe: &#8220;the changes in &#8216;real&#8217; take-home pay since the war end have meant only modest gains or actually have brought losses,&#8221; as observed in <strong>U.S. News</strong>. &#8220;All the strikes and turmoil of the last three years led to a general marking up of price tags, both for wages and salaries and for goods. Yet the net addition to living standards, except for a few groups, was not great.&#8221;<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Proves Need of New Weapons</h4>

<p class="fst">In the light of this evidence, do you believe:</p>

<ul>
<li>That the trade union leadership of the United States through its policies has adequately protected the interests of the American working class?<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>That if this is the BEST that capitalism has to offer, the capitalist system is worth defending?<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>That socialism, with its program of collective ownership of the means of production under the democratic control of the workers, and production for use and not for profit, could possibly do worse than capitalism at its best has accomplished?<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>That the workers can afford to continue their struggle for better living conditions without a new weapon, the national labor party?</li>
</ul>
