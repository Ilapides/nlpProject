<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/socialist-appeal-1939/index.htm#sa03_90" target="new">Vol. III No. 90</a>, 24 November 1939, p.&#160;1.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">The second half of the National $10,000 Organization and Press Fund Drive must go over the top on scheduled time. The twice-weekly <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong> is at stake.</p>

<p>Without doubt our Party and its sympathizers are quite capable to insure the maintenance of our most important instrument for spreading the program of the Fourth International and the Socialist Workers Party.</p>

<p>Our semi-weekly paper has been maintained without missing a single issue since our twice-a-week was established. One must not even contemplate a retreat, but, on the contrary, must look forward to increased frequency of the <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>.</p>

<p>The Party branches in the past have responded to the requests for the necessary financial assistance to sustain the <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>. By a similar response in the second half of the campaign there can be no doubt but that our Press can be maintained and established on a sounder footing than ever.</p>

<p>The reports from the Party branches throughout the country indicate their readiness to proceed with full speed to fulfill their quotas. We are confident that all supporters of our revolutionary Press will make every effort to fulfill their quotas for the National Organization and Press Fund Campaign before February 1st.</p>
