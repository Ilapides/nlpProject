<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1933/index.htm#tm33_04" target="new">Vol. VI No. 4</a>, 28 January 1933, p.&#160;1.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">There is every reason to hope that the Weekly <strong>Militant</strong> will continue. Thus far, our paper has depended almost exclusively upon the membership of the Communist League, out of their limited resources, to maintain the leading English expression of Bolshevism. Now, today, our readers and sympathizers must lend a hand to save the Weekly. The demands upon our numerically small membership have been heavy, especially so in this lengthy period of economic crisis.</p>

<p>We have no doubt that our readers will respond to the plain, frank appeal of the Left Opposition to maintain the Weekly <strong>Militant</strong>.</p>

<p>The requirements of the situation demand more and more the participation and direction of the Left Opposition in the daily class struggles. Through the <strong>Militant</strong>, still our best organizer, the ideas and practices of Leninism, of the Left Opposition, are made known to the Communist movement, to the Left Opposition, to the broad masses of workers coming steadily, if yet slowly, toward class consciousness and Communism.</p>

<p>The <strong>Militant</strong> can and must be maintained. Its existence as a Weekly through these scourging years of the economic crisis, have shown clearly the devotion and sacrifice of the supporters of the Left Opposition to their paper. What has been done before, can be done again &#8211; better and even more generously. Sympathizers, readers &#8211; help the <strong>Militant</strong> now! Save our and your Weekly!</p>
