<p class="fst"><strong>CHICAGO</strong> &#8211; Twenty American Legion Posts in Chicago have just formed the Chicago Council of Union Legionaires. These pro-union labor Legionaires, while remaining members of the American Legion, aim to counteract its anti-labor policy and practices. They condemn, the anti-labor fulminations of Roane Waring, national commander of the Legion and corporation boss of the Memphis, Tenn., street railways.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4 class="western">Oppose Legion&#8217;s Anti-Labor Policy</h4>

<p class="fst">The Chicago Council of Union Legionaires has further declared itself in strong opposition to the open shop proposal adopted by the national executive committee at its recent sessions in Indianapolis.</p>

<p><em>The NEC also called for the adoption of the Wassworth-Austin resolution for compulsory military service, now before Congress. Such a law, declared the NEC, &#8220;would settle any crisis [strikes] anywhere,&#8221; since it would prevent any strike &#8220;against the government.&#8221; In avowing again its open shop policy, the Legion declares that no ex-soldier of the present war &#8220;shall be forced to join any trade union ... to gain employment.&#8221; Thus the American Legion consistently maintains its scabbing policy.</em></p>

<p>In fact, for nearly twenty-five years the American Legion, organized and continuously backed ever since by big business, <em>has been the biggest single strike-breaking force in the country</em>. Many worker ex-servicemen, duped into joining this outfit, soon became disgusted with the vicious anti-labor policy of the American Legion leadership and got out of the organization. Those who remained have been more and more aroused at the increasing insolence of the Legion&#8217;s program and leadership. More and more this program and leadership have expressed themselves along fascist lines, American style.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4 class="western">Big Dough Comes from Corporations</h4>

<p class="fst">If anyone in labor&#8217;s ranks still has illusions concerning the American Legion, let it be noted that the National Executive Committee also adopted an &#8220;Americanism Program&#8221;; that is, an anti-labor program.</p>

<p><em>To remove any doubts about this, the NEC voted to accept $20,000,000 from &#8220;business sources,&#8221; that is, from the big corporations of America, in order to finance this &#8220;Americanism program.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Recently, William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, advised working men war veterans to join the American Legion today in order to combat the fascist and anti-labor elements of the Legion. This proposal is at least two decades too late. <em>For today, Green&#8217;s advice is no good. Big business controls the Legion, hook, line and sinker. The ranks have never held office in it.</em><br />
&#160;</p>

<h4 class="western">Labor Must Organize Veterans</h4>

<p class="fst">Here and there, it is true, there have been evidences of resentment and opposition to the American Legion&#8217;s policy; Thus the South Fork, Pa., Post of the Legion sent an apology to John L. Lewis for Waring&#8217;s speeches against the United Mine Workers Union in recent months. The commander of the American Legion Post in Minneapolis, Jack Carrier, sharply attacked Waring, declaring his speeches &#8220;sound like Hitler and Goebbeels.&#8221; <em>He advises Waring to &#8220;take off your Legion cap and put on the uniform of the National Association of Manufacturers.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>The Chicago Council of Union Legionnaires represents the best and most widely organized opposition to the Legion policies and leadership.</p>

<p>The fact that they have organized into a special group to defend labor&#8217;s interests: inside the Legion is to be welcomed heartily. Their action is tantamount to recognition of the Legion&#8217;s anti-labor policy and leadership, and of the need to fight them both in an organised way. But if they think they can convert the hidebound, reaction-ruled and boss-controlled Legion into an aid to labor, they will find themselves sadly mistaken. The bosses have their veterans&#8217; organization. Labor ought to have one of its own.</p>

<p>However, apart from the worker ex-servicemen of World War I, there are already eleven million future veterans of World War II whom the American Legion is now endeavoring to enroll in the Legion.</p>

<p><em>As a first measure, the American labor movement (CIO, AFL, independent unions) must warn all worker-soldiers to steer clear of the American Legion. Moreover, the labor movement must now give serious attention to the integration of the worker ex-servicemen into the labor unions after the war. At the same time, labor must start working on the idea of forming a war veterans&#8217; organization of workingmen.</em></p>
