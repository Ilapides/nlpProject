<p class="fst">The Twice-a-week <strong>APPEAL</strong> will soon be here &#8211; a fact, and not just a hope and ambition. The requirements of the day-make this a certainty. Tremendous events are unrolling before all our eyes. The revolutionary press is essential to reflect these stirring and decisive developments, affecting all lives; but more important, to help to direct them in the interests of the working class and exploited peoples everywhere.</p>

<p>A truism, but fundamental: the revolutionary press is the major educator and organizer of the labor and revolutionary movement. Trade union and political organization of the working masses needs enormously to be speeded up. The revolutionary Party, the Socialist Workers Party, needs to be geared to meet the needs of the hour on the labor and political fronts, in the United States and internationally.</p>

<p>The <strong>APPEAL</strong> is a decisive instrument in this work. The members and sympathizers of the Socialist Workers Party are rallying and will rally still more strongly to our press and Its needs. THE TWICE-A-WEEK <strong>APPEAL</strong> IS NOW A NECESSITY. BECAUSE IT MUST, IT WILL BE! HAIL THE TWICE-A-WEEK <strong>APPEAL</strong>! On the road to a DAILY <strong>APPEAL</strong>!</p>
