<p class="fst"><strong>Fargo, N.D.</strong>, April 7. The 37th, and last city of the tour! It was very gratifying to be able to report to the Fargo workers at last night&#8217;s house meeting that the tour had been eminently successful.</p>

<p>It was also gratifying to learn from them of the progress which has been made in this city, once the center of reaction of the area, since the great strikes of 1934 and 1935.</p>

<p>Most gratifying of all were the plans laid for a public meeting to be held here under the auspices of the Socialist Workers Party within the next few weeks.</p>

<p>The public meeting held at Plentywood, Montana, on April 4, brought out 118 workers and farmers. A vast majority of those present were dispossessed farmers who are now on relief or WPA. It was very easy for them to understand that Wallace&#8217;s AAA and Roosevelt&#8217;s so-called Social Security programs had not ended the system of &#8220;want amidst plenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many of these proletarianized farmers accept the revolutionary program as the only solution to their problems. Some of them have been members of the Communist party in the past, but have broken away or been expelled because of &#8220;deviations from the line.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Trotskyist press has played an important role in all this. A great deal of credit must be given to those Plentywood comrades who have been so loyal and self-sacrificing in spreading the ideas of Trotskyism through the distribution of our press and literature.</p>
