<p class="fst"><strong>San Francisco</strong>, March 29 &#8211; An audience of over 50 seamen, longshoremen, dining car employees, culinary workers, building trades workers and others heard the Trotskyist analysis of <em>The War Today</em> at the open meeting which I addressed in San Francisco last night.</p>

<p>From the interested questions and the substantial collection, one may draw the encouraging conclusion that an increasing number of San Francisco militants are accepting Trotskyism as the, only solution to the problems of the working class.</p>

<p>On Monday night, March 24, I had an opportunity to speak in Oakland at a meeting, sponsored by the Oakland Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Copies of <strong>The Militant</strong> and leaflets announcing the SWP meeting were distributed there after the meeting. Some of the Negro workers who attended last night&#8217;s meeting were undoubtedly attracted there as a result of this distribution.</p>

<p>Good meetings were also held in Los Angeles and San Pedro. The Los Angeles mass meeting, which was held on March 23, attracted over 100 people. Many of these were militants from the aviation industry, who applauded vigorously all of the attacks made upon the red-baiting tactics of Roosevelt, Knudsen, Hillman, Green and the others. One aircraft worker, who announced that he was at his first Trotskyist meeting, took the floor to express his support of our program of an independent working class struggle against fascism.</p>

<p>The audience in San Pedro was made up of seamen, shipyard workers and cannery Workers. Some of these were Mexicans, and they had a genuine appreciation of our analysis of hypocrisy of the Rooseveltian &#8220;good neighbor&#8221; in Mexico and South America.</p>
