<p class="fst">NEW YORK, Jan. 25. &#8211; (Note to Minnesota comrades. It&#8217;s <em>true</em> what they say about New York! The general character and tone of the New York party has changed completely in the past eight months since the departure of the members of the Minority. The comrades here are workers now and their contacts whom they bring to meetings are also workers.</p>

<p>(Remember the indignation of our delegates to the Party convention in New York last April at the outrageous behavior of the undisciplined petty-bourgeois Minority members &#8211; whispering, shuffling around, laughing, etc., etc. Last night&#8217;s mass meeting here was completely different. Everyone sat quietly in his place and listened to the speakers! <em>Revolutionary!</em></p>

<p>(Furthermore, the 250 members and friends in attendance, who came to the meeting despite the heavy snow storm, contributed over $130 in response to Comrade Morrow&#8217;s masterly collection speech.)</p>

<p>My second meeting in Boston held on January 20 in East Boston, was also a very inspiring one. Approximately 150 attended and these were chiefly Italian and Spanish workers. The meeting was held in the hall of an Italian workers&#8217; group, with the cooperation of a number of the youth of this group.</p>

<p>The Boston branch too reflects the great change in the character of the party since the loss of the petty-bourgeois Minority. This <em>loss</em> was our <em>gain</em>.</p>
