<p class="fst">NEW YORK, Feb. 4 &#8211; I am sure that everyone who attended the Banquet given by Local New York on Feb. 1 at Germania Hall agreed that it was a huge success. The hall and the tables were beautifully decorated; a fine crowd of 125 comrades and friends were in attendance; last, but not least, the collection taken up by Comrade W. Warde for refugee aid was over $250.</p>

<p>Felix Morrow acted as toastmaster. Farrell Dobbs, Albert Goldman, Henry Martin, Larry Williams and I were on the speaking program. It was interesting to note that the speeches all dealt with various phases of Party work &#8211; the distribution of the <strong>Militant</strong>, trade union work in New York, recruiting in New York and throughout the country, etc. These practical, down-to-the-earth speeches were listened to by the comrades and friends with the greatest interest. A further indication of the wonderful change in the New York Party.</p>

<p>In my speech at the Banquet, I took occasion to thank the New York comrades in the name of the Minnesota Party, since I understood very well that the Banquet &#8211; formally in my honor &#8211; was intended to honor the Minnesota comrades for the good work done in the election campaign.</p>

<p>As I leave New York, I want to thank all of the New York comrades again for the very pleasant time that I had during my stay in the &#8220;Big City.&#8221;</p>
