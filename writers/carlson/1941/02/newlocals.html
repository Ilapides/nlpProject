<p class="fst">PITTSBURGH &#8211; The most, interesting news of the week on my tour comes from two cities where until the other day our party had nothing &#8211; Pittsburgh and Baltimore.</p>

<p>Today, however, the Socialist Workers Party is definitely on the political map in Pittsburgh. My meeting here was the only public commemoration of the anniversary of Lenin&#8217;s death. Twenty-nine workers attended the open meeting, and indicated by their interested questions and participation in the discussion a real interest in the Trotskyist program. Subscriptions for <strong>The Militant</strong> were obtained and other Trotskyist literature was sold, so we can be confident that these workers intend to study our program. There is real promise of a rapid growth of our party in this great steel center.</p>

<p>Baltimore is another important steel center. It is also becoming a center in the aviation industry. The &#8220;open shop&#8221; tradition of Baltimore is breaking down as the SWOC and the UAW meet with great success in their organizing drives.</p>

<p>The Baltimore branch of the party was organized a short time ago. Its first task, successfully achieved, was to get all of the members into basic industry and the unions of these industries. We may look forward with confidence to other achievements, and soon, by the Baltimore branch.</p>
