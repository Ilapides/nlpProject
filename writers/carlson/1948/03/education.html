<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1948/index.htm#m48_12" target="new">Vol. XII No. 12</a>, 22 March 1948, p.&nbsp;4.<br />

<p class="fst">Readin&rsquo;, &rsquo;Ritin&rsquo; and &rsquo;Rithmetic are the much-talked-about and much-sung-about three R&rsquo;s. To hear American politicians talk &ndash; especially in election years &ndash; one would be led to believe that every American child had an equal opportunity to master not only the three R&rsquo;s but also any other subject in which he was interested. The facts, of course, are quite the opposite.</p>

<p>In their recent study, <strong>Unfinished Business in American Education</strong>, Professors John Norton and Eugene Lawler point out that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Three million adults living in the United States have never attended any kind of school.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Ten million adult Americans have had so little real schooling that they are actually illiterate.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Half of the brightest and most talented youth in the country leave school prematurely &ndash; before they have had the kind and amount of schooling which would train them to make full use of their talents.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Two million children, aged 6 to 15, were not in any kind of school in 1940 and this number was substantially increased during and after the war.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Underpaid, overworked teachers are unable to provide decent schooling to other millions of American children because they are handicapped by inadequate instructional supplies, ancient textbooks and crowded classrooms.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">These tragic conditions exist because the capitalist politicians are not willing to spend enough money for the education of the country&rsquo;s children. Only three billion dollars a year is appropriated by all public agencies &ndash; state, federal and city &ndash; for the operation of the schools in 1948. But 23 billion dollars will be spent for militarism in the United States this year (over 62% of the total budget).</p>

<p>And the proposal is now being made that another 3 to 5 billion be added to the military budget each year in order to finance Universal Military Training! In the January issue of <strong>Economic Outlook</strong>, the CIO Educational Department tells working class parents just what this 3 billion could buy for the school children of the United States. It would be possible to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Construct a 10-room modern school building in <em>every</em> county in the United States <em>each</em> year.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Construct a $50,000 library in <em>every</em> county in the United States <em>each</em> year.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Employ 10 doctors and 10 nurses full-time for schools in <em>each</em> county.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Purchase 10 new school buses in <em>each</em> county in the United States <em>every</em> year.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Erect a $750,000 trade and technical school in <em>each</em> congressional district <em>each</em> year.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Provide free education for the 3 million children now under 18 who are not now attending school.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Bring all schools of the country up to a reasonable standard of efficiency.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">And there would still be millions left over!</p>
