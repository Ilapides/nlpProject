<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1945/index.htm#m45_19" target="new">Vol. IX No. 19</a>, 12 May 1945, p.&nbsp;3.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<br />
<p class="fst"><em>Patch, Save and Wear Out! V-E Day Won&rsquo;t End Shortages</em>. This is the headline of a feature article which appeared in the April 17 <strong>St. Paul Dispatch</strong>. &ldquo;Some of the really troublesome shortages &ndash; the day-to-day needs that worry housewives and cause hours of hunting in the stores &ndash; in shirts, shoes, house dresses, children&rsquo;s overalls and infant&rsquo;s underthings are likely to become worse before they are better, come V-E Day or not,&rdquo; the article goes on to say.</p>

<p>My sister Dorothy sent me this clipping along with an angry three-page letter. Because she is writing about problems which all working-class mothers face these days of wartime shortages, skyrocketing prices and frozen wages, I think that the readers of <strong>The Militant</strong> will find her letter interesting. &ldquo;Ann&rdquo; is her seven-year-old girl; &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; her three-year-old boy &ndash; and, as parents of children of these ages know, they seem to outgrow their clothes overnight!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Try and Get It!</h4>

<p class="fst">Here is her letter.</p>

<p class="quoteb">I happened to run across this item on the financial page and thought there might be something in it you could use. I suppose that&rsquo;s because I myself feel pretty strongly on the question of what happens when I go shopping &ndash; especially for children&rsquo;s things.</p>

<p class="quote"><em>You must have heard me complain that Jim had to wear his last year&rsquo;s shirts, which were two sizes too small for him all winter because I couldn&rsquo;t find any to fit him. When I tried to exchange the red bedroom slippers you bought him for St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day, I discovered that there are no bedroom slippers in larger sizes in the stores. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve been out for months,&rsquo; they inform you.</em></p>

<p class="quote">When I bought shoes for Jim last month (and that makes $24 we&rsquo;ve spent on children&rsquo;s shoes in 7 months) I tried to get rubbers too &ndash; and people just laughed. One store keeper said he could sell me overshoes. He told me that he had been trying to get them all winter and had received a whole &lsquo;basement full&rsquo; just as spring came.</p>

<p class="quote">I&rsquo;m paying 29 cents and 39 cents per pair for socks for them because the cheaper socks always seem to be out while there is always a nice choice of color and size in the more expensive ones.</p>

<p class="quote">Ann is wearing her last year&rsquo;s spring coat which is much too short for her. Of course, I could find plenty of new coats for her at $15 to $20. All the stores are advertising expensive coats and hats and they have stacks and stacks of luxurious handmade silk underwear &ndash; while youngsters can&rsquo;t get shirts!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Shop Around</h4>

<p class="quoteb"><em>I certainly sound like a complaining housewife! I really know that there are burdens under capitalism which are a million times worse, but the hypocrisy of a &lsquo;Patch, Save and Wear Out&rsquo; campaign when most workers&rsquo; belongings are already close to the worn-out stage and at the same time luxury goods fill the stores is pretty annoying.</em></p>

<p class="quote">Ann and Jim have been pestering and pestering so I&rsquo;ll have to break off. Let me add just one rote of further annoyance. After you do go shopping for children&rsquo;s shirts, towel racks for the bathroom, some kind of sauce pans other than the expensive glass ones that the children break &ndash; some salesgirls always says, &lsquo;We did have some in. You&rsquo;ll just have to come in often so you can catch them while they&rsquo;re here.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="quote">For somebody with children who is paying money to a girl to stay with the children &ndash; or like Elaine&rsquo;s sister-in-law has dragged three children across town to leave with her mother &ndash; and is hoping to get a batch of necessary items in the short time available, that is the last straw! Just spend several hours, two or three times a week to shop around stores to see if anything has come in!</p>

<p class="quote">I have to go now to show Jimmy how to make &lsquo;feets&rsquo; on the picture of the little boy he is drawing.</p>

<p class="quoter">As ever, Dorothy<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Super-Profits</h4>

<p class="fst">A fitting climax to this report of the working-class housewife&rsquo;s shopping problems is the recently-issued report of the OPA on department store profits for 1943. In dollar figures, department store profits reached $593,800,000 in 1943 in contrast to average profits from 1936&ndash;39 of $51,800,000. This represents an increase in 1943 profits of 1038 per cent! And preliminary figures on 1944 show that they are doing still better still!</p>

<p><em>But the National Retail Dry-goods Association isn&rsquo;t satisfied yet. They asked the OPA recently to permit them to raise prices still more on the lower-priced articles &ndash; otherwise they will continue to refuse to carry such merchandise!</em></p>

<p>Who still thinks that we should PATCH and SAVE this WORN-OUT CAPITALIST SYSTEM?</p>
