<p class="fst">Headed by the reactionary poll-taxer Representative John Rankin of Mississippi, the House Committee on World War Veterans Legislation is attempting to convert its so-called investigation of conditions in veterans&rsquo; hospitals into a witch-hunt against newspapermen, doctors and veterans who exposed the bad state of affairs in these institutions. The Committee&rsquo;s latest move was the indictment of Albert Deutsch, reporter for <strong>PM</strong> on May 18. Deutsch was cited for &ldquo;contempt of Congress&rdquo; when he refused to reveal the names of doctors who had supplied him with information for a series of articles criticizing the treatment of discharged servicemen in Veterans Administration hospitals.</p>

<p>This whitewash of the Veterans Administration was undertaken by the Rankin-led Committee in order to head off an &ldquo;impartial investigation&rdquo; into complaints of conditions in veterans&rsquo; hospitals proposed late in March by Representative Philbin of Massachusetts. By a parliamentary maneuver Rankin had Philbin&rsquo;s motion killed and then announced that each member of his Committee would visit &ldquo;veterans&rsquo; hospitals during the Easter recess to check up on conditions. At the same time he called Brigadier General Frank Hines, Administrator of Veterans Affairs before a closed session of his Committee and immediately afterward issued a statement complimenting General Hines for the manner in which veterans hospitals are operated.</p>

<p><em>But there was too much heat upon the members of Congress to permit so cynical a whitewash of the Veterans Administration. Too many letters were pouring in from veterans and members of their families complaining about the terrible conditions in the veterans&rsquo; hospitals. Rankin tried to discredit this evidence against the Veteran Administration officials in a speech in the House on May 11, in which he said, &ldquo;Many such letters have been received by Members of Congress from individuals that we checked up and found to be insane.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>But Rankin could not pass off as &ldquo;insane&rdquo; such writers as Deutsch, Leo Egan of the <strong>N.Y. Times</strong>, Thomas Niall of the Associated Press and Victor Maisel of <strong>Cosmopolitan</strong> magazine. Pressure put upon the members of the House Committee by readers of the articles of these informed investigators of conditions in veterans&rsquo; hospitals forced Rankin to announce two weeks ago that the Committee would hold open hearings on the charges made against the Veterans Administration.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Reporter Indicted</h4>

<p class="fst">Called before the House Committee on May 18, Deutsch was not permitted to give the facts as to overcrowding, inadequate treatment, etc., which he had gathered in his five-month survey. Challenged by Rankin for the names of his informants in the veterans&rsquo; hospitals, Deutsch refused to . give their names, saying that he feared there might be reprisals against them. Rankin then set the machinery in motion for instituting criminal proceedings against Deutsch.</p>

<p>Victor Maisel, who wrote the expos&eacute; of veterans hospitals called <strong>Third Rate Medicine for First Rate Men</strong>, which appeared in the March and April issues of <strong>Cosmopolitan</strong>, is also scheduled to testify before the Rankin Committee. A student of military medicine and author of <strong>The Wounded Get Back</strong>, Maisel contrasts the skillful care given to wounded soldiers in Army hospitals with the ill-treatment of discharged servicemen in veterans&rsquo; hospitals. The decline in the death rate of wounded fighting men from 8.1 per cent in World War I to 3.3 per cent in this war bears out the truth of Maisel&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;endless resources and priceless skill combine to give our sick and wounded the best that modern medicine can provide.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;But I have been shocked and shamed to discover,&rdquo; Maisel goes on to say &ldquo;that these servicemen &ndash; changed only because after long service, they have received a veteran&rsquo;s honorable discharge &ndash; are suffering needlessly and all too often dying needlessly in our veterans&rsquo; hospitals.</em></p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;Yes, our disabled veterans are being betrayed by the incompetence, bureaucracy and callousness of the Veterans Administration.&rdquo;</p>
