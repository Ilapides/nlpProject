<p class="fst">Even ultra-reactionary Representative John Rankin has been finally driven to admit there are some &ldquo;defects&rdquo; in the administration of veterans&rsquo; hospitals. In an obvious attempt to counteract the bad publicity his House Committee on World War Veterans Legislation has been receiving lately, Rankin introduced a bill into the House on May 25, proposing some mild &ldquo;reforms&rdquo; of the Veterans Administration hospital system.</p>

<p>But when newspapermen, veterans and members of their families criticized the terrible conditions in veterans&rsquo; hospitals and demanded a clean-up of the Veterans Administration, they were smeared by the poll-taxer from Mississippi as &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo; or &ldquo;insane.&rdquo; The so-called House investigation into the situation in veterans&rsquo; hospitals was an attempted whitewash of Veterans Administration officials. <em>The &ldquo;investigation&rdquo; was undertaken by the Rankin-led Committee in March in order to head off the real expose of conditions in veterans&rsquo; hospitals which would have followed had an impartial committee been named to investigate the floods of complaints which have been pouring in on members of Congress.</em></p>

<p>Public pressure did not permit a routine whitewash of the Veterans Administration. Writers like Albert Deutsch of <strong>PM</strong>, Victor Maisel of <strong>Cosmopolitan</strong>, Leo Egan of the <strong>N.Y. Times</strong> had reported such shocking facts about the mistreatment of sick and wounded veterans that Rankin&rsquo;s Committee was forced to hold open hearings. The first outside witness called, Albert Deutsch, was not allowed to present facts about overcrowding, inadequate treatment, etc., which he had gathered in a five-month survey of veterans&rsquo; hospitals. Because he refused to give the names of doctors who had supplied him with information, Deutsch was cited by the House Committee on May 18 for &ldquo;contempt of Congress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such tactics were too obvious, however. Under pressure, other members of the House Veterans Committee demanded that Victor Maisel be permitted to testify. But they have not yet been able &ndash; or are not willing &ndash; to get a reversal of the contempt charge against Deutsch. In a <strong>PM</strong> editorial on May 24, Rankin is quoted as saying that he was going to let the Deutsch case &ldquo;cool and cool and cool.&rdquo; Meantime the contempt charge against Deutsch stands.</p>

<p>Testifying before the House Committee on May 23, Victor Maisel produced a mass of evidence, substantiating that thousands of patients in veterans&rsquo; hospitals are being neglected, underfed and often mistreated. This was only a small part of the voluminous evidence against Veterans Administration heads which Maisel had presented in his article called <em>Third Rate Medicine for First Rate Men</em> (March and April issues of <strong>Cosmopolitan</strong>).</p>

<p>Despite all of the documented proof offered by this witness concerning the ill-treatment of veteran patients, Rankin concluded his grilling of Maisel with a violent outburst: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done a great disservice to the greatest system of veterans&rsquo; hospitals the world has ever seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>But only two days later, Rankin himself offered his bill, which he admitted had been drawn up in cooperation with Brigadier General Frank Hines, the Veterans Administrator.</em> According to an analysis of the bill by Deutsch in the May 28 <strong>PM</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;The Rankin bill is a small step in the right direction. But it provides no fundamental reform. It sidesteps the real issue &ndash; the need for a thorough-going housecleaning of the Veterans Administration medical and hospital program from top to bottom.&rdquo;</p>
