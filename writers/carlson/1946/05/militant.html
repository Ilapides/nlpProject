<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1946/index.htm#m46_21" target="new">Vol. X No. 21</a>, 25 May 1946, p.&nbsp;6.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">In his <strong>Principles of Psychology</strong> the well-known American scientist William James, offers his readers some very sound advice on the way to build up good habits. There must be a close connection between thought and action, writes psychologist James. The person who is always filled with noble thoughts which he never translates into action is in danger of losing his &ldquo;effort-making capacity,&rdquo; he warns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never let a fine glow of feeling evaporate without having some practical consequence&rdquo; is the way William James puts it. We pass this advice on to the readers of <strong>The Militant</strong>. We think that it&rsquo;s good psychology.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4><em>Militant</em> Exposes Capitalist Crimes</h4>

<p class="fst">Week after week, you read your copy of <strong>The Militant</strong> and are filled with righteous indignation at the stories that you find there &ndash; stories that are not found in the daily papers. You read of the latest mine disaster in McCoy, Virginia, in which 12 workers lost their lives and are outraged at the greed of the mine operators who value profits above human life.</p>

<p>And you read each week in Charles Jackson&rsquo;s column of the brutal indignities that are inflicted on America&rsquo;s Negro people &ndash; the latest being the Columbia, Tennessee, outrage.</p>

<p>When you read these weekly recitals of poverty and misery, suffering and oppression, you shake your head in anger and say: &ldquo;Something should be done about these things!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong><em>The Militant</em> is doing its part!</strong> Each week we are now bringing tens of thousands of workers the story of capitalist cruelty and violence.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Do Your Part!</h4>

<p class="fst">What about you? You have probably noticed that we are now conducting a <strong>Militant</strong> Sustaining Fund Drive. This is to help us continue and improve our work in spreading the message of revolutionary socialism. Each week during the drive, we are running a blank form at the bottom of page 6, which is headed &ldquo;I WANT TO HELP!&rdquo; This is included for the use of readers who want to help us in our work of exposing the capitalists and organizing the drive of the working people against them.</p>

<p>When the reading of the stories in this week&rsquo;s <strong>Militant</strong> arouse your burning anger, don&rsquo;t lay down the paper without taking steps to translate that fine feeling into action. Fill in the blank on page 6 and send it in to <strong>The Militant</strong> along with a contribution &ndash; 25 cents &ndash; 50 cents &ndash; $1 &ndash; more if you can afford it. It will be very well received and used by your fellow-workers on The <strong>Militant</strong>.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s good psychology for you!</p>
