<p class="fst">While I was visiting in St. Paul at Christmas time, my attention was attracted by a small item in the <strong>Pioneer Press</strong> about racial discrimination in Duluth. It appears that this northern Minnesota resort city had invited the United Nations Organization to establish its world headquarters there.</p>

<p>Knowing that the delegates from India have forced the UNO to turn down the bids of the South&rsquo;s Jim Crow cities, the Duluth Chamber of Commerce had listed as a prime attraction that &ldquo;racial discrimination is unknown in Duluth.&rdquo; The newspaper story reported that this statement had been challenged by the St. Paul Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Truth</h4>

<p class="fst">I called Reverend Clarence Nelson, the President of the St. Paul Branch, to get &ldquo;the news behind the news.&rdquo; He told me that he had had some personal experiences with Duluth&rsquo;s claimed hospitality to colored visitors. The telegram, which he sent to the Duluth Chamber of Commerce on December 22 tells the story:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Surprised at your statement in cable to the UNO that &lsquo;racial discrimination unknown in Duluth.&rsquo; Discrimination prevalent in large hotels there. Mrs. Nelson and I had our vacation ruined by being discriminated against in a hotel there in October. Reservations were cancelled at another hotel when management was informed that we were Negroes. Suggest that you find out the facts about discrimination in Duluth.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="fst">All that remains to be said is that the Duluth trip was to have been a &ldquo;second honeymoon&rdquo; for the Nelsons.</p>

<p>And the hotel which denied them their rights was &ndash; the LINCOLN HOTEL!</p>
