<p class="c">Has peace come to Northern Ireland at last?
<em>Eamonn McCann</em> and <em>Goretti Horgan</em> report from Derry and
explain who benefits from the IRA ceasefire and look to a different
solution</p>

<p class="fst">THE VERDICT of the Irish media on the IRA ceasefire was virtually
unanimous: the gun has been taken out of Irish politics. It&#8217;s not
true, of course.</p>

<p>There are still guns on the streets here, still men in uniform
eyeing you along their rifle sights as you walk past. The RUC and the
British army are still stopping and searching, still harassing young
people, even still carrying out house searches. But, Secretary of
State Patrick Mayhew tells us, the security forces <em>have</em>
responded to the ceasefire &#8211; the soldiers now wear berets instead
of helmets when they&#8217;re on patrol ...</p>

<p>Still, most working class people here greeted the ceasefire with a
sense of relief. For people in Catholic areas, there was also a sense
of <em>release</em>, from a burden which many had found harder to bear
than they&#8217;d been able easily to acknowledge. Some may have been
celebrating a step towards freedom which they believed had been won
by the armed struggle, but there was also celebration of freedom <em>from</em>
the armed struggle.</p>

<p>The anti-IRA propaganda which has passed for news coverage in much
of the media the past 20 years and more has involved the demonisation
not just of IRA activists but of the communities in which the IRA was
rooted. &#8216;IRA supporters&#8217; have been presented as having minds of
dark malice which brighten only with glee at somebody on &#8216;the other
side&#8217; suffering, which is very far from the truth.</p>

<p>For the people of places like the Falls, the Bogside or Ardoyne,
the waging of the armed struggle in their midst has meant tension and
danger, fear of being harassed and, if they are parents, of their
children being harassed and reacting to the harassment by joining the
IRA and running the real risk of death or desperately long sentences
in prison. So the first reaction to the ceasefire was heartfelt
relief. That, as much as a sense of being on the way to some hazily
defined &#8216;victory&#8217;, lay behind the euphoric crowd scenes which
greeted the ceasefire announcement. Support for the IRA has been a
more complicated and ambivalent and in conventional terms more decent
phenomenon than is frequently suggested.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also the case that &#8211; while there are vicious little
bastards everywhere and people on the Falls and in the Bogside who in
their own minds have reduced Protestants to an abstraction and who
may even have reckoned that the Provos were too &#8216;soft&#8217; in their
targeting &#8211; many of the people who have supported the IRA have had
a struggle within themselves when cruel things have been done, as it
were, on their behalf.</p>

<p>Few, if any, welcomed the Enniskillen atrocity, the Shankill bomb
or the individual killings of Protestants with some unremarkable
association with the RUC or British Army. Many who hated this
infliction of grief on decent people nevertheless couldn&#8217;t bring
themselves to join in the instant denunciations of media moralists
who had no problem with political killings in other contexts.</p>

<p>The IRA was, and is, generated from within the Catholic working
class community, precisely by the pressures the community was put
under. There was a sort of duty placed upon people by that
consideration which has now been lifted, and they walk with a lighter step.</p>

<p>There are some, and they are right, who have doubts about what is
on offer in return, but no powerful faction emerged to argue that
continuation of armed action was the best way to win more. That
reflected another emerging element in Catholic working class
attitudes &#8211; the feeling that the armed struggle had become
counter-productive to the interests of the community in whose name it
was being waged.</p>

<p>The Republican leadership&#8217;s alternative &#8216;unarmed strategy&#8217;
is based on an alliance with the SDLP, the Dublin government
(particularly the Fianna Fail element of it) and the Irish-American
lobby around Clinton to which Sinn Fein has been promised direct
access. This is an impressive line up in terms of establishment
political clout, and the Republicans affect confidence that it can
push the nationalist cause ahead. But it is a coalition which can
only hold together within the confines of a conservative agenda, and
that&#8217;s already been reflected in small but not insignificant
adjustments in Republican perspectives.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst">WHEN THE American ambassador to Dublin, Joan Kennedy Smith,
visited Derry some months ago local Republicans were <em>instructed</em>
not to join in any protests against US imperialism in Somalia and
threats to bomb Bosnia. And nowadays, when elected Sinn Fein
representatives talk about the Coalition government in the South,
it&#8217;s not to castigate Labour for being in league with the right
wing Fianna Fail party but to predict, not entirely tongue in cheek,
that the next Coalition could be between Fianna Fail and Sinn Fein.</p>

<p>So far, the Dublin government has done better out of the &#8216;peace
process&#8217; than anyone else. Commentators who have argued that
Reynolds was moving dangerously fast in inviting Adams to meet him
within a week of the ceasefire and then authorising a meeting between
government officials and a Sinn Fein delegation a week later are
missing the point or contriving to confuse it. Reynolds wanted Adams
into Government Buildings without any delay so as to have it publicly
made clear that Sinn Fein now accepts that authority of the Dublin
government. He knows what an enormous move away from Republican
orthodoxy this is.</p>

<p>It is also clear that the continued goodwill of what we might call
&#8216;official Irish America&#8217; &#8211; Kennedy, Moynihan, Bruce Morrison &#8211;
towards the Republican movement is now effectively conditional on the
Republicans staying on side with Reynolds. Visas to the US for
Republicans, and access to centres of power in the US, are
essentially in Reynolds&#8217;s gift. The Provos have been put on their
best behaviour and Albert Reynolds is to be the judge of their behaviour.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst">THIS IS NOT to suggest that rank and file Republicans here would
accept instructions from Reynolds on how to campaign on a number of
issues most immediate to them; on nationalist rights within the
North, border roads, harassment or miscarriages of justice.</p>

<p>But the Fianna Fail leader must be confident that if it ever comes
to a crunch, he has the whip hand. He could snatch away from them in
an instant all, or almost all, that they have gained in terms of
their political standing and international credibility. This may not
be the path rank and file Republicans want to take, or believe they
are taking, but for a certainty it is the path Reynolds thinks he has
enticed them along, and he is determined they won&#8217;t stray easily
off the path.</p>

<p>This is what Reynolds, a millionaire businessman with a
well-earned reputation for shiftiness, will have meant when he said
that the Republican ceasefire and the political realignment it
prompted was &#8216;the pinnacle of my career&#8217;. He was referring not to
the achievement of &#8216;peace&#8217; but to his success where his Fianna
Fail predecessors de Valera, Lemass, Lynch and Haughey had all failed
&#8211; in bringing Sinn Fein and the IRA to an acceptance of the
legitimacy of the Southern state and the consequent right of the
government of the state to be seen as the &#8216;official&#8217; leadership
of all Irish nationalists, North and South. In historical terms this
is a real gain for the Southern state and its government. And in the
process, the international standing of the Dublin government &#8211; the
fact, for example, that Washington now tilts towards Dublin rather
than London in determining policy towards the North &#8211; has been
significantly boosted. It marks the biggest gain anyone has so far
made from the Northern Troubles.</p>

<p>The nationalist politics of the Republican movement, putting class
questions on the long finger until the &#8216;national question&#8217; is
resolved, made this inevitable. Within the limits of nationalism the
choice facing the overwhelmingly working class Republican
constituency, was between a continuation of the armed struggle and an
all class alliance under the leadership of the Dublin government.</p>

<p>Given the dominance of nationalist ideas within the Catholic
working class it was predictable that in the immediate euphoric
aftermath of the ceasefire announcement it would be hard to find an
audience for advocacy of any alternative to this alliance. But we
live in fast changing times, and already there&#8217;s an undertow of
uneasiness about where we are headed, and a dawning realisation that
the prizes which were promised if &#8216;the violence&#8217; was called off
may be longer in coming than was anticipated.</p>

<p>This is true even in strictly nationalist terms. The Reynolds
government may feel able to take a tougher line with London, but it
is not after conflict with the British but an enhanced role in the
North in partnership with the British. Reynolds, in a recent
interview with the <strong>Observer</strong> made it plain that he didn&#8217;t foresee a united Ireland for a
generation at least.</p>

<p>Martin McGuinness expressed himself &#8216;surprised and disappointed&#8217;
at this approach. He would have been disappointed, naturally. But he
shouldn&#8217;t have been surprised.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst">INTERNATIONAL kudos apart, the big bonus for Dublin is that the
North, if the &#8216;peace process&#8217; were to come to full fruition, will
pose no threat to the South. As little as ten years ago virtually
everyone who wanted an end to the sectarian state up here was at
pains to explain that they were not out to extend the remit of the
South across the whole island, that, on the contrary, what was wanted
was a new Ireland altogether, fundamentally different from society as
it stood on the other side of the border. Generally speaking, those
in the South who wanted to get to grips with the North were also
involved in campaigning for radical social change within the South.
But in the present &#8216;process&#8217; Southern engagement with the North
is controlled precisely by the Southern establishment. No wonder the
mainstream Southern media, including elements bitterly hostile to
Reynolds across a range of other issues, are now almost embarrassing
in their support for him on the North. A Nobel Prize indeed! &#8216;Man
of history&#8217; indeed!</p>

<p>Putting the dismantling of the Northern state in the context of
fundamental transformation of the whole island may have cut little
ice with most Protestant workers over the past 20 years, but at least
it focused attention on the social content of the society which was
envisaged as emerging from the Troubles. It put the Falls in a
position, potentially anyway, to discuss with the Shankill what sort
of society might suit both. But that&#8217;s right off the agenda of the
process we are now going through. It&#8217;s taken for granted that what
suits one community will discommode the other.</p>

<p>The rioting on Protestant working class streets in Belfast reveals
that many there see it this way, too. To be sure, there have been
Loyalist paramilitaries stirring the violence up, motivated by
murderous hatred of Catholics. But there&#8217;s also the fact that the
Protestant working class <em>has</em> been deserted by Britain &#8211; and
has been told, almost in so many words, that as a result things will
get worse for them, not better, especially as compared with the Catholics.</p>

<p>All this fits in with what the British ruling class wants. Britain
wants out of its present entanglement with the North. It wants an end
to the opprobrium it experiences worldwide over censorship, shoot to
kill, the endless miscarriages of justice and so on. It wants to cut
back on the huge subvention to the North. But it is at one with
Reynolds in not wanting out <em>now</em>. It will be happy to work with
its Southern Irish counterpart in devising a form of power sharing in
the short term.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst">WITHIN THE North a settlement on these lines will represent
advance mainly for the middle classes, particularly the growing
Catholic middle class whose political ambitions can find an outlet in
a new Stormont assembly and its &#8216;power-sharing&#8217; executive and
whose &#8216;sense of identity&#8217; will be recognised both in the
all-Ireland dimension and in other measures which it will be no
problem for the British to accept. Formal recognition of the Irish
language, for example, will cost next to nothing, in monetary or any
other terms.</p>

<p>Most of the talk of a &#8216;peace dividend&#8217; has been effectively
about a negative dividend. Economists are agreed that any money saved
by the British government on security is unlikely to be kept here.
And the money promised by Clinton and the EU for &#8216;reconstruction&#8217;
will go mainly to tourism and employment schemes which are
notoriously poorly paid.</p>

<p>In this situation, the settlement envisaged will not end but
institutionalise sectarianism. Catholic workers will continue to live
on Catholic housing estates, Protestant workers on Protestant
estates. Protestant workers&#8217; children will continue to go to
Protestant schools, Catholic children to Catholic schools. And every
decision taken by the new assembly will be judged on a sectarian basis.</p>

<p>There will be demands that every low paid job that US investment
creates on the Falls is balanced by one on the Shankill, that every
penny of &#8216;aid&#8217; on one side is matched on the other. By the same
token, politicians on each side will squabble about fair shares of
suffering as cut backs and redundancies continue in existing
employments and services. All this could happen &#8216;peacefully&#8217;, of
course, but not only would it be a poor sort of peace for us to
stumble into in the shadow of the mountain of misery which has
accumulated over the past 25 years, it would be the peace of
sectarian stalemate, and always with the potential to flare up into
fighting again.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be like this. There <em>are</em> other
alternatives. Even today Catholic and Protestant workers do work side
by side for the same goals. We do it every day in our offices, our
factories, our hospitals. Cuts, privatisation, redundancies affect us
all and if we fight back, we have to fight back together.</p>

<p>The way forward is to link these struggles to a campaign of mass
opposition to the continued presence of the troops and the RUC. Over
the past month Sinn Fein in the North has encouraged a &#8216;return to
the streets&#8217;, marches on barracks and initiatives to open border
roads sealed off by the British army for more than 20 years, and
lively demonstrations outside watch towers and check points
positioned to use working class communities as human shields. While
there&#8217;s been a certain element of cynicism in this &#8211; Sinn Fein
had to offer its followers activity in order to win their support for
the new strategy &#8211; any shift towards mass action is a welcome step
forward. But a contradiction looms which the Republican movement will
be unable to avoid. The street activity can be seen as a cover for
political retreat. And the main perspective now is not for mass
action anyway, but for consolidation of the alliance with
establishment elements.</p>

<p>The new Republican buzz word, the demand on the placards at the
demonstrations, is &#8216;demilitarisation&#8217; &#8211; a vague term, but one
which clearly falls short of what the mainly young people who have
been mobilised have in mind, which is troops out now. Socialists have
to explain that the pull back from <em>that</em> position is part and
parcel of the alliance with Reynolds, and that the only way to press
on with the demand for an unconditional British withdrawal and the
dismantling of the Northern state is to reject the all class alliance
and to link up instead with workers across both the divide in the
North and the border.</p>

<p>This argument won&#8217;t be won in the abstract. But it will become
more winnable in the months to come than at any time in the last
couple of decades, if it is advanced in the context of involvement in
all the struggles of the working class here, both against the
sectarian state and across the range of &#8216;ordinary&#8217; class issues
which confront workers here.</p>

<p>The choice facing the Falls is whether to link up with Reynolds at
the cost of reining in the demand for an end to the Northern state,
or to reach out to the Shankill while pressing on with the struggle
for a socialist society across the whole island.</p>
