<p class="fst">BRIGHTON SOCIALIST Party members were shocked and saddened to hear
of the sudden death of Rod Fitch.</p>
<p>Rod moved to Northampton some years ago although he always looked
us up when he came back to visit his family.</p>
<p>Rod was a tireless fighter on behalf of the working class. He was
active as a supporter of <strong>Militant</strong> [<em>Ed.:</em> now Socialist
Party] in Brighton Kemptown Labour Party and became its parliamentary
candidate in 1983. Standing on socialist policies Rod achieved the
best vote for Labour in a region which saw the biggest swing to the
Tories after the Falklands&#8217; War victory. He received a tumultuous
standing ovation from hundreds of supporters at the count. He was
source of inspiration to us all.</p>
<p>Perhaps Rod will be best remembered for his anti-fascist work. Rod
was able to bring together representatives of our local Jewish and
Asiacommunities with the labour movement. The growth of the fascists
and their intimidatory marches and public sale of racist literature
was dispersed and brought to an end by the large mobilisations of
anti-fascists which Rod organised.</p>
<p>Rod will be sadly missed and remembered with affection here in
Brighton. Our condolences and deepest sympathy to his family.</p>
