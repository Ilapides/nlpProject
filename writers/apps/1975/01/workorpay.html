<br />
<p class="fst"><em>Unemployment is rising at an alarming rate. Official figures,
delayed through action by Government clerical workers, thinly
disguise the spectre stalking millions of worker&#8217;s homes.</em></p>
<p><em>Estimates of three quarters of a million already on the dole
have been made. The West Midlands Confederation of British Industry
are making &#8216;contingency plans&#8217; for one million out of work.</em></p>
<p>But these numbers are daily supplemented by those on short time
working. The <strong>Daily Mirro</strong>r (11/1/74) said that &#8220;thousands of
firms are putting their staffs on short time working ... hundreds of
thousands of people are now working a four and a three day week. And
some firms are openly saying that their workers may have to go on a
two day week.&#8221;</p>
<p>This means that millions of working class people face sharp cuts
in income. Overtime, on which millions rely for a living wage, is
being cut back on a wide-scale.</p>
<p>At the same time, prices are increasing faster than ever. The
<strong>Daily Mirror</strong> <em>Shopping Clock</em> passed &#0163;9 &#8211; their basket
of groceries now costs 83&#0189;p in the pound more than in November 1970!<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Prices</h4>
<p class="fst">Price increases in the pipe line are immense. Fuel, transport,
post and the passing on to the workers of increased prices in the
nationalised industries as a result of the budget, will al pinch hard
in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>Against this background, Denis Healey, Chancellor of the Exchequer
in a Labour Government, had the affrontery to say:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is far better that more people should be in work,
even if that means accepting lower wages on average, than those who
are lucky enough to keep their jobs should scoop the pool while
millions are living on the dole.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">To those just laid off, such words must seem bitter mockery.
&#8220;Lucky enough to keep their jobs!&#8221; What a phrase for a Labour
Minister to use! It&#8217;s straight out of the book of the employing
class who think they are doing the workers a favour by providing them
with work. No wonder it was so warmly received in those circles!</p>
<p>Neither is it accidental that the speech was made only hours after
Healey and Wilson had met the CBI leaders, who left the meeting
saying they felt &#8220;optimistic and encouraged.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they should be when Labour leaders are so pliable as to dance
directly to their tune!</p>
<p>To use Healey&#8217;s own words, &#8220;That is what the social contract
is all about.&#8221; All the discussions about the need to &#8220;strengthen
its guidelines&#8221; comes down to that. In the eyes of Big Business,
workers&#8217; standards have not been held back enough. Mounting
pressure is on the Labour Government to hold back wages by one means
or another. The threat of massive unemployment is an additional whip
to crack over the heads of workers considering how to maintain their
living standards.</p>
<p>The <strong>Sun</strong> newspaper spells it out:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Increased welfare benefits, full employment,
maintained living standards and a wages free-for-all, however
desirable, are too many sacred cows ... Something has to go ...
so-called &#8216;free collective bargaining&#8217; is the least important.&#8221; (11/1/74).</p>
<p class="fst">A clamour about the dangers of recession, bankruptcies and
horrific levels of unemployment is reaching deafening proportions.
But what is never said is this: whose crisis is it? If the rich few
who own and control productive industry in Britain who in fact
control society, face a crisis, then why should the working class be
presented with the bill?</p>
<p>Through the mass media the workers are alternatively cajoled then
threatened, in a process designed to prepare them to accept lower
standards. That is the essence of Healey&#8217;s speech. And all this is
to prop up a system which can offer no future to working people in
Britain or internationally.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Europe</h4>
<p class="fst">It may seem surprising but the rate of unemployment (officially
and before Christmas) was lower in Britain than in almost any other
capitalist country in Europe apart from Sweden. Even Australia has an
admitted rate of over 4% &#8211; a post war record.</p>
<p>More than anything, that reflects the power of the trade union
movement in Britain to resist redundancies. But now the dam is
beginning to leak. No longer can the bosses hold back from attempting
to enforce their will.</p>
<p>This enormous power, just hinted at by the Shrewsbury lobby (see
other report) can and must be mobilised to enforce <em>its</em> will.
No level of unemployment is acceptable; neither are lower wages. If
the bosses cannot even guarantee a full weeks&#8217; work then the
leaders of the trade unions, and of the movement in general must use
that as an argument to expose the rottenness of the whole capitalist system.</p>
<p>Already some trade union leaders have begun to echo the fears and
anger of their members. Healey&#8217;s speech was repudiated by Jack
Jones, Hugh Scanlon and Clive Jenkins along with numerous other trade
union leaders and left wing MP&#8217;s. But what they have not done is
campaign to explain that the threat to jobs and standards follows
directly from the crisis of the capitalist system and consequently,
mobilise the movement around a socialist programme to take society
out of the hands of the rich and put it into the hands of working people.</p>
<p>It is not enough to lambaste Healey and the other Labour leaders
for giving in to the pressure of the bankers and businessmen. What
else would they do if, as they do, they start from the position of
defending the so called &#8216;mixed economy&#8217; which again and again has
been proved to mean the rule of a handful of big monopolies?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Profits</h4>
<p class="fst">Big Business invests and produces for a profit. If profits are
squeezed, then they will cutback. But profit is the unpaid labour of
the working class, and so to increase profits it is necessary to hold
down real wages and social spending (Increased profits on the basis
of raising &#8216;productivity&#8217; through new investment raises exactly
the same question. They will only invest if they are confident of the
future profits).</p>
<p>That is why the CBI were shouting so much before the budget which
handed them Â£1,600 million, now being paid for by the workers.</p>
<p>That is why to argue that the problem would be solved simply by
raising wages to increase consumption, as does Hugh Scanlon (echoed
in the editorial of the <strong>Morning Star</strong> on Monday, January 13th)
is insufficient.</p>
<p>The reaction of workers is to fight redundancy with any weapon at
hand; to demand work sharing; if necessary to occupy the factory. But
the demand for work-sharing under present conditions faces us with
the furious resistance of the bosses to such measures. Their idea is
to &#8216;share out the misery&#8217; &#8211; among the workers, not including
themselves they would hasten to add. Socialists would argue for no
redundancies, sharing the work and no loss of pay &#8211; at a minimum a
guarantee of average earnings including overtime.</p>
<p>Although the question has been taken up by many union leaders who
declare opposition to redundancies, they fail to follow it through to
its conclusion &#8211; the need to nationalise the factories under
workers control and management as the only guarantee of jobs.</p>
<p>This allows capitalist &#8216;thinkers&#8217; like Peter Jay of the <strong>Times</strong>
to turn the argument on its head:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Given that limitation (e.g. the crisis in Britain) it
is argued the only way to keep unemployment in check, is to share the
available income and earnings and opportunities as evenly as
possible. One man&#8217;s pay increase becomes another man&#8217;s or his
own, unemployment&#8221; (14/1/75).</p>
<p class="fst">And the leadership of the Labour Party seem to substantially agree
with this!</p>
<p>The Labour movement has to answer with all its might that the
&#8216;limitation&#8217; of the capitalist system and its crisis are no
acceptable. If the employers cannot afford the worker to be shared
out with no loss of pay, then that is an argument for taking them
over, and running them in accordance with a democratic plan of production.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OPPOSE ALL REDUNDANCIES AND SHORT TIME WORKING</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>SHARE OUT THE WORK WITH NO LOSS OF PAY</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>NATIONALISE THE 250 MONOPOLIES WITH COMPENSATION PAID
ONLY ON THE BASIS OF PROVEN NEED</strong></li>
</ul>
