<br />
<p class="fst"><em>On Monday the Labour Party Conference took a vote in favour of
the &#8220;social contract&#8221; policy of the government. But this hid an
underlying mood of bitterness among delegates. This mood was
reflected particularly in the debates on unemployment and the cuts.
There is anxiety and confusion among the rank and file over what
programme and strategy should be adopted. It was exhibited in the
contradictions between the response of delegates to speeches from the
floor and some of the votes that followed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ted Mooney [Walton CLP]</strong> moved a composite on incomes policy
which called for a 35 hour week and &#0163;50 a week minimum wage tied to
the cost of living. He argued that no matter what the sacrifices
workers were called upon to make, the capitalists would not invest in
manufacturing industry. He quoted the <strong>Economist</strong>:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Industry may be deciding that it is mad to expand
capacity and employ more labour for a rate of return in profits
currently around 3&#8211;4%. Money put into gilts will effectively yield
13&#8211;14%.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst"><strong>Pat Wall [Shipley CLP]</strong> who is also President of Bradford
Trades Council, was given a tremendous ovation from conference. In a
fighting speech, he outlined how the social contract had resulted in
a 8% fall in living standards. Unemployment was now one million and a
half and still rising.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;None of the successive wage policies since 1961,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;has done anything to strengthen the economy or help the low
paid. Only the taking over of the commanding heights of the economy
could achieve the manifesto aim of a fundamental shift in the balance
of wealth and power in favour of working people.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst"><strong>Heather Rawling [Leceister South]</strong> and a member of the
Labour Party Young Socialists was also given resounding applause by
delegates. She called for socialist policies to deal with
unemployment. Unemployment had affected the youth very badly.
209,000 youngsters were on the dole. &#8220;It is bad enough,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;to be thrown on the scrap heap at 60 or 65. But at 16 it is
a real tragedy.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Bryan Stanley</strong>, on replying on behalf of the National
Executive, was forced to take up Pat Wall&#8217;s contribution. But he
did not name him. Stanley said that the claim that opposition to
government policy was building up in the rank and file was not true.
Bryan Stanley pointed to the support that the trade unions had given
to the policy. Some union conferences had voted for the social
contract against the advice of their own executives.</p>
<p>But what else could be expected when no alternative was put to
trade unionists? As they would see it, if they did not go along with
the policy, there would be anarchy, chaos and the return of a Tory
government. It was this trust and loyalty of workers that had been so
successfully played upon by the Labour and trade union leadership.
The &#8216;left&#8217; offered no alternative.</p>
<p>But now this situation was changing, the loyalty of the rank and
file is not a blind one. Every day that passes makes clear to workers
that the policy is a failure. Rather than solving their problems it
makes them worse.</p>
<p>The debate on the cuts coincided with lobbies outside against the
cuts and unemployment. It was a better indication of the future
fighting approach of the labour movement. A motion which rejected the
public expenditure cuts called for unity by the labour and trade
union movement to resist the cuts. This was carried despite the
attempts of the NEC to have it remitted.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Disillusionment</h4>
<p class="fst"><strong>Alan Fisher [NUPE]</strong> moving the composite, warned conference
that the cuts, if carried through, could lead to disillusionment.
This would lead to the destruction of the Labour Party at the next
General Election.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;There is no shortage of money to invest,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;the problem is to get that money directed into investment. To
bring this about there had to be public control of the banks and
financial institutions. If the cuts went ahead the resolutions passed
on pensions, health and education would not be worth the paper they
were written on. It will jeopardise the social contract. It will make
a major increase in unemployment.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst"><strong>Geoff Cuthbert [Cardiff North West]</strong> said that &#8220;on
travelling to Blackpool, I read in the paper that Jim Callaghan
referred to the NEC proposals on the nationalisation of the banks as
an &#8216;albatross around our necks.&#8217; I disagree with this, I believe
that an albatross is already there: the cuts in public expenditure.&#8221;
The composite called for Labour councils to refuse to implement the
cuts.</p>
<p>The speech by the <strong>Prime Minister, Jim Callaghan</strong>, on Tuesday
could have been made by a Tory or Liberal. There was not an atom of
socialism in anything he had to say. Even his attack on racialism
which drew the only enthusiastic applause from the delegates was
followed by a call for strict control over immigration. He obviously
intends to carry out Tory policies in the interests of the capitalist system.</p>
<p>At one point in his speech he asked delegates to hold on to their
seats in order to take in what he was about to say. He said:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The willingness of industry to invest is due partly to
overcoming inflation but also depends on industry being left with
sufficient funds and I mean by that that they are able to earn a
surplus which is an euphemism for saying that they must make a
profit. If industry cannot generate new funds to buy plant and
machinery we will not get any investment and Britain will continue to
go downhill.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Obviously Callaghan will pursue any policy in a pragmatic way that
he thinks will help to prop up capitalism. He does not consider the
cost to working people and the unity of the party.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Tribune Group</h4>
<p class="fst">Callaghan angered delegates when he made a disgraceful attack on
the elected NEC, the &#8216;Tribune Group&#8217; and the Labour Party Young
Socialists. This conflicted glaringly with his earlier statement that
he wanted the closest possible relationship between the party and the
government based &#8216;on mutual respect&#8217;. He said:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I believe that the relationship between the TUC and
the government has developed faster than the relationship between the
government and the NEC. But I do not want to retreat behind the stock
phrase that the government must govern and the NEC must go to hell.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">But there is blurted out precisely what he is saying! By &#8216;mutual
respect&#8217; he means &#8216;do what I say or else.&#8217; He suggested that
the NEC should include local government representatives on its body.
He said there should be an investigation by the party into so-called
&#8220;socialist sectarians&#8221; who have infiltrated the party. He said
nothing about the Liberals and the Tories who have infiltrated over
the years. Then he went on to say that he is not in favour of witch hunts!</p>
<p>He said &#8220;Is the party satisfied with the youth movement which
has only half the branches that it had ten years ago and is dominated
by a single brand of socialist sectarianism?&#8221; We might ask him if he
is satisfied with the loss of 16,984 members of the adult party since
1974, with many parties just shells of organisations and only 650,000
individual members out of a potential 11 million now organised in
trade unions who could be members?</p>
<p>Signs of the mood of the rank and file were expressed in the
stormy applause at the announcement that Norman Atkinson, the Tribune
MP, had defeated one of the main supporters of government policy,
Eric Varley, for the job of party treasurer. Also conference
overwhelmingly rejected the appeals of Reg Prentice and Frank Tomney
against the decision of their constituency parties not to reselect
them as candidates for the next election.</p>
<p>There was a big reception for the speech of Tony Benn. He said
that the party was &#8220;paying the price of thirty years playing down
the criticism of capitalism, while soft peddling its advocacy of
socialism. The socialist programme of nationalisation put forward in
the 1945 election united the party and led to an overwhelming victory
in those elections.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <strong>Militant</strong> meeting on Tuesday was packed out with over
two hundred delegates and visitors, some from the lobby that took
place against the cuts. &#0163;95 was raised for the Fighting Fund.</p>
