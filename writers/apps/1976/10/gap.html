<p class="fst"><em>The 1976 Conference must be seen as one of the most important
for decades. It marks a watershed in the development of the labour
movement and in the life expectancy of the Labour government itself.</em></p>
<p>An atmosphere of crisis permeated the Winter Gardens and the ghost
of Ramsay MacDonald haunted the corridors of the Imperial Hotel.</p>
<p>At the TUC conference opposition to government policy was
expressed in muted terms, and the social contract was endorsed by a
massive majority. In the eyes of the government the scheme must have
seemed to be set fair for the party conference. In advance
resolutions concerning mandatory reselection of parliamentary
candidates and resolutions on nationalisation of the big monopolies
had been removed from the agenda using the guise of the archaic
&#8216;three year rule&#8217;. With this example of blatant political
censorship and with careful stage management, the leadership hoped
that government policy would be endorsed by conference establishing
firmly the party leader.</p>
<p>After they had successfully defeated a number of attempts to get
the excluded resolutions back on the agenda, their hopes appeared to
be confirmed. They could not have been more wrong. The bitterness,
anger and frustration which has been building up in the ranks of the
movement could not be contained. It burst through time after time in
the course of the debates.</p>
<p>The decision to nationalise the top banks and insurance companies
cannot be overestimated. The National Executive document, despite the
abstention of the TGWU, GMWU and ASTMS, was carried by 3,314,000 to
526,000 &#8211; a six to one majority.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Mullins [Solihull]</strong> moved a resolution which called for
the whole of the banking and insurance industry to be brought into
public ownership. Referring to the NEC document, he pointed out that
this was the first time that the party had proposed to nationalise a
profitable sector of the economy. &#8220;The frothing at the mouth that
had followed the announcement of the nationalisation plans showed
that Labour had touched a raw nerve. For the monopolies have played
about in the currency markets and have made hundreds of millions of
pounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conference made their decisions despite enormous pressure. The
hysterical ranting of the City of London, the withdrawal of support
for the pound by the Bank of England, the blackmail by its
international counterparts, and the dire warnings of the Tory press
were all to no avail.</p>
<p><em>Tumultuous applause greeted the closing sentence of Mikardo&#8217;s
speech when he said &#8220;the Prime Minister said he will oppose the
proposals, I myself will support them, and that makes it one all. Now
I want Conference to score the winning goal&#8221;.</em><br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Prentice</h4>
<p class="fst">When the results was announced, the sombre face of Callaghan
contrasted starkly with the joyous feeling that spread through the
conference floor. An enormous unbridgeable gap has opened up between
the ranks of the movement and the right wing Cabinet led by Callaghan.</p>
<p>This was also demonstrated by the attempt to get Prentice
reinstated as the Parliamentary candidate for Newham North East led
by Frank Chapple from the EETPU. This move was rejected with a
derisory handful of votes in favour. Throughout conference
differences were expressed in a way not seen since the period 1929&#8211;31.</p>
<p>On the first day there is no question that the opponents of the
social contract won the argument. But the platform won the vote. <strong>Ted
Mooney [Liverpool, Walton]</strong> said inflation was running at a yearly
rate of 21% based on last month&#8217;s figures. This was despite two
years of wage restraint, which had led to a fall in living standards
of 8%. This showed that wage increases were not the cause of inflation.</p>
<p><strong>Mike Levene [Coventry South West]</strong> challenged Denis Healey&#8217;s
forecast of 6% growth. &#8220;This is completely utopian&#8221;, he said .
&#8220;And so was his forecast that unemployment would fall to 700,000 by 1978.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Pat Wall [Shipley]</strong> complained that successive incomes
policies and wage freezes since 1961 had done nothing to help the low
paid or strengthen the economy.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Social Contract</h4>
<p class="fst">Neither <strong>Bryan Stanley</strong> who replied for the National
Executive nor anybody from the rostrum denied these arguments.
Instead the platform invoked a theme they were to use again and again
during the conference &#8211; &#8216;Opposition to wage restraint or the
social contract would bring down the Labour government and let in the
Tories.&#8217;</p>
<p>But it is precisely these policies which are a sure recipe for the
defeat of a Labour government. Socialist policies would strengthen
that government. Nevertheless the burning anger about unemployment
mounted as delegate after delegate complained to the government for
allowing unemployment to rise to one and a half million. Delegates
demanded that the government take immediate action. As one pointed
out, determined action was supposed to have been taken to halt
unemployment under the terms of the social contract. But all the
contribution of Albert Booth, the Employment Minister, amounted to
was that &#8216;we are as worried as you are&#8217; &#8216;there are no easy
answers but we must stick to the social contract!&#8217;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Hostility</h4>
<p class="fst">The press deliberately distorted the mood at Conference. In the
main the reception given to Healey after his speech on the IMF loan
on Thursday was one of hostility, and the TV cameras must have had a
difficult job finding groups of delegates who could be viewed as
&#8216;enthusiastic supporters&#8217; of his speech. The attempt by some of
his Cabinet colleagues to stage a standing ovation fell flat.
Delegates were furious when Healey tried to save face and stood up
and waved his hands in the air like a victorious prize fighter for
the benefit of the TV cameras.</p>
<p>So too with Callaghan&#8217;s speech on Tuesday morning. The reception
could best be described as cool. It was a speech that was a throwback
to the days of Gaitskell. His pugnacious bully-boy arguments could
have been made by any Tory Prime Minister. The speech amounted to a
vigorous defence of the profit motive and a call for sweat, toil and
tears by the working class in order to save capitalism from collapse.</p>
<p><em>Eric Heffer put it at the Tribune Meeting: &#8220;What are members
of the National Executive to say to a speech which the <strong>Daily Mail</strong>
can represent as a speech that would have sounded well enough from a
Tory Prime Minister with his back to the economic wall.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The mood of delegates in itself was a reflection of the mood in
the CLPs and trade union branches. It built up to a crescendo in the
debate on cuts in public expenditure. The motion from the National
Union of Public Employees backed local councils which refused to cut
public expenditure and called for a campaign by the labour and trade
union movement against the cuts. It was carried by a large majority.
It was of enormous diplomatic importance, showing the contradictions
inherent in the political situation. On the one hand conference voted
for the maintenance of the social contract and on the other hand they
voted against one of its most important aspects in the eyes of the government.</p>
<p><em>Whatever the confusion it must be without precedent in the
history of the Labour Party that the party conference has
called on Labour councillors to refuse to implement the policies of
their own government!</em><br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Revolt</h4>
<p class="fst">This is another graphic illustration of the rising revolt of the
rank and file against the policies of the right wing Cabinet. Their
sole basis of support now resides in the Parliamentary Party.</p>
<p>This conference showed in outline many uncanny a parallel with the
period before the formation of the National government in 1931. There
were open clashes between left and right and violent altercations
between members of the NEC which were leaked to the press. There was
great disenchantment within the trade unions. There were heated
discussions in trade union delegations sometimes boiling over into
angry shouting matches. Rumour and counter rumour circulated the
hall. This was commented on by the Chairman in his closing remarks
and also in the press.</p>
<p><em>Conference is no more than a reflection of the processes
developing in the labour movement itself. It signposts the general
direction in which the labour movement in heading. The sign of this
year&#8217;s conference is unmistakable! &#8220;Warning coalition ahead!&#8221;</em><br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Spending Cuts</h4>
<p class="fst">Referring to the conditions required for the new &#0163;2,300 million
loan from the IMF, the <strong>Guardian</strong> on Friday said:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;There is much apprehension at Blackpool this week, as
much amongst the &#8216;social democrats&#8217; as on the left. A further
round of heavy spending cuts coming on previous cuts which all too
clearly have failed to deliver dividends in retaining confidence will
make it impossible for Mr Jones and Mr Foot to hold the line ...</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;... today they have all gone home from Blackpool
leaving behind a party more at war with itself than any time since
the days of Gaitskell ... the Prime Minister and the great majority
of his colleagues in the Cabinet and the Parliamentary Party are not
in business to proclaim the breakdown of capitalism and engineer the
arrival of a fully fledged socialist society. If that means civil
war, the government against the party, then so be it.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Conspiracy</h4>
<p class="fst">All this is a terrible warning to the ranks of the movement which
they will ignore at their peril. There is a substantial number of
Labour members of Parliament who would cross the floor of the House
and join the Tories without looking out of place. The conspiracies
against the labour movement that are taking place behind the scenes
will not be defeated by making concessions to the right wing. It is
only by the NEC alerting the party to these dangers and boldly
mobilising the ranks of the movement behind a socialist programme to
transform society, that the conspiracy to split the labour movement
can be defeated.</p>
