<p class="fst"><em>The 30th annual meeting of the Southern Region of the Labour
Party takes place in Worthing this weekend. The agenda reflects the
growing opposition from the rank and file to the policies being
carried out by the Labour government.</em></p>
<p>Cuts in public expenditure come in for the harshest criticism.
Resolution after resolution deplores the effect the cuts will have on
services and employment.</p>
<p>On unemployment, the motion from AUEW (TASS) no.&nbsp;26
Divisional Council, says that it &#8220;pledges increased support for the
campaign against unemployment and factory closures. The myth must be
shattered that unemployment is a necessary evil to solve the economic
problems of capitalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>An amendment from Eastbourne CLP outlines the way the fight
against unemployment should be developed:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We believe that redundancies can be halted by the
immediate nationalisation of factories threatening closure without
compensation and re-instatement of the workforce. We also demand the
opening of the books and work sharing with no loss of pay in the case
of redundancies without factory closures.</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;This economic crisis is the crisis of capitalism and
capitalism must pay for any hardship caused by redundancies or closures.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Eastbourne CLP also takes up the blocking role of the House of
Lords and calls for its abolition. The question of the democratic
control of Labour Members of Parliament is taken up by the New Forest
CLP who &#8220;endorse the view that Labour MPs and prospective
candidates should be subject to annual re-adoption.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fareham CLP in an amendment demands that MPs &#8220;should only
receive the average wage of a skilled worker as well as receiving
necessary expenses these to be audited by the labour movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hastings CLP condemns the Labour government for sending a
representative to the funeral of the fascist dictator Franco, and
calling for support to be given to the LYPS campaign on Spain.</p>
<p>There are a number of resolutions that call for a return to
Labour&#8217;s <em>Manifesto</em> and take up the question of wage
restraint in a capitalist society.</p>
<p>The amendment from Brighton Kemptown CLP to the resolution from
Portsmouth North, points the way forward for the labour movement.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Growing unemployment coupled with falling living
standards and collapsing social services demand emergency action. A
bold socialist programme is needed. This meeting calls for enabling
legislation to carry out the nationalisation with minimum
compensation under workers&#8217; control and management of the 200 or so
monopolies banks and finance houses which control the economy. The
investment strike, the anarchy and wastefulness of capitalism could
then be ended and replaced with a socialist plan of production which
would end the stupidity of 1&#0189; million unemployed at the same time as
plant lies idle and achieve an irreversible shift in the balance of
wealth and power in favour of working people and their families.&#8221;</p>
