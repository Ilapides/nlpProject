<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;We have done more from outside in a few short
months to reduce the influence of the left than the right wing of the
Labour Party has done in a decade.&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="fst">That was how Liberal leader David Steel summed up the results of
the Lib-Lab deal at the end of last week&#8217;s Liberal Conference.</p>
<p>Steel made no bones about which side of the class struggle he
stood on as he attacked the Labour Party Conference in advance for
what he called the Party&#8217;s &#8220;weak-kneed capitulation to the more
intolerant demands of trade unionism &#8211; imposed closed shops and the
extension of trade disputes by mass picketing.&#8221; For all the
sympathetic phrases these so-called Liberals use, Steel&#8217;s two
speeches at his Party&#8217;s Conference showed that when the chips were
down they stand for the maintenance of so-called &#8216;private
enterprise&#8217; dominated by big business. The only difference between
the Tories and Liberals were secondary differences, of the tactics
and the career interests of their leaders.</p>
<p>Other Liberal leaders made clear their hatred of the labour
movement. Liberal President Gruffydd Evans described the Labour Party
as &#8220;nothing more than an instrument organised often along Stalinist
lines.&#8221; Liberal chairman Geoffrey Tordoff spoke of the Liberals
fighting the &#8220;evil, dictatorial doctrine of Trotskyism&#8221;. He went
on to call for classic Tory policies like the &#8220;shifting of the
balance of taxation from direct to indirect.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Tail</h4>
<p class="fst">Steel&#8217;s earlier speech spoke of the &#8216;successes&#8217; that the
Lib-Lab pact have brought. He said:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We can and have stopped nationalisation ... We can and
will oppose those cuts in defence spending which would take us below
our obligations to collective security in NATO.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of this deal, Steel showed his underlying hatred of the
labour movement&#8217;s aim of transforming society when he claimed that
the &#8220;onward march of bureaucratic takeover and control remain the
aim of Labour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Steel summed up the period of the Deal as the time when &#8220;the
Liberal tail wagged the dog&#8221;! Thus he blurted out the truth about
this deal: the Liberals will only support the government so long as
it carries out capitalist policies. The labour leaders argue that as
the government is in a minority it has no alternative but to drop it
more radical policies and attempt to hang on until it stands a chance
of winning an election, and that the Deal only formalises the situation.</p>
<p>This is nonsense. The central questions facing the Party are: why
did we lose the majority which the Party won in October 1974, and
what should the government do now?</p>
<p>It is the failure of the government to deliver the goods it
promised in the 1974 elections which has caused the party to lose
both parliamentary and council elections. If the government continues
with its present policy of trying to manage the present diseased
capitalist economy it will be incapable of solving the problems
facing the working class and make it very difficult for Labour to win
the next election.</p>
<p><em>But the Liberals will only support the Labour government as
long as it continues to carry out the suicidal policy of working
within the existing economic structure.</em> If the Labour government
attempted to carry out radical measures, the Liberals would
immediately withdraw their support. This is precisely the Liberal
leaders&#8217; role; to act as a guard dog for big business, ensuring
that the government does not make any attempt to edge towards
anything that could be interpreted as socialism.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Alternative</h4>
<p class="fst">The policies which the Labour government has to carry out to
retain Liberal support are the direct opposite of those on which it
was elected. The way to ensure the survival of the government is not
for the Labour leaders to mortgage themselves to the Liberals, but to
adopt socialist policies capable of winning the mass support
necessary which alone can sustain a Labour government in office.</p>
