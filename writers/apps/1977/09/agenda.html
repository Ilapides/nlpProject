<p class="fst"><em>There is no doubt that the Labour government&#8217;s continuing
failure to fully carry out its election pledges, let alone even begin
to implement the promised &#8220;fundamental and irreversible shift in
the balance of wealth and power in favour of working people and their
families,&#8221; has deeply angered Labour Party members.</em></p>
<p>The continual flouting of Party Conference decisions by the
Parliamentary Party has made 83 Constituency Parties and NOLS send in
motions demanding automatic re-selection of Labour MPs between each
election. York CLP further demands that MPs should hand over &#8220;any
remuneration from any source over and above the average wage of a
skilled worker together with legitimate expenses&#8221; to the Labour
Party in attempt to stop careerists using the Labour Party as a
ladder to fortune and riches.</p>
<p>But as we have reported before, much of the Party members&#8217; anger
is not shown on the Final Agenda due to the right wing controlled
Conference Arrangements Committee ruling out of order 106 motions out
of the 524 originally submitted. It is not only Constituency Parties
which have suffered, unions like AUEW-Engineering Section, NUPE,
AUEW-TASS, and ACTT have had their resolutions chopped as the CAC has
tried to cut out the most critical resolutions.</p>
<p>This has resulted in a sharp drop in the number of resolutions in
some of the key areas, as this table shows:</p>

<p class="fst">They hope to remove the most severe criticisms of the government
and calls for socialist policies from the Conference floor.</p>
<p>But in spite of these manoeuvres (and an apparent effort by the
right wing &#8216;Campaign for a Labour Victory&#8217; to get a few motions
in) the overwhelming majority of the agenda is hostile to the
government&#8217;s policy.</p>
<p>Paisley CLP calls upon the Conference to reject the &#8220;government&#8217;s
economic strategy which has led to: (a) a totally unacceptable record
level of unemployment; (b) an average reduction in real wages of 12%
since January 1975; (c) inflation still running at 17%; (d) cuts in
public spending which have seriously damaged working class living
standards.&#8221; Coventry South East CLP adds in an amendment that these
policies have made possible &#8220;the return of a Thatcher or equally
reactionary coalition government.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>This motion</em> [no.&nbsp;36] <em>sees socialist policies &#8220;as
the only practical way out of the crisis&#8221; and calls for the
government to &#8220;implement Clause 4[IV] of the Party Constitution.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The growing calls for the government to stop carrying out
Tory-style economic policies is echoed in all the resolutions on the
Lib-Lab deal. Not a single resolution or amendment supports this
rotten pact. Brighton Kemptown CLP demands that the <em>&#8220;government
breaks the deal and ends all negotiations with pro-capitalist parties
and an end to pro-capitalist policies.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>All the motions in this section put forward the same call for the
Labour government to attempt to carry through Parliament socialist
policies. If, as is likely, such socialist measures are defeated in
the Commons then it would be necessary for the government to call an
election and clearly explain why it was essential to implement these
policies as the only way to fundamentally improve working people&#8217;s standards.</p>
<p>All the resolutions on unemployment reflect the labour movement&#8217;s
anger at the scandal of the ever-increasing number of unemployed.
Unfortunately the CAC has succeeded in cutting out most of the
resolutions putting forward a clear socialist, fighting programme
against unemployment, though the Manchester Central motion on Youth
Unemployment does put forward the demands of the Labour Party Young
Socialists and the Youth Campaign Against Unemployment.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that racialism will once again be a key issue at
the Conference, though the CAC has ruled out of order all the motions
supporting last year&#8217;s anti-fascist Conference policy, even the
Party Chairman&#8217;s own CLP has had its motion dropped! This has meant
that there is no comprehensive programme to fight the racists and
fascists in the motions. But Deptford CLP, which helped organise the
counter-demonstration against the National Front in Lewisham, has an
amendment down which calls on the labour movement to &#8220;organise
counter-demonstrations against provocative marches by fascists&#8221; and
for a Conference of Labour to be held to discuss how to defend
immigrants from attack.</p>
<p>The one section of the agenda where the CAC has done the least
damage is that on Northern Ireland, though it cut out a resolution
calling for the formation of a Trade Union Defence Force to defend
Catholic and Protestant workers. All the motions in this section call
on the Labour Party to help organise a conference of all labour
movement organisations &#8220;to establish a Labour Party&#8221; with a
<em>&#8220;programme capable of uniting Protestant and Catholic workers in
common struggle under the banner of socialism.&#8221;</em><br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Principles</h4>
<p class="fst">It is likely that the Labour leadership will attempt to mute the
Party&#8217;s criticism of the government&#8217;s performance by appealing
for party unity in the beginning of the run-up to the next election.
We are all in favour of unity, but unity around a programme that will
answer working people&#8217;s needs, not a programme which has meant a
million and a half unemployed, falling living standards and a
disastrous run of losses in the local and by-elections.</p>
<p>Party members will do well to remember the comment of Hugh Dalton
on the 1929&#8211;31 debacle of a Labour government that Labour members
<em>&#8220;should have kicked up more row, been less loyal to leaders and
more loyal to principles.&#8221;</em> No matter what tricks the CAC get up
to it is certain that this year&#8217;s Party Conference will see even
more demands from Labour&#8217;s ranks for socialist policies.</p>
