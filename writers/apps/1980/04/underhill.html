<p class="fst">The mood of the Southern Region Annual Conference of the Labour
Party was one of bitterness and anger at the Tory government, and a
determination to get rid of them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>However a number of delegates made clear that it was not enough to
rely on the unpopularity of the Tories, it was essential to build a
mass democratic Labour Party committed to socialist policies.</p>
<p>With this in mind, delegates rounded on the regional executive for
the evidence they wanted to submit to the commission of enquiry. This
included the abolition of the women&#8217;s section on the NEC, the LYPS
representative to be elected by the constituencies at the annual
conference, etc. As one delegate put it, these proposals are to the
right of the CLV.</p>
<p>A number of older delegates came to the rostrum to oppose what
they saw as a direct attack on the LYPS, the life-blood of the movement.</p>
<p>Ron Hayward representing the NEC presented <strong>Militant</strong>
supporter Cathy Wilson, Isle of Wight&#8217;s Labour candidate at the
general election, with the shield for the best performance on party
building, nearly 10% of the Labour vote at the election having joined
the Party.</p>
<p>There couldn&#8217;t be a better answer to the claim that Lord
Underhill (referred to as Lord Underhand by a delegate) has made that
<strong>Militant</strong> drives people out of the party.</p>
<p>In presenting the award, Ron said, &#8220;I wish your brand of
socialism and organisation would invade the mainland.&#8221;</p>
<p>A composite demanding all-out opposition to the cuts was passed by
an overwhelming majority. This composite called on the Regional
Council to inform all Labour groups and all Labour members on
regional and area health authorities that it is their role to oppose
cuts in their services, and to support trade union action against the cuts.</p>
<p>One indignant Labour councillor got to the rostrum protesting that
councillors didn&#8217;t need to be reminded of their duty. Another
councillor replied that this didn&#8217;t accord with his experience &#8211;
some needed to be reminded regularly (to loud cheers). &#8220;If we don&#8217;t
carry out party policy we should be kicked out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The composite&#8217;s concluding paragraph stimulated the largest part
of the discussion dealing as it did with the experience of the last
Labour government.</p>
<p>The dying remnants of the right wing, notwithstanding the fact
that a number of unions had come to the rostrum in support of the
composite, desperately tried to get 15 delegates with credentials to
stand for a card vote to be taken.</p>
<p>The chairwoman waited for what seemed like an age for the right to
muster their forces. One by one they got up until they reached the
grand total of eleven. To applause and cheers the conference declared:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;That the Labour Party must now reject the strategy
pursued by the last Labour government, of attempting to work within
and reform the present economic system, and instead campaigning for
the election of a Labour government committed to carrying out a
fundamental socialist change in society based on the public ownership
of all major industries, the banks and financial institutions, under
worker&#8217;s control and management.</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;Only then can a Labour government ensure investment in
industry and low interest rates, which can bring an improving
standard of living for ordinary people, together with full employment
and improved public services.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The <strong>Militant</strong> meeting held immediately after a long day at
conference attracted 46 delegates. &#0163;60 was raised for the fighting
fund. As for the CLV, their meeting was cancelled &#8211; a sign of the future.</p>
