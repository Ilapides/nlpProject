<p class="fst"><em>The Labour Party Conference meets only six weeks after the
General Election. But already it has been six weeks of storm and
stress.</em></p>
<p><em>Every worker will be looking to the conference for a lead. Its
main purpose must be to sum up the experience of those weeks, of the
election itself, and indeed of the seven months prior of Minority
Government.</em> It must draw a balance sheet of what has been
achieved: which commitments have been taken up, and which have been
shelved? On this basis the whole rank and file of the movement can
prepare themselves for the trials ahead.</p>
<p>Every delegate is conscious of the parlous state of the economy.
The rampant inflation, the beginnings of recession and lay-offs. The
crisis already being unloaded onto the backs of working people is
reaching frightening proportions.</p>
<p><em>The election resulted in a crushing defeat for the Tories &#8211;
35% of the poll, the lowest ever. Working people showed their hatred
for Heath and his backers &#8211; the gang of property swindlers,
speculators, monopolists and bankers.</em></p>
<p>The furore inside the Tory ranks since the election has led Walker
to warn them against further decline, pointing out that they have
been reduced to an &#8220;English Party&#8221;, only of the countryside and
the suburbs. Labour&#8217;s victory was solidly based on the industrial towns.</p>
<p>But the battering of the major party of the rich is small comfort
to the major party of the workers, when it could only get 40% of the
vote &#8211; less than in 1970 when they lost! <em>The major
responsibility for this must lie with the Labour leadership.</em></p>
<p>Without an enthusiastic campaign, with policies which could hardly
be distinguished from those of the Tories and Liberals, with calls
for sacrifice in the &#8216;national interest&#8217; was it so surprising
that millions of workers abstained, or voted for Nationalist or even
Liberal candidates?</p>
<p><em>Nevertheless, the conference meets under a Labour Government.
The attitude of the rank and file must be that &#8220;a majority of one
is enough&#8221;.</em> The manifesto commits them to an &#8220;irreversible
shift in the balance of power and wealth&#8221;. It is on that sort of
commitment and all the other measures in the interests of working
people, that the rank and file are pressing for action.</p>
<p>On the other side, exactly as we warned, like a pack of wolves,
the capitalists are snapping at the heels of the Labour leaders,
houding them along their path. In advance of the election the CBI set
up a hue and cry about the imminent bankruptcy of hundreds of
companies unless the Government took action to &#8220;restore profitability&#8221;.</p>
<p>To back this up these gentlemen who hurl abuse at workers
struggling for a living wage, organised their own &#8220;strikes of
capital&#8221;. Pilkingtons and Hawker Siddely, to name the most obvious,
openly blackmailed the Government by declaring an end to investment projects.</p>
<p>There has been a virtual &#8220;general strike&#8221; of investment over
recent months. The carefully timed reports of the CBI delivered the
day before the budget, forecast &#8220;that unless there were major
changes in Government policy, manufacturing investment next year
might show a dramatic decline of 10%.</p>
<p>And they talk of democracy! These handful of unelected directors
who control the boards of the big monopolies are dictating to the
Labour Government. They have shown their snarling teeth, when they
threaten massive unemployment if they are not given what they want.</p>
<p><em>But it has to be said that the Government has given in to this
blackmail.</em> What shop steward worth his salt would accept so
easily the &#8220;poverty pleading&#8221;, begging-bowl approach of the
management? <em>That is what has happened in Healey&#8217;s budget!</em></p>
<p>Lever, Williams, Wilson, Healey and other have all promised the
wolves their goodies would be delivered. Yes, they agree,
&#8220;profitability&#8221; must be restored.</p>
<p><em>The Queen&#8217;s speech excluding important proposals such as the
nationalisation of ports and road haulage was an ill omen.</em> It
opened the way for the entirely pro-capitalist budget.</p>
<p>Handouts of &#0163;1600m have been made to Big Business. They will flow
quickly, paid for directly or indirectly by the working class.
&#8220;Starving&#8221; capitalists will get their help immediately. The
crumbs left over for the working people in the form of family
allowances and pension increases will be delayed until the Spring.
Why? By then their value will have been much eroded. Isn&#8217;t the
&#8220;cash crisis&#8221; for pensioners and young families as important as
that of the bloated monopolists?</p>
<p>The real nature of this budget is shown by the hymns of praise to
Denis Healey in the pages of financial newspapers. &#8220;A budget to
keep business afloat&#8221; said the financial editor of the <strong>Times</strong>. &#8220;Long
Strides in the direction of tough orthodoxy ... the ordinary trade
union member and other worker is hit by almost every measure and
helped by virtually none&#8221; said Peter Jay, economics editor of the <strong>Times</strong>.</p>
<p>But the capitalists are not satisfied. They were bargaining for
&#0163;3,000 million. Half a loaf is better than none? Not for them,
already they have their eyes on the rest.</p>
<p><em>More, More, More, is their insistent theme.</em> They have got
the price code &#8220;relaxed&#8221;. As if it hadn&#8217;t nearly nodded off
already. So relaxed is it now that it will have lost what energy it
ever had to stop an avalanche of price increase this winter.</p>
<p><em>Between September and October prices rose by 2.3%, triggering
the final three thresholds. That&#8217;s an annual rate of over 40%.</em></p>
<p>Quite rightly the left wing Tribune group in parliament have
objected strongly to this budget. But what else could be expected on
the basis of capitalism? Their alternative, a National Enterprise
Board, would in no way touch the problem which faces the Government
and the whole movement &#8211; the colossal power of the 250 major monopolies.</p>
<p>It is they who hold the reins of power. An NEB would merely
irritate the capitalists, who have stated clearly on dozens of
occasions that they would sabotage it. Their power to do this can be
glimpsed at by the actions of their advance guard at Pilkingtons.</p>
<p>The Tribune MP&#8217;s would be pushed into the same positions as the
right wing if they remained within the framework of capitalism. While
the millionaires control the economy they will dictate policy. It is
only by mobilising the might of the movement that Labours policies
can be implemented.</p>
<p>A diseased broken down economy such as the British capitalists
have saddled the people with, demands that the working class pay the
price for its survival. Cuts in living standards of ten to twenty per
cent are what are needed, on a capitalist basis, to &#8220;restore
profitability&#8221;.</p>
<p>Crosland made a joke in Parliament about keeping rate increases to
100%. But its no joke for local authorities facing bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Prentice said in relation to the &#8220;social contract&#8221;, that it
applies &#8220;unhappily&#8221; to &#8220;school children as well ...&#8221;!</p>
<p>It just so happens that Newham, the borough in which Prentice&#8217;s
constituency lies, has come top of the list to qualify for special
help to its schools. A young teacher there told the <strong>Times</strong>
about truants ...</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I often find that the child just has not got the will
power to wake up in the morning. There are families of eight, nine,
ten children living in terrible conditions, fathers in prison, broken
homes, crumbling damp, rat infested terrace houses ... I keep a
supply of shoes, coats and anoraks. One kid didn&#8217;t turn up at
school for four days and then turned up in his mothers&#8217; boots.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Prentice would &#8220;suffer little children to make these
sacrifices&#8221; to prop up this rotten capitalist system! The budget
cuts spell disaster for the Newhams all over Britain.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Disaster</h4>
<p class="fst"><em>The road already taken by this Government leads to disaster.</em>
They have capitulated to the pressure of Big Business. But they will
not keep the capitalist wolves from the door &#8211; their appetite is
amazing! They are already howling for more cuts.</p>
<p><em>Above all they are plotting to bring down the Government when
the time is right.</em> All the weapons to stab it in the back are
being sharpened. The disarray of the Tories makes it necessary for
Big Business to wait a while. They intend to use the inactivity of
the Labour leaders and their carrying out of capitalism&#8217;s dirty
work to discredit them.</p>
<p>At a certain stagethey will start the well rehearsed campaign for
a &#8220;Government of National Unity&#8221;. Blaming the crisis on
&#8220;socialism&#8221; they will try to split the Labour Cabinet from top to
bottom and set up a National Government. Assisted by some of those
Labour leaders who feel more at home in a boardroom than a Labour
Party room, they would attempt to implement measures of austerity
which make the present budget look generous! It would be a savage
Tory Government in faint disguise!</p>
<p><em>There is only one way to avert the catastrophe!</em> Mobilise
the enormous strength of the movement to force through the programme.
Bob Cryer, MP for Keighley said &#8220;that a crisis should be a reason
for imposing Labour&#8217;s policies not running away from them.&#8221; Quite
right! But mobilising the whole movement against the capitalists&#8217;
resistance to take over the 250 monopolies is the only way Labour&#8217;s
policies can be implemented.</p>
<p>How easy it would be! Those faint hearts who fear socialist
policies should learn from the election work conducted by the Labour
Party Young Socialists. If the Labour Leaders were to explain that a
clique of monopolists were holding the country to ransom, that they
stood in the way of decent wages, secure jobs, decent education and
hospitals, the solution of the housing nightmare, overwhelming
support would be there to change society.</p>
<p><em>An enabling act through Parliament to nationalise the major
monopolies, with the compensation paid out according to need, would
be defended by the ten million strong movement and millions of others.</em></p>
<p>Instead of pussyfooting with utopian &#8220;planning agreements&#8221; a
real socialist plan of production of production could be introduced.
That could be explained in concrete terms: 100,000 building workers
out of work; 750,000 million bricks stockpiled and 30% brick making
capacity shut down; plus a worsening housing crisis add up to
capitalist stupidity. On the basis of a planned economy these
resources could be used to build one million houses a year and more.</p>
<p>Contrary to all pessimists, Britain is a wealthy country. Its
total wealth adds up to a staggering &#0163;400,000 million! With the
skill of its people, organised in the interests of need not profit, a
20 hour week could be introduced with production leaping ahead! The
tragedy is that a Labour Government &#8220;rules&#8221; while a handful of
parasites utilises the wealth for their own ends.</p>
<p><em>If Labour were to raise these points as its battle cry, not a
Tory would be left!</em> But the question of a socialist programme is
linked to the question of Party democracy. The clash between the NEC
and the cabinet is a small rumble compared to the explosions ahead if
present policies are continued. But already the <strong>Times</strong>, organ
of Big Business, has raised this as a &#8220;constitutional question&#8221;.
They have hinted at &#8220;dictatorship&#8221; over the &#8220;elected
Government&#8221; by the NEC.</p>
<p><em>But who is dictating to who? Hasn&#8217;t the Cabinet been under
pressure from the capitalists from the day it took office? The
unelected parasites in the boardrooms of the monopolies have
dictated, extorting &#0163;16,000 million!</em></p>
<p>The Labour Government was elected to serve the interests of
working people. Without rank and file working class support, not one
Labour MP would have a &#8216;cat in hell&#8217;s chance&#8217;.</p>
<p>That much must be clear from the fate of Taverne and Mayhew!</p>
<p>Without the sacrifice and struggle of millions over the years, not
one of the Labour MP&#8217;s would be where he or she is. They must be
accountable to the rank and file of the constituencies and the
conference, and subject to recall.</p>
<p>Too many have climbed to fame and fortune on the backs of the
working class. Shop stewards and many local councillors work for the
movement without reward. So it should be with MP&#8217;s. We need class
fighters willing to live on the wage of a skilled worker, not looking
for high salaries and perks.</p>
<p>This conference must go on record in demanding that the Government
sweep aside the Monopolies and get on with the job it was elected to
do! Carry out its programme!</p>
