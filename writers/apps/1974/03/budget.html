<p class="info">From <strong>Militant</strong>, No.&nbsp;199, 29 March 1974, pp.&nbsp;1&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;8.<br />
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<br />
<p class="fst"><em>There are some items in the budget which will relieve some of
the misery of the poorest. A raising of the tax threshold for the
lowest paid, a penny off the price of milk and the food subsidies of
£500 million along with an increase in pensions to £10 and £16 and
unemployment pay increases of $1.25 for a single person and £2 for a
married man will all be supported.</em></p>
<p>But the real question arising from the budget is, who will pay? If
those measures above were the only ones then it would mark a small
step forward, but they are not. It is largely a question of &#8220;Robbing
Peter to pay Paul&#8221;. Even more massive price increases are in the
pipeline as a result of Labour&#8217;s proposals.</p>
<p>Neither are they increases to tax the &#8220;well off&#8221; or even
&#8220;higher paid&#8221; workers alone, they will cut into the budgets of
every working class family in Britain, soaking up most, if not all of
the apparent benefit from other measures.</p>
<p>A brief list should make this point:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Electricity up 30% in August.</li>

<li>Rail fares up 12&#0189;% in June.</li>

<li>Post and telephone charges up soon.</li>

<li>Steel up 25% immediately.</li>

<li>Petrol up 5p a gallon next week.</li>

<li>Increased VAT on sweets etc.</li>

<li>5p on a packet of cigarettes.</li>

<li>p on a pint of beer.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">Every one of these increases will directly or indirectly raise the
cost of living even further for the working class. Apart from the
penny off milk, not one further reduction in price is proposed, the
food subsidies will only slow down (and not by very much) the rise in
food prices.</p>
<p>The small sums which some workers will save from a raising of the
tax threshold and reduction in the weekly insurance stamp will be
offset many times over by the other increases, along with inflation
in general.</p>
<p>Age Concern, a voluntary organisation assisting old people, have
pointed out that the new pension levels are not worth anything like
the original offer made by Labour after inflation since then. Since
the 1972 Conference when the figure was adopted the £10 has been
eroded by £1.69 which will be £2 in the summer.</p>
<p>Compared with the Tory offer of six monthly reviews and
compensation for inflation, the new figures are hardly better than
they otherwise might have got, by the time they actually get them.</p>
<p>An increase of corporation tax from 42% to 52% has been announced;
but most significant is that the promised wealth tax has been dropped
until &#8220;further notice&#8221;. This is a disgraceful retreat from
Labour&#8217;s Programme. All this will do is give the capitalists time
to readjust their affairs so that the tax, if introduced, will have
only a small effect, and at the same time enable them to mount a
massive campaign to press Labour to drop or drastically modify even
the mild proposals they have. At the same time we should recognise
that a wealth tax can have two effects: either it can be weakened by
amendments to make it ineffective; or if it really hits the rich,
then they will launch an &#8220;investment strike&#8221; thus sabotaging
Labour&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>The capitalist press may well have lauded the &#8220;fairness&#8221; of
the budget, how the rich have been stung and so on, but the truth is
just the opposite. On the surface the rich are to be taxed at a
higher rate, the massive concessions to the rich made by the Tories
have to some extent been reversed by the budget, but in reality the
benefactors will be the blossoming tax avoidance industry!</p>
<p>There are 1001 ways in which the rich and the high salaried bosses
can avoid paying tax. The tax tables published in all the newspapers
showing, for example, that the £100,000 a year will be taxed by
another £6,000 or £7,000 a year miss the point (deliberately of
course) that no capitalist in that position would be seen dead paying
tax at those rates. An army of accountants are at his disposal to
make sure his affairs are so arranged that he pays as little as
possible, and as long as the capitalist system exists and the wealth
is in the hands of these parasites, then attempts to tax them
severely will rebound.</p>
<p>Once again, beneath the gloss, it is the workers who are being
asked to pay for the bosses&#8217; crisis. All the praise for its
fairness from the press is designed to persuade the worker to accept
a &#8220;voluntary&#8221; incomes policy, to accept a cut in living standards
on the pretext that the misery is being shared around equally.</p>
<p>The games of the <strong>Daily Mirror</strong> have begun already. Its
headline for the day after the budget was &#8220;Now it is up to Jack
(Jones) and Hugh (Scanlon)&#8221;. The <strong>Mirror</strong> then said:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Now it is up to the Trade Unions ... will they honour
their side of the social contract? ... Now they must show they are
ready to make a voluntary incomes policy work, ready to throw their
weight into the fight against inflation&#8221;.</p>
<p class="fst">This argument must be fought tooth and nail. The rate of inflation
is now 18.8% a year. This means that a worker with a family take-home
pay of £30 a week would need by the end of the year, at this
inflation rate, an extra £5.64 just to stand still! And that is take
home pay. It means a gross increase of £7&#8211;8 a week will be demanded
just to keep the same standards as now.</p>
<p>But look at what Len Murray of the TUC had to say on BBC1 TV: &#8220;The
broad sweep of the budget has been very much what we are looking for.
We&#8217;ll respond in terms of wage claims, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps such an attitude from Murray is expected but even Jack
Jones of the TGWU who had opposed incomes policies and is seen to
stand on a left wing position said &#8220;workers will be making
sacrifices as a result of the budget. I believe they will do so willingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>In no sense is this a budget favourable to the working class. It
stands on the basis of capitalism. There are hardly any proposals to
even clip the finger-nails of the big monopolies who control the economy.</p>
<p>If Labour were ready to bring in a socialist budget it would be on
the basis of sweeping measures against the rich which could only be
implemented as part of a bold socialist programme. Such measures
would have to base themselves first and foremost on the
nationalisation of the 250 monopolies and the banks thus in real
terms making the rebuilding of society on socialist lines a possibility.</p>
