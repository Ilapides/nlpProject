<p class="fst"><em>At every one of the Conferences this weekend, the rank and file
of the Movement will be pressing hard for the new Labour Government
to carry out bold working class policies. They will be shouting loud
and clear to the leaders of the Movement &#8211; No retreat! Carry out
your Manifesto! The whole working class is looking to you for a lead.
DON&#8217;T FAIL US THIS TIME!</em></p>
<p>Up to a thousand delegates from Unions, Constituency Parties,
Trades Councils and Young Socialist branches will be at the
Conference in London called by the Clay Cross Labour Party. At the
same time, two other vital Trade Union Conferences and the Annual
Conference of Labour Women will be taking place (see other pages for reports).</p>
<p>Since the election, not a day has passed without the Tories baring
their teeth in rage. These hypocritical parasites, these true and
faithful representatives of the rich and powerful, have foamed at the
mouth with anger at the slightest hint of measures designed to
benefit the workers.</p>
<p>Just the suggestion of measures however mild, designed to
interfere with their sacred rights to make profits out of the labour
of the working class has unleashed a furious onslaught on the Trade
Unions and the Labour Party through their press.</p>
<p>They have organised a veritable conspiracy to prevent the Labour
Government from carrying through its programme. Let alone the
sweeping socialist measures which are needed to solve the problems of
the workers!</p>
<p>Look at the issue which has provoked the Clay Cross Conference &#8211;
the surcharging and ban from office of the eleven councillors. They
stood out against the Tory Housing Finance Act. For their tremendous
service to the movement the new Labour Government has refused to lift
these fines!</p>
<p>Under the pressure of the Tories screaming about &#8220;the Law&#8221;,
Tony Crosland has retreated and disgracefully allowed the threat of
enforcement of these surcharges to hang over the Clay Cross
councillors. Some 400 other Labour councillors who for a period
resisted the Housing Finance Act, could be affected.</p>
<p>But not only on Clay Cross has there been a retreat by the
leaders: Shrewsbury pickets; wage restraint while prices still soar;
frigates for the Chilean butchers; education cuts; wealth tax ...</p>
<p>The message of the rank and file will be to tell Labour to ignore
the pressures of the rich and STICK TO YOUR GUNS! In that way they
will get mass support. It is no accident that the Labour Party in
Clay Cross has had record votes in local elections. If their policy
of refusing to be bludgeoned by the Tories or their state officials
were to be taken up nationally then Labour could command overwhelming support.</p>
<p>Labour must push ahead with its full programme whatever the
resistance of the Tories. The alternative road which the leaders have
already started down will lead to disillusion and despair among the
ranks of Labour&#8217;s working class support. Those millions who were
thoroughly discontented with the Tories but did not support Labour at
the election will be confirmed in their political prejudices.</p>
<p>If the Labour leaders argue that they are holding back in order to
avoid a defeat they are wrong. They are preparing the way for defeat!</p>
<p>The fact that they are a minority Government must not be used as
an excuse. The way to turn that into a massive majority is by putting
up a fight! Labour must press ahead with its programme of social
reforms and challenge the Tories to bring them down on that.</p>
<p>Labour has promised great improvements in health, education,
pensions, housing and other social services. Let the Tories be seen
to be the ones opposing these. Male it clear that they oppose them
because THEIR capitalist system cannot afford them.</p>
<p>Why should Labour have to get the odium for carrying through Tory
measures? Anyway, what is the point of staying in office if you
cannot carry through measures in the workers&#8217; interests?</p>
<p><em>If they immediately push ahead with the programme the Tories
and Liberals might defeat them in Parliament. But then challenge them
to an election! On that basis, with a vigorous campaign, they could
win a landslide.</em></p>
<p>The Tories are &#8220;running scared&#8221;, in fear of an election
because of their lack of support. Labour should seize the opportunity
to hit them hard &#8211; kick them while they are down &#8211; we can be sure
that the Tories don&#8217;t obey any &#8220;gentleman&#8217;s rules&#8221;. For them
and so it must be for the Labour Movement, it is war to the end!</p>
<p>But even the programme of the Labour Party only tinkers with the
system, and even that is being put off because of the terrible crisis
of British capitalism. It is only through a socialist programme that
the resistance of the rich can be swept aside and the real problems
of the mass of the population really tackled.</p>
<p><em>Labour should call the Tories&#8217; bluff. Defeat them in an
election. Carry through an Enabling Act to give them powers to
immediately take over the commanding heights of the economy. Mobilise
the trade unions and the whole of the movement to defend this.</em></p>
