<p class="info">From <strong>Militant</strong>, No.&nbsp;402, 21 April 1978, p.&nbsp;2.<br />
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<br />
<p class="fst"><em>In his address to the Southern Region Labour Party Conference,
outlining the crisis of capitalism, and explaining the need for
socialist policies, Tony Benn said to loud cheers that &#8220;when the
young militants in my constituency speak on the ideas of socialism,
it is the old age pensioners that cheer the loudest!&#8221;. He added &#8220;if
we are returning to the old ideas of the movement, that is because
all the old problems are still with us.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This provided the answer to those one or two delegates who chose
to attack the <strong>Militant</strong> rather than participate in the debate
on the important questions that were before Conference.</p>
<p>Perhaps the liveliest debate was on the question of racialism and
fascism. Conference decided to sponsor the Anti-Nazi League, although
every delegate that spoke in favour pointed out that this must not be
at the expense of the labour movement putting forward its own
socialist programme, and that the ANL was not an alternative to the
labour movement organising its own campaign &#8211; the only force that
can defeat racialists and fascists.</p>
<p>This view was reinforced when conference went on to pass
unanimously an emergency resolution that called on the labour
movement in the Region to initiate vigorous anti-racialist campaigns.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Against Cuts</h4>
<p class="fst">Conference reaffirmed its opposition to cuts in public expenditure
and passed an emergency resolution supporting the occupation of the
nursery premises in Oxford. Criticising the executive for its failure
to pursue a campaign against the cuts as it was instructed to do by
last year&#8217;s conference. A composite was passed demanding that they
start a campaign now.</p>
<p>Conference also demanded a crash house-building programme in a
resolution moved by Wokingham CLP that called for the nationalisation
of the building and allied supply industries as well as the banks and
insurance companies.</p>
<p>The need for a campaign in support of Labour&#8217;s policy on the
nationalisation of the banks and insurance companies was spelt out in
a resolution from Reading South. This was carried despite the
opposition of the Regional Executive Committee.</p>
<p>The <strong>Militant</strong> meeting this year was well attended: after a
long session 43 turned up to take part in a debate around the
programme of the paper.</p>
<p>As one delegate attending one of our meetings for the first time
put it:<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minimum Wage</h4>
<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;You seem to be the only ones putting up a fight at
the moment. Your ideas are right. I work in the hotel industry and on
my wages I can&#8217;t make ends meet so demand for a &#0163;65 minimum wage
is essential. I was disillusioned by some of the things said at the
conference today, but attending this meeting and meeting people like
yourselves I shall go back refreshed and ready to continue the
struggle.&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="fst">&#0163;21 was collected for the Fighting Fund plus &#0163;15 from a raffle
organised by Bracknell supporters.</p>
