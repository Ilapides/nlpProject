<h1>Unite Behind Minority Report</h1>
<h3>(June 1978)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <b>Militant</b>, No.&nbsp;409, 9 June 1978.<br/>
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<br />
<p class="fst">As reported previously, the National Executive Committee of the
Labour Party voted by 15 to 4 to accept the Majority Report of the
Working Party on reselection of Members of Parliament.</p>
<p>According to information received to date, the NEC will circulate
all affiliated organisations with copies of the Majority&#8217;s
proposals, together with the Minority Report, for information.</p>
<p>We must now ensure that all affiliated organisations will be given
the opportunity to submit the rule changes suggested by the minority
as amendments to those of the majority at the next annual Party
Conference. This will require that affiliated organisations insist
that the NEC proposed amendments are printed in the preliminary
conference resolution booklet, circulated to affiliates, to allow for amendments.</p>
<p>The Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, at its recent Conference
in Oxford, refused to support the Minority report. We find that
inexplicable when the report was drafted and agreed with myself and
by two of the most ardent and hardworking members of the Campaign &#8211;
its Vice President, Jo Richardson MP, and EC member Bernard Kissen.</p>
<p>The Minority report was also fought for and supported on the NEC
by Joan Maynard MP, who was not only President of the Campaign, but
whose record of the struggle for democracy in the Labour Party is
second to none.</p>
<p><i>With the possibility of Constituency Labour Parties actually
losing, rather than gaining, powers of control over their MPs if the
Majority proposals are implemented [see </i><i><b>Militant</b></i><i>,
No.&nbsp;406], it is vital that the rank and file of the Labour
Party, including supporters of the CLPD, unite in support of the rule
changes proposed by the Minority Report.</i><br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Rank and file control over MPs</h4>
<p class="fst">In every Constituency Labour Party in the country demands have
been made by ordinary party members that there should be democratic
control over Labour MPs to endure their Parliamentary representatives
really do represent the policies decided upon by the party. The
difficulties faced by Constituency Parties in selecting new
candidates in place of sitting MPs (e.g. Newham North East, who had
to battle for months against Reg Prentice, who has since proved his
contempt for the Party by joining the Tories) resulted in over 60
Constituency Parties submitting resolutions to last year&#8217;s Party
Conference demanding an easier method of reselection.</p>
<p>The solution proposed in the Minority Report of the NEC Working
Party fully answers this need and entirely reflects the sentiments
expressed by Party Conference. It proposes that Clause XIV, section
7, of the Constituency Party rules should state:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><i>&#8220;If at any time this Party is represented in
Parliament by a member of the Parliamentary Labour Party, procedure
for the selection of a Prospective Parliamentary candidate shall, as
outlined in Section 3, be set in motion not earlier than eighteen
months and not later than thirty-six months after the sitting Member
was elected to Parliament.</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>&#8220;a] The sitting member shall automatically be placed
on the short list unless he or she wishes to retire.</i></p>
<p class="quote"><i>&#8220;b] The General Committee may at a specially
convened meeting intimate by resolution its desire that he or she
must retire at the next General Election. A Member of Parliament
against whom such action is taken shall have the right to appeal to
the NEC on the grounds, and only on the grounds, that the correct
procedure is carried out.&#8221;</i></p>
