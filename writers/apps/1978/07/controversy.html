<p class="fst">Victor Schonfield, like some of the other leaders of CLPD, is
surely seeking scapegoats for his own confusion and bungling.</p>
<p>The possibility that we may finish up with less democratic control
over MPs than we have at present has been brought about by their
obstinacy and refusal to admit mistakes, the greatest of which is to
under-estimate the opponents of extending the democratic control of
Constituency Labour Parties over MPs.</p>
<p>Victor Schonfield says I have an obsession with Paragraph (B). It
is true I have consistently fought for the retention of this clause
and will continue to do so. <em>However, it has never been at the
expense of my support for mandatory automatic reselection.</em> The
two complement one another.</p>
<p>Instead of making unsubstantiated allegations, Victor Schonfield
should ask the CLPD supporters on the Working Party how hard I
battled for mandatory reselection, which is the main theme of the
<em>Minority Report</em>. Incidentally, the issue of automatic
reselection was decided by the Majority before we went on to discuss
and vote on what was to replace Paragraph (B).</p>
<p>I warned CLPD some months before last year&#8217;s Annual Conference
that I believed they were giving a hostage to fortune by calling for
the removal of the right of a CLP to pass a vote of no confidence in
their sitting MP at any time of their choosing. This democratic
right, providing the proper procedure is carried out and used
properly, can be a powerful weapon in the hands of the Party rank and file.</p>
<p>This should be retained as an essential &#8220;reserve power&#8221;. It
became all the more necessary to fight for the retention of paragraph
(B) when it became clear that proposals of the working group majority
in effect amounted to no more than the right to move a vote of no
confidence in an MP once in the life of a parliament.</p>
<p>Victor Schonfield accuses me of conniving with the establishment.
The truth of the matter is that the &#8216;establishment&#8217;, the party
officials concerned and the right wing of the NEC, having no
intention of introducing mandatory reselection, gleefully
accommodated CLPD&#8217;s obsession with deleting Paragraph (B).
Sixty-eight resolutions called for its deletion they assured me. The
Party &#8216;establishment&#8217;, for all my supposed &#8216;conniving&#8217;, came
down firmly on the side of Victor Schonfield in this matter. &#8220;Ray
Apps prevents a clear vote on the principle,&#8221; CLPD repeat <em>ad
nauseam</em>. If that is the case, why did Conference vote against the
reference back when Victor Schonfield himself moved it (with my
support) so that the so-called clear principle could be put? Where
was the massive majority there?</p>
<p>If CLPD had listened to our advice, given long before they framed
their model resolution, those 68 resolutions would have been taken.
CLPD, not us, effectively disenfranchised 68 CLPs. They should
explain that to their supporters.</p>
<p>Who really speaks for CLPD? Victor Schonfield accuses me of
lending credibility to squalid manoeuvres by producing a <em>Minority Report</em>.</p>
<p>Here, Victor Schonfield glosses over another important point. Once
the resolution was referred back to the NEC with an assurance from
the Chairman that new rules would be formulated, it was obvious that
the NEC would have to appoint a sub-committee or working group to put
forward proposals.</p>
<p>When, as CLP delegate who moved the resolution debated, I was
invited to sit on the working party, should I have refused this
opportunity of defending the views of the rank and file in the body
that was actually given the task of drafting new rules? Should Jo
Richardson and Bernard Kissen also have refused to participate? Why
does Comrade Schonfield not say explicitly what his view is on this?</p>
<p>While on the working group I did not for a moment cease to argue
for our position, either in the meetings or in the Party generally.
Let me repeat: the <em>Minority Report</em> was written in conjunction
with Bernard Kissen and Jo Richardson MP, EC member and
vice-chairperson of CLPD. Does Victor Schonfield now disown them? We
fought together tooth and nail for mandatory reselection and, as the
infamous compromise evolved, came to see the vital importance of
retaining Paragraph (B).</p>
<p>The <em>Minority Report</em> is a measured and practical alternative
to the two-stage procedure of the majority. We called for a mandatory
reselection conference not earlier than eighteen months after an MP
was elected to Parliament for the very good reason that an MP, after
selection by a meeting in the CLP, should be given the chance to show
his or her true colours or earn their spurs, whichever the case may
be, and secondly to stop careerists holding a selection conference in
the euphoria of an election victory. Paragraph (B), if retained,
would still be there as a safeguard.</p>
<p>Victor Schonfield accuses me of misrepresentation by quoting his
letter (see <strong>Militant</strong>, No.&nbsp;411) in which he assured me that:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The meeting [of conference delegates supporting the
CLPD&#8217;s resolution] endorsed your shrewd tactics in exploiting the
situation to get the best possible assurances out of the NEC and
confirmed wholehearted support of the composite.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">How can you misrepresent someone by quoting him in full is beyond
me. Now he says he didn&#8217;t mean what he said in the letter. How do
you answer someone who argues like this?</p>
<p>I was handed that letter on the morning of the debate, and went to
the rostrum believing what it said: that I had the wholehearted
support of the Campaign for the composite I was moving. I didn&#8217;t
ask for their wholehearted support but was glad to have it.</p>
<p>Yes I am, to use Victor Schonfield&#8217;s words, experienced enough
to know that sometimes you have to support a resolution you don&#8217;t
agree with. But you should always make clear your support is critical.</p>
<p>If you want to win the trust and confidence of the movement, total
honesty is essential. Even at this late stage I appeal to CLPD
supporters to put aside personalities, and in the interests of the
struggle on for reselection to support the <em>Minority Report</em>.</p>
