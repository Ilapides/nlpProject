<p class="fst">At a 2,000-string Labour rally in Brighton last Saturday, the
Party&#8217;s activists and supporters gave their unmistakable answer to
Labour&#8217;s enemies who have been furiously attacking the party&#8217;s
&#8220;swing to the left.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Party leader, Michael Foot, was greeted with an ovation by the
packed audience in the Dome.</p>
<p>Most significant, however, was the overwhelming and enthusiastic
endorsement of Rod Fitch as Labour&#8217;s new parliamentary candidate
for the Brighton Kemptown constituency.</p>
<p>Rod [a well-known supporter of &#8216;Militant&#8217;] as well as the
local party itself, has come under a barrage of criticism from the
party since his recent selection.</p>
<p>The former Labour MP for Kemptown, Councillor Dennis Hobden, was
greeted with tremendous applause and cheering when he said:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;When I was an MP, Michael Foot often came to speak at
meetings for me, and when Rod Fitch is the MP, Michael Foot, I&#8217;m
sure, will speak on platforms with him also.&#8221;</p>
<p class="quote">&#8220;The press have rushed to publicise our two defectors.
But they have not mentioned the number who have joined the party in
the last three weeks alone.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Clive Walder, of the Labour Party Young Socialists and Regional LP
Executive, also referred to the press campaign against Militant
supporter Rod Fitch. To deafening applause, he said, &#8220;I for one am
glad that the Labour Party has selected Rod &#8211; it is returning to
its working class roots!&#8221;</p>
<p>Clive really caught the mood of the rally with a fighting speech
urging the need for socialist policies, for the implementation of
Clause IV, with the nationalisation of the big industrial and
financial monopolies under democratic workers&#8217; control and
management. Labour must campaign, Clive said, for a 35-hour week, an
Â£80 minimum wage, and a job for all. There should be a programme of
useful public works as part of a socialist plan of production.</p>
<p>The two local defectors to the &#8216;social democrats&#8217; referred to
by Councillor Dennis Hobden were Councillor Tom Forrester and his wife.</p>
<p>Another councillor attracted to the social democratic party which
Forrester is trying to establish locally is Councillor Ray Searle.
His only claim to fame in his time as a Labour councillor was that he
played &#8220;good cricket&#8221; with the Tories in the council team.</p>
<p>But are the social democratic defectors a serious threat to Labour
in Brighton? Last week&#8217;s Stanmer by-election shows that we have
little to worry about, provided Labour continues to campaign
energetically on socialist policies.</p>
<p>Tom Forrester, as self-appointed leader of the local Social
Democrats, issued a statement urging people to vote Liberal in the
election. The Liberals took up the defectors&#8217; attacks on the
alleged Trotskyist and Militant &#8216;domination&#8217; of the Labour Party.</p>
<p>In spite of these &#8220;red-scare&#8221; tactics, the Labour candidate
won with a majority of 7000 votes &#8211; more than all the other
candidates put together.</p>
<p>The most bizarre candidate was one Ian Cameron, known in Brighton
as a member of the fascist National Front, who appointed himself as
representative of the &#8220;New Centre Party for Social Democracy&#8221;. He
got a mere 38 votes. The official NF candidate got only 22 votes.</p>
<p>The Tories didn&#8217;t even put up a candidate.</p>
