<h1>Answering Tory press smears</h1>
<h3>(March 1981)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Militant</strong>, No.&nbsp;542, 6 March 1981, p.&nbsp;4.<br />
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<br />
<p class="fst"><em>In the weeks prior to the selection of Rod Fitch as prospective
parliamentary candidate for Brighton Kemptown, the local paper the
<strong>Evening Argus</strong>, conducted a vitriolic campaign against
&#8216;Militant&#8217; supporters and Rod in particular.</em></p>
<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />

<p class="fst">The candidate they wanted selected was meanwhile given favourable coverage.</p>
<p>The <strong>Argus</strong> claimed:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Militants want the selecting made while they are
dominant. They may lose strength on the party&#8217;s policy making body
the GMC at the next AGM.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">This ignores the fact that the Party had been waiting for NEC
permission to proceed for eighteen months as we were anxious to have
a candidate in the field as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As for our losing support, at the AGM after the selection of Rod
our support in Kemptown has grown rapidly as the <strong>Argus</strong> was
forced to concede with the headline &#8220;Militants Tighten Grip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cllr. Tom Forrester who has defected to form a new centre party
stated in the same article &#8220;this confirms my worst fears.&#8221;</p>
<p>We have standing as a New Centre Party candidate in a local
bye-election, a certain Mr. Cameron, who a few months ago stood as a
National Front candidate in St Peters ward and received 15 votes!</p>
<p>Rod&#8217;s selection has engendered tremendous enthusiasm. The local
labour movement has rallied round him.</p>
<p>Countless party members have sent in messages of support, the
Council Labour Group, the Trades Union Council, who have appointed
their past president to liaise with Kemptown Labour Party to mobilise
active union support.</p>
<p>Party membership is growing by leaps and bounds, and more trade
union branches are affiliating. We have our own local Labour paper
distributed to 15,000 households answering media distortions.</p>
<p>Our roots are deep in Brighton&#8217;s working people. Our support
continues to grow because of our ideas and record of service to the
labour movement over two decades.</p>
<p>Quinten Barry our candidate in the last election sums up how were
are viewed as real Labour loyalists, when in a letter to me he states
&#8220;in a long gruelling campaign I was encouraged every morning by
your enthusiasm and tireless work.&#8221;</p>
<p>True, Andrew Bowden the Tory has an 8,000 majority, but we are
confident that with socialist policies and necessary organisation we
can beat off the social democrats, smash that majority and return a
Labour MP for Brighton Kemptown, as part of a massive majority for
Labour at the general election.</p>
