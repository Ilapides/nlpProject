<p class="fst"><em>Denis Healey used a fringe meeting at Labour&#8217;s Southern
Regional Annual Conference recently to fire another salvo at the
left, and at <strong>Militant</strong> in particular.</em></p>
<p>Healey referred to the Social Democrats as &#8220;my friends&#8221;, whose
policies he agreed with, his only criticism being that they had left
the party.</p>
<p>Despite a free buffet lunch however, only 47 turned up to hear
Healey&#8217;s views.</p>
<p>There was a &#8220;widespread&#8221; view in the party, Healey asserted,
that we should not spend six months on the election of deputy leader.
In other words, Tony Benn should not be standing.</p>
<p>Yet even while Healey was speaking, this idea was crushingly
refuted. Three hundred people, including most of the conference
delegates, were giving a standing ovation to Tony Benn at a meeting
organised by Kemptown Labour Party.</p>
<p>From the platform, Rod Fitch, prospective parliamentary candidate
for Kemptown, and Alan Huyton of the LPYS national committee, both
gave their support to his candidature.</p>
<p>Tony Benn made it clear that the deputy-leadership contest was not
about personalities, but the need for socialist policies and a
collective leadership to carry them through.</p>
<p>Rod Fitch was loudly applauded when he said that the Party needed
a leadership democratically answerable to the rank and file.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Whatever the leadership may be,&#8221; said Rod, &#8220;if
they try to work within the framework of capitalism, then they will
fail &#8211; and we will face defeat and a government even more
reactionary than Thatcher&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">On the previous evening, <strong>Militant</strong> held a successful public
meeting. There was certainly more support than for Denis Healey&#8217;s
nosh-up, and a collection raised &#0163;89 in support of Marxist ideas.</p>
