<p class="info">From <b>Militant</b>, No.&nbsp;472, 28 September 1979, pp.&nbsp;1&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;16.<br/>
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<br />
<p class="fst">In a desperate attempt to halt the helter-skelter slide of British
capitalism, the Tories have unleashed a torrent of ruthless
anti-working class measures.</p>
<p>For big business, a crisis situation demands crisis measures &#8211;
and to hell with the consequences for working people.</p>
<p>In Thatcher and Co. the bankers and boardroom millionaires have
found a representative more than willing to carry out their brutal demands.</p>
<p>Since they came to power in May, one section of working people
after another have been hit or threatened with the sharp cutting axe
of the Tories in the hospitals, schools and other public services, or
by hard-faced employers whose determination to keep wages down has
been resolved by the Thatcher government at Westminster.</p>
<p>Now whole steel towns are to be closed down. Nationalised
industries, such as British Rail, are faced with massive redundancies
as part of the Tory&#8217;s de-nationalisation threat. Public and civil
services, and the jobs that go with them, are to be cut.</p>
<p>Remember that Tory election poster which above a long line of
actors posing as a dole queue, cried out: &#8216;Labour isn&#8217;t working&#8217;?</p>
<p>Rising unemployment has put paid to any hypocritical Tory promise
of reducing the number of unemployed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, there was a ring of truth about Labour
&#8216;not working&#8217;. Despite all the well-meant promises of reform by
the 1974 Labour government, the catastrophic decline of diseased
British capitalism shattered any illusions about them being implemented.</p>
<p>That is why this year&#8217;s Labour Party conference must give a bold
and firm socialist alternative to answer the anarchy of the profit system.</p>
<p>In the coming battles workers will more and more be looking to
Labour for a lead. Already, in many local elections &#8211; only five
months after the Tory victory &#8211; Labour councillors are being
returned with decisive majorities.</p>
<p>In one area of Luton, for example, in a bye-election in a safe
Tory seat, a Labour councillor was returned and the Tories were
reduced to third place!</p>
<p>But if Labour campaigns on the record of the last government, it
will not succeed! Wage restraint, public expenditure cuts, and
anti-working class policies will never be rallying calls for the workers.</p>
<p>Only bold socialist policies, with a clear commitment to a minimum
wage, a 35-hour week, and end to unemployment, and a comprehensive
education and welfare system must be the mainstay of any Labour campaign.</p>
<p>Then Labour would win mass support for an energetic fight against
the Tory government and for the sweeping return of a Labour government.</p>
<p>To ensure that socialist policies are carried out by the next
Labour government it is essential that the calls for party democracy
are carried through. For the labour movement to put their trust in
the Labour Party, it must be sure there is rank and file control over
their representatives.</p>
<p>The Labour Party must use all its resources to expose waste and
anarchy of capitalism, and to map out a socialist alternative.</p>
