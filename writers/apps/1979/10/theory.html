<p class="fst">Dear Comrades,</p>
<p class="fst">Dave Hughes&#8217; letter (issue 471) makes an important contribution
to the debate on the future of the labour movement. He is right to
point out that the labour movement must be seen to lead the fight on
behalf of all the oppressed minorities.</p>
<p>We must be the most resolute fighters in their defence, just as we
must be in the forefront of the fight back against the Tories, and
this means mass action not speeches in Parliament or Council
Chambers. Our discussion would be abstract and sterile indeed, if
limited to a debate on a manifesto for the next Labour government.</p>
<p>We would deserve to be dubbed armchair philosophers if we retired
to the drawing room to debate the future, while our class are engaged
in a desperate struggle to defend jobs, living standards, social
services and trade union rights.</p>
<p>Just a cursory glance through any issue of <strong>Militant</strong> will
show that our supporters are involved in all, and to the forefront of
many of these struggles.</p>
<p>However it would be an error in the opposite direction to adopt
the &#8216;struggle is all&#8217; approach of some of the sects, who throw
themselves into one campaign after another, making no attempt to
generalise these struggles and link them to the need to change
society. They just add as an afterthought the need for socialism.</p>
<p>I do not, of course, imply in anyway that this is the position of
Dave his letter leads inescapably to the need for a transitional
programme as put forward by <strong>Militant</strong>.</p>
<p>Theory and practice are not mutually exclusive but are
indivisible. Marxist theory is not for study by learned professors.
Theory is the distilled experience of the class struggle and a guide
to action by the working class.</p>
