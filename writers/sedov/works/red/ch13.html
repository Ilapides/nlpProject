<h4>On the Moscow Trials</h4>

<br />
 

<h1>COPENHAGEN</h1>

<br />
 <hr class="base" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p class="fst">Copenhagen plays a major role at the trial. It&#8217;s there
that Trotsky&#8217;s &#8220;meetings&#8221; with the terrorists are supposed to have
taken place, from there supposedly came Trotsky&#8217;s &#8220;instructions&#8221; for
terror. The Trotskyists would have turned the peaceful capital of
Denmark, if one believes the court transcripts, into a sort of foreign
&#8220;terrorist center.&#8221; This question therefore requires a detailed
examination.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1932, the Danish Social-Democratic Student
Organization invited Comrade Trotsky to give a lecture in Copenhagen on
the Russian Revolution. Judging it difficult, it seems, to refuse the
students, the Danish government gave L. Trotsky a visa for Denmark, <em>good
for eight days</em>. Having left Istanbul on November 14, 1932, L.
Trotsky (after a circuitous journey through France) arrived in Denmark
on November 23. Trotsky stayed in Copenhagen <em>for eight days;</em>
he left this city on the morning of December 2, in order to return to
Istanbul, once again by way of France.</p>
<p>The formal charges and the verdict say that Trotsky carried out
terrorist activities for about five years (from 1931 to 1936). During
these five years Trotsky spent a <em>total of eight days</em> in
Copenhagen. But, by some strange coincidence all the &#8220;terrorists&#8221; who
supposedly met with Trotsky (Holtzman, Berman-Yurin, Fritz David) chose
&#8212; completely independently of each other!&#8212;precisely Copenhagen as the
location for their meeting with Trotsky, during the very same week,
from November 23 to December 2, 1932. No other meeting in any other
city was mentioned during the trial.</p>
<p>Only one week of &#8220;terrorist&#8221; activity during five years! This fact
alone has to evoke disbelief. The explanation is simple. Copenhagen was
chosen by the GPU investigators for reasons of personal convenience.
The city is close to Berlin, it&#8217;s easy to go there, and above all, the
exact dates and circumstances of Trotsky&#8217;s stay in Copenhagen were in
all the papers. That gave the GPU investigators the necessary
&#8220;material.&#8221; Meetings in Istanbul or in the secluded villages of France,
where Trotsky lived during those years, were an exercise which was
really too dangerous for the GPU. The lack of &#8220;material&#8221; added to the
risk of failure.</p>
<p>Having chosen Copenhagen, the GPU sent not only the &#8220;terrorists&#8221;
Holtzman, Berman-Yurin, and Fritz David, but also Sedov. Here is
Holtzman&#8217;s account of his trip to Copenhagen:</p>
<p><br>

Sedov told me ... that it would be good if you came with me to
Copenhagen [to see Trotsky] ... I agreed, but I told him that it would
be impossible to travel together out of considerations of secrecy. I
arranged with Sedov that I would arrive in Copenhagen in two or three
days; that I would stop at the Hotel Bristol and that we would meet
there. From the station I went straight to the hotel where I met Sedov
in the foyer. <a id="a54" href="#n54" name="a54" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[54]</span></a></p>
<p><br>
We are greatly won over by this account with all its factual evidence
which so rarely appears at this trial. In particular, it even names the
Hotel Bristol where Holtzman and Sedov supposedly met in the foyer. The
only trouble is that <em>there is no Hotel Bristol in Copenhagen</em>.
Such a hotel did exist but it was closed in 1917 and the building
itself was destroyed. <a id="a55" href="#n55" name="a55" target="_blank" ><span
class="note">[55]</span></a></p>
<p>Perhaps Holtzman or one of his investigators had gone to Copenhagen
before the Revolution and had stayed at the Hotel Bristol. Perhaps the
investigators simply decided that there is no major city in Europe
without a Hotel Bristol. Everything is possible ... But the incompetent
and lazy investigators would have done better to take the trouble to
first make the necessary inquiry. Now there&#8217;s some &#8220;sabotage&#8221; for you!
And after this. what else remains of the testimony, so rich in detail,
given by Holtzman, the most important witness for the prosecution?
Doesn&#8217;t this fact alone shed a bright light on the whole trial?</p>
<h4>Sedov&#8217;s Trip to Copenhagen</h4>
<p class="fst">But that&#8217;s not all. As we have seen, they forced
Holtzman to say that he didn&#8217;t go to Copenhagen alone,&#8212;that by
agreement with him, Sedov also went to Copenhagen. In describing the
conditions of his conversation with Trotsky, Holtzman gives us
interesting new details: &#8220;very frequently Trotsky&#8217;s son Sedov would
enter the room and then leave it.&#8221; A new act of sabotage! <em>Never in
his life was Sedov in Copenhagen</em>. This sounds unbelievable, but
nevertheless it&#8217;s true. In order for Sedov to be able to travel to
Copenhagen from Berlin, his home at that time, he had to obtain a visa
from the Berlin Police Headquarters to leave and re-enter Germany (a
so-called &#8220;Sichtvermerk&#8221;). The obtaining of such a visa ordinarily
brings with it great difficulties for a <em>Heimatloser</em>

(stateless person).</p>
<p>When it became clear that L.D. Trotsky would go to Copenhagen, Sedov
immediately began efforts&#8212;through his lawyer, the late Oscar Cohn &#8212;
to obtain permission to leave and return to Germany, hoping after this,
to obtain a visa to Denmark without any difficulty. Since it was
originally supposed that Trotsky&#8217;s visa to Denmark would be extended a
few weeks for medical treatment, the delay at the Berlin Police
Headquarters at first did not worry Sedov or his parents. It was quite
unexpected when, after the eight days had gone by, the Danish
government in a very sharp manner ordered Trotsky to leave Danish soil.
By now Sedov had no possibility of meeting with his parents in
Copenhagen. A last attempt was made to see each other, even though it
would only be for the short time which Trotsky had to spend in France
on his way from Copenhagen to Istanbul (Dunkirk&#8212;Marseilles via
Paris). N.I. Trotsky sent a detailed telegram to Edouard Herriot, the
French prime minister at that time, asking him to give her son, Sedov,
permission to travel in France for a few days in order to meet with
him&middot;after being separated for several years. This telegram can
undoubtedly be found in the archives of the French Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. Sedov, on his part, with the help of Oscar Cohn, managed
finally to obtain permission from the Berlin Police Headquarters for
the return trip to Germany, without which he could not have received a
French visa. On December 3 <a id="a56" href="#n56" name="a56" target="_blank" ><span
class="note">[56]</span></a> , 1932, Sedov received the necessary
permission from the German Police and on the same day the French
consulate in Berlin received a telegram with instructions to give Sedov
a French visa for five days. On the morning of December 4, Sedov left
for Paris and arrived in the evening; at 10 AM on December 6 he met
with Trotsky in Paris, at the Gare du Nord, in a railroad car. His
father was travelling from Dunkirk to Marseilles without stopping in
Paris.</p>
<p>Everything said above on be verified by certain documents: 1) <em>Sedov&#8217;s
passport</em> with the corresponding visas and stamps for going both
ways across the Franco-German border; 2) <em>Natalia Trotsky&#8217;s
telegram to Herriot</em>, asking him to give a visa to her son, whom
she was unable to see in Copenhagen; 3) <em>a certificate from the
Danish authorities</em> stating that Sedov never asked for and never
received a Danish visa. But, they can say,&#8212;perhaps Sedov travelled to
Denmark &#8220;illegally&#8221;? Let us assume so. But why then, we must ask, was
Sedov&#8212;after meeting with his parents illegally in Copenhagen,
travelling a few days later to another meeting with them in France, a
trip which was accompanied by such difficulties and trouble (a telegram
to Herriot, etc.)?</p>

<p>But we have at our disposal <em>irrefutable</em> proof that while
Trotsky was staying in Copenhagen, Sedov remained in Berlin without
interruption:</p>
<p class="fst">1. Over the course of these eight days Trotsky or his
wife talked with Sedov on the phone every day, sometimes twice a day,
by calling Sedov&#8217;s Berlin apartment from Copenhagen. This can&#8212;and
will be established by the central telephone office in Copenhagen.</p>
<p class="fst">2. Since Trotsky&#8217;s journey from Istanbul to Copenhagen
brought on the burning hatred of world reaction, a number of Trotsky&#8217;s
friends and co-thinkers set out hurriedly for Copenhagen. There were
more than 20 people. All of them will swear under oath that L. Sedov
was never in Copenhagen. Let us allow ourselves to take up one of these
statements. Its author is E. Bauer, whom we have already quoted, now in
the leadership of the SAP (Socialist Workers Party of Germany),
formerly a member of the German Left Opposition. In September 1934,
following serious political disagreements, E. Bauer broke with the
organization of the Bolshevik-Leninists; this split was accompanied by
very sharp polemics. Since then, E. Bauer has had no connection, either
political or personal, with the membership of the Trotskyist
organization. &#8220;This is why&#8221; as he writes in his deposition, &#8220;there can
be no question in my case of any partiality toward the Trotskyists.&#8221;
Then he writes: &#8220;From the first day of Trotsky&#8217; s stay in Copenhagen, I
spoke daily with Sedov in Berlin either directly or by telephone, since
I was preparing to travel to Copenhagen. On the evening of December 1,
1932, I left for Copenhagen. Sedov accompanied me to the station and
... remained in Berlin. On the morning of December 2, we [Bauer and
another person] arrived in Copenhagen ... and two hours later, between
10 and 11 o&#8217;clock in the morning, I was leaving Copenhagen by car with
Trotsky and his wife; Sedov was not with us, since his trip had been
impossible for technical reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>We have at our disposal ten similar depositions and we will have
still more. <em>We are ready to submit all this material immediately
to a responsible commission or a tribunal which would undertake an
investigation of this case</em>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how things stand with the testimony of the chief witness
Holtzman who was, in spite of everything, an old Bolshevik. After this,
is it necessary to dwell on the statements of scoundrels and Stalinist
agents such as Berman-Yurin and Fritz David? Neither Trotsky nor Sedov
&#8212; we repeat once more&#8212;had ever laid eyes on these people, whether in
Copenhagen or elsewhere; they learned of their existence for the first
time through the reports from the Moscow trial.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="40%">
<br>

<p class="fst">We have already noted above that at the time of
Trotsky&#8217;s stay in Copenhagen, several dozen friends and comrades were
also there. Fearing possible incidents, these comrades organized a very
serious guard around Trotsky. It was impossible to enter L. Trotsky&#8217;s
study without first passing through another room, where there were
always four or five comrades. Access to the small villa occupied by
Trotsky in Copenhagen was only allowed to a few close friends. <a
id="a57" href="#n57" name="a57" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[57]</span></a>
Neither Berman-Yurin, nor Fritz David, nor anyone else could have
reached Trotsky unless comrades on guard in the front room knew about
it.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="40%">
<br>
<p class="fst">By the preliminary, yet absolutely precise,
investigations carried out by the comrades who were in Copenhagen, it
has been possible to establish that Trotsky received only one
Russian-speaking person in Copenhagen. This is a certain Abraham Senin
(Sobolevich), who was then a Lithuanian citizen and a member of the
Berlin organization of the Opposition. He came to see Cde. Trotsky on
the last day of his stay in Copenhagen (at the same time as E. Bauer)
and spoke no more than one hour with Trotsky, under conditions of
extreme haste before the sudden departure. Senin&#8217;s trip to Copenhagen
was made at the insistence of some of Trotsky&#8217;s Berlin friends; they
had wanted to make a last effort to save Senin from capitulation to the
Stalinists, to whom he was drawing nearer and nearer. The attempt was
not crowned with success; a few weeks later, Senin, with three or four
friends, went over to the Stalinists. This event was reported in both
the Stalinist and Oppositionist press. By the very character of L.D.
Trotsky&#8217;s meeting with the semi-capitulator Senin, it is quite obvious
that Trotsky could not have maintained any confidence in Senin and
could no longer look upon him as a cothinker.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="40%">
<br>
<p class="fst">In conclusion, we must once more turn our attention
toward part of the testimony given by Olberg which deals with
Copenhagen. &#8220;It was my intention&#8221; says Olberg &#8220;to go to Copenhagen with
Sedov to see Trotsky. Our trip did not succeed and it was Sedov&#8217;s wife,
Suzanne, who left for Copenhagen. Upon her return, she brought a letter
<a id="a58" href="#n58" name="a58" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[58]</span></a>
from Trotsky addressed to Sedov, in which Trotsky agreed to my trip to
the USSR, etc.&#8221; This must be noted above all: in affirming that his
trip to Copenhagen with Sedov did not take place. Olberg contradicts
Holtzman. Because if one were to admit that Sedov went to Copenhagen
without Olberg, why then would Trotsky have given a letter for Sedov to
his companion, as Olberg contends?</p>
<p><br>

No one, of course, has to know the name of Sedov&#8217;s wife, but Olberg,
who claims to be on intimate terms with Sedov (&#8220;we [Sedov and I] met
almost weekly, and sometimes we met twice a week in a cafe ... or I
visited him at his apartment,&#8221; testifies Olberg), should have known
that <em>Sedov&#8217;s wife is not named Suzanne</em>. Furthermore, Olberg,
as we have just seen, affirms that this same Suzanne &#8220;upon her return
[from Copenhagen to Berlin] brought a letter from Trotsky.&#8221; Sedov&#8217;s
wife really was in Copenhagen, <a id="a59" href="#n59" name="a59" target="_blank" ><span
class="note">[59]</span></a> but she left there <em>not for Berlin,
but directly for Paris</em>, where she remained for a rather long time.
This fact can be established with absolute precision on the basis of
the passport belonging to Sedov&#8217;s wife. It is completely obvious that
Trotsky could not give Sedov&#8217;s wife, who was leaving <em>for Paris</em>,
a letter for Sedov who was <em>in Berli<span
style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">n</span></em><span
style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">, B</span>ut, one might
object once again, perhaps Sedov&#8217;s wife nevertheless went &#8220;illegally&#8221;
to Berlin. &#8220;Illegal trips&#8221; are not romanticism, they are a sad
necessity for those who do not have papers. But why would a person who
has a good legal passport for travelling in every country, the majority
of which do not even require her to have a visa, travel illegally? This
is simply not serious!</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="40%">
<br>

<p class="fst">There we have the &#8220;foreign terrorist center&#8221; of
Copenhagen, the only European city mentioned in the trial. The baseness
of it aside, what poverty of invention! What a pitiful and hopeless
failure!</p>
<hr class="base" noshade="noshade" size="1">

<p class="note"><a id="n54" href="#a54" name="n54" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[54]</span></a>
It must be noted that Holtzman was a Soviet citizen and as such,
getting a visa for any country, including Demark, was fraught with
nearly insurmountable difficulties, if the request was not backed by
the Soviet Embassy, and it goes without saying that in this case there
can be no talk of the embassy&#8217;s support. Thus Holtzman could only go to
Copenhagen illegally. It is strange that the court was not interested
in these circumstances and did not explain what papers Holtzman used to
go to Denmark, where he got these papers, etc. (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n55" href="#a55" name="n55" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[55]</span></a>
For further details, see the <strong>Sozial Demokraten</strong> of
Copenhagen on September 1, 1936; also <strong>Baedeker</strong>.</p>

<p class="note">The work of falsification went full speed ahead even
after the trial. In the English language edition of the court
transcripts, which appeared somewhat later than the others, the Hotel
Bristol is not even mentioned! (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n56" href="#a56" name="n56" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[56]</span></a>
Trotsky left Copenhagen, as we already said, on December 2. (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n57" href="#a57" name="n57" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[57]</span></a>
We take this opportunity to correct an imprecision which slipped into
the Russian edition of this work. It was said in this passage that some
journalists had visited Trotsky in this villa. This was incorrect and
was immediately rectified by comrades present in Copenhagen. In
reality, no journalist any more than anyone else, outside of the
immediate friends who stood guard, was able to enter the villa. (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n58" href="#a58" name="n58" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[58]</span></a>

The contents of the &#8220;letter&#8221; by Trotsky about Olberg, with whom the
reader is already sufficiently familiar are very amusing. In order to
puff himself up, it seems, Olberg declares that in this letter Trotsky
was in &#8220;full agreement&#8221; with Olberg&#8217;s candidacy for the trip to the
USSR. Trotsky considered Olberg &#8220;an absolutely (!!) appropriate (??)
man in whom one could have complete confidence (!!)&#8221; The whole letter
is nothing but a dithyramb to Olberg! (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n59" href="#a59" name="n59" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[59]</span></a>
The GPU could have obtained information about this in its own manner,
for example, by way of the above-mentioned Senin, who later was to play
a somewhat suspicious role. (<em>L.S.</em>) See also note 73.</p>
