<h4>On the Moscow Trials</h4>

<br />
 

<h1>DID A &#8220;UNIFIED CENTER&#8221; EXIST?</h1>

<br />
 
<hr class="base" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p class="fst">The axis of the trial and at the same time the basis of
the indictment, was the so-called <em>&#8220;Unified Center.&#8221;</em> This
center not only made the decision to take the road of terror, but
organized and directed the attacks. The question of the &#8220;Center&#8221; has,
consequently, decisive importance for the analysis of the trial. We are
forced to examine it in greater detail.</p>
<p>We have already tried to show the arbitrary way in which Stalin
included four Zinovievists in the trial, designating them as members of
the Center. But no matter what the cost, he had to get at Trotsky,
without whom the whole trial would have been worthless. The collapse of
the consul affair forced him to look for other ways. Stalin understood
that the Zinovievists, who had broken with the Left Opposition in
January 1928, by capitulating to the bureaucratic apparatus, had not
had any ties with the Left Opposition since then and could hardly be of
use to him in attaining his goal. He needed to &#8220;unite&#8221; them, those who
had earlier taken upon themselves the political responsibility for
Kirov&#8217;s assassination&#8212;with the Trotskyists. It was precisely this
&#8220;unification&#8221; that the &#8220;Unified Center&#8221; was to serve. After the
unsuccessful attempts to indict the true Trotskyists,&#8212;Stalin&#8217;s
blackmailing could only have run up against a sharp refusal on their
part&#8212;Stalin stopped at former Left Oppositionists,&#8212;Smirnov,
Mrachkovsky and Ter-Vaganian. These men had openly broken with the Left
Opposition in 1929, that is, seven years ago! And in the absence of any
authentic Trotskyists (among the defendants, let us once again recall,
there was not one true Trotskyist), Stalin was forced to content
himself with pseudo-Trotskyists, all the more so since one of them,
I.N. Smirnov, had by chance met with Trotsky&#8217;s son in Berlin. This at
least gave him the formal pretext of speaking of a &#8220;connection&#8221; abroad.</p>
<p>Thus the idea of creating the &#8220;Unified Center&#8221; was born in Stalin&#8217;s
police mind. The rest was a case of police technique.</p>
<h4>The Composition of the Center</h4>
<p class="fst">The indictment and the verdict give the Unified Center
the following composition: Zinoviev, Kamenev, Evdokimov, Bakaev,&#8212;from
the Zinovievists, and Smirnov, Ter-Vaganian, Mrachkovsky&#8212;from the
Trotskyists.</p>

<p>But even on the question of the composition of the center, the
defendants contradict each other. Besides, we are not talking about a
large committee, the composition of which would be constantly changing,
where it would be difficult to remember everybody, but essentially
about a narrow, strictly conspiratorial collegium, involved in
terrorist activity. The composition of such a conspiratorial center
ought, in any case, to have been exactly defined. This is, in fact,
what the indictment tries to do as it enumerates the seven members
cited above. The defendant Reingold, one of the principal witnesses of
the prosecution, gives a different composition of the center. &#8220;I was,&#8221;
he says, &#8220;in an organizational and also personal relationship with a
series of members of the Trotskyist-Zinovievist center: Zinoviev,
Kamenev, <em>Sokolnikov</em>, and others.&#8221; And further on Reingold
repeats: &#8220;the members of the Trotskyist-Zinovievist center were
Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bakaev, Evdokimov, Smirnov, Mrachkovsky,
Ter-Vaganian, and <em>Sokolnikov</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fact that Sokolnikov was a member of the center is also
confirmed by Kamenev, who specifies, in response to a question by the
prosecutor, that Sokolnikov was even a &#8220;member of the center whose
participation was strictly secret,&#8221; in order that he might, in case of
disaster, continue the terrorist activity. One, therefore, wonders why
the prosecutor did not immediately summon Sokolnikov before the court.
It is very simple: to summon Sokolnikov at that very moment would have
meant to destroy the entirely false, and therefore &#8220;fragile&#8221; edifice of
the trial.</p>
<p>Sokolnikov would first have to be prepared in the torture chambers
of the GPU, and that, even if successful, takes time. The fact that
Reingold mentioned Sokolnikov, on Stalin&#8217;s orders, was necessary in
order to make it easier to execute him without even a trial.</p>
<p>While confirming the testimony about Sokolnikov, Kamenev, for his
part, gives a new version of the center (of the &#8220;plot,&#8221; as he calls it)
which &#8220;was composed of the following people: from the Zinovievists,
myself (Kamenev), Zinoviev, Evdokimov, Bakaev, and Kuklin,&#8221; Besides
Sokolnikov, <em>Kuklin</em> also is apparently a member of the center.
As in Sokolnikov&#8217;s case, the prosecutor doesn&#8217;t consider it necessary
to bring Kuklin to trial. Meanwhile, Kuklin, one of the oldest
worker-Bolsheviks and leading Zinovievists, who was sentenced in
January 1935 to 10 years in prison, is mentioned many times over during
the trial as one of the leaders of the terrorist activity!</p>
<p>According to Smirnov&#8217;s testimony, the <em>Lominadze group</em> had
also joined the bloc (Smirnov says nothing about the Center and later,
as we will see, he even denies its existence). Let us note that no
member of this group was brought to trial. Although he did &#8220;confirm
Smirnov&#8217;s testimony,&#8221; Ter-Vaganian does not mention the Lominadze group
in his account. Mrachkovsky, on the contrary, not only mentions the
Lominadze-Shatskin group as members of the bloc, but says in addition
that <em>Lominadze</em> personally was a member of the center. Bakaev
names not only Kuklin, but also <em>Sharov</em>, another old
Bolshevik-Zinovievist, sentenced during the first trial in 1935. <em>Karev</em>

is repeatedly mentioned as a leading participant at a terrorist
conference (of the Center?) But he also is not on the defendants&#8217;
bench, since his case has, for some reason, been &#8220;set aside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Better still, Kamenev testifies that, in case of discovery, besides
Sokolnikov, <em>Serebriakov and Radek</em> were also designated as
substitutes, &#8220;who,&#8221; according to Kamenev, &#8220;could perform the role with
success.&#8221; Let us recall that Serebriakov split from the Opposition in
1928, and Radek left in 1928, and how he left! Since 1929 Radek has
appeared several times in the press as one of the most hateful and
vicious adversaries of Trotskyism. But even this didn&#8217;t help him!</p>
<p>During the trial, <em>Safonova</em> is also brought from prison to
serve as a &#8220;witness,&#8221; and her interrogation produces a particularly
painful and loathesome impression. Hoping to save herself (and in
reality Stalin is at best saving her for a new trial, in order to shoot
her afterwards, as he shot all the Berman-Yurins), Safonova denounces
I.N. Smirnov in a veritable frenzy. And this Safonova, according to the
records of the trial, &#8220;was herself a member of the Trotskyist center
... and took an active part in the work of the center.&#8221; Why then is she
summoned only as a witness?</p>
<p>The center also supposedly conducted negotiations about &#8220;joint
activity&#8221; (i.e., about terror) with <em>Shatskin, Sten (&#8220;leftists&#8221;),
Rykov, Bukharin, Tomsky, (&#8220;rightists&#8221;), Shliapnikov and Medvedev
(former &#8220;Workers Opposition&#8221;)</em>. Of course, not one of them is
summoned before the court, even as a witness.</p>
<p>Falsification is not such an easy thing. No matter how deeply you
submerge them, lies and contradictions stubbornly reappear at the
surface. These contradictions in the composition of the center are
undoubtedly explained by the fact that during the investigation, the
composition was changed more than once.</p>

<p>Some of the &#8220;candidates&#8221; who had been designated in the early stages
couldn&#8217;t be broken,&#8212;it was necessary therefore to rebuild along the
way, including new victims in the &#8220;center,&#8221; and once again bringing the
dates and the testimony into agreement.</p>
<p>In addition, the whole case was prepared with such haste that all
the defendants could not learn their roles ...</p>
