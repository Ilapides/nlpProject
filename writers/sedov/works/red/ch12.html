<h1>THE ATTEMPTS WHICH DID NOT TAKE PLACE</h1>

<br />
 
<hr class="base" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p class="fst">Besides general conversations about terror, the
transmission of &#8220;instructions&#8221;, all sorts of &#8220;terrorist&#8221; conceptions,
etc., a few concrete attacks are nevertheless mentioned. Let us take
them one by one.<br>
</p>
<h4>1.The Berman-Yurin&#8212;Fritz David Team<br>
The Attack on Stalin</h4>
<br>
<p class="fst">Having arrived in Moscow in March 1933, <a id="a49"
href="#n49" name="a49" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[49]</span></a> Berman-Yurin
and Fritz David decided to organize an attempt on Stalin at the XIIIth
Plenum of the Comintern in December 1933. According to Berman-Yurin
&#8220;the plan fell through,&#8221; because Fritz David had not been able to get a
pass for Berman-Yurin &#8220;who was supposed to fire at Stalin.&#8221; Fritz David
gives another version: &#8220;These projects failed because Stalin did not
attend the XIIIth Plenum.&#8221; This is a bit like the story of the borrowed
pot. First, he says, I returned the pot to him intact, second, it was
already cracked, third, I didn&#8217;t borrow anything from him at all. The
third part seems to be missing here, but in fact it is here too. There
was no pass, there was no Stalin and ... there was no attempt to
organize an attack.<br>

<br>
</p>
<p>But Fritz David and Berman-Yurin were not depressed by this failure.
In fact, &#8220;they had already elaborated two concrete (!) plans for
attacks on Stalin.&#8221; There remained the second plan: to carry out an
attack on Stalin at the VIIth Congress of the Comintern.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, this plan was brilliant; furthermore it
corresponded to Trotsky&#8217;s &#8220;directives,&#8221; which were not simply to kill
Stalin, but to do it without fail to the accompaniment of music and
ovations, &#8220;before an international forum,&#8221; according to the statement
made by Berman-Yurin. But from our Point of view, this plan still
contained a serious drawback. The last previous Congress of the
Comintern (the VIth) was held in 1928. From 1928 to 1933, more than
five years had already passed, and there was absolutely no mention of a
new congress. Violating the statutes of the Comintern, Stalin pushed it
back from year to year, with the intention, if possible, of never
convening it again. In the propaganda of the Left Opposition abroad
during those years, the question of the failure to convene the Congress
of the Comintern played a great role. Here is what Trotsky wrote, for
example, in December 1934 (one can find dozens of similar quotations):
&#8220;The ruling Stalinist group, basically, has long since waved good-bye
to the Comintern. One of the most obvious proofs of this is Stalin&#8217;s
refusal to convene an International Congress.&#8221; (<strong>Bulletin of the
Opposition</strong>, No. 41)</p>
<p>Berman-Yurin and Fritz David were sent by Trotsky, by the same
Trotsky who thought that the Congress would not be convened, and at the
same time, as Berman-Yurin testifies, who proposed to the latter &#8220;to
organize an attack at the Congress.&#8221; And so, instead of acting, our
&#8220;terrorists&#8221; wait ... for the Congress. They wait one year, they wait
two years, and finally two and a half years later, their patience is
rewarded. After a break of seven years, from 1928 to 1935, the VIIth
Congress is at last convened. One may retort: perhaps they waited a
long time, but on the other hand they had prepared the attack well and
&#8220;elaborated a concrete plan.&#8221; Let the court record speak: &#8220;At the
Congress of the Comintern, only Fritz David was able to get in, since
they could not obtain a pass for Berman-Yurin. Fritz David, according
to his own words, was not able to carry out his terrorist act because
it was impossible for him to get close to Stalin ... He, Fritz David,
sat in the loge, there were too many people in the loge and shooting
was out of the question.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obviously Fritz David had thought that he would be seated at the
Praesidium and &#8220;there would not be many people&#8221; ... at the Congress.</p>
<p>Thus the story ends. But how, one asks, did the GPU learn of all
that? Or did these &#8220;terrorists&#8221; go to the GPU on their own and tell
them about their failures? And if they had not made that mistake, they
would very probably not only be alive and well today, they would have
prepared, no less successfully, a new attack on Stalin, scheduled to
take place, let us say, at the VIIIth Congress of the Comintern (1940?
1945?).</p>
<p>And this is the <em>only</em> &#8220;concrete&#8221; attempt at an attack on
Stalin! Furthermore it seems that the court itself did not take this
GPU story very seriously, since it does not even mention it in its
verdict.</p>

<h4>2. The Terrorist Olberg Attacks Stalin</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p class="fst">Just like Berman-Yurin and Fritz David, Olberg &#8220;received
instructions&#8221; from Trotsky concerning terrorist activity. Trotsky had
never laid eyes on Olberg any more than he had Berman-Yurin and Fritz
David (although in contrast to the other two, he had heard of him, it
is true, only in a negative vein (see page 33).</p>
<p>Olberg made three trips to the USSR. After receiving &#8220;terrorist
instructions&#8221; in 1932, he left at the end of March (!) 1933 for the
Soviet Union and stayed there until July 1933; he &#8220;hid,&#8221; for some
reason, for a month and a half in Moscow, then he left for Stalinbad,
where he settled down as a history teacher. Stalinbad, which is some
distance from Moscow, and therefore also from all the top leaders, some
4000 km. at least, was evidently chosen by Olberg as the most favorable
location for his terrorist activity. But soon Olberg had to return to
Prague, because &#8220;his military papers were not in order.&#8221; Olberg went to
the USSR for the second time in March 1935, but he only spent several
days there, since he had a tourist visa. In July 1935, Olberg went to
the USSR for the third time. Olberg had made his last two trips with
the famous passport from the Republic of Honduras (the only material
proof officially mentioned in the case). &#8220;After spending a short time
in Minsk, [Olberg] left for Corky, linked up with Yelin and Fedotov,
and obtained work at the Gorky Pedagogical Institute where he remained
until the day of his arrest.&#8221;</p>
<p>In reading this unbelievable story, one might think there was no GPU
in the USSR! Vyshinsky shows great curiosity toward Olberg&#8217;s Honduras
passport: weren&#8217;t his parents in Honduras, or perhaps his grandmother?
One wonders why the GPU had not shown the same interest at the time of
Olberg&#8217;s trips! Whoever has any understanding of the conditions under
which visas are given for the USSR and the strict manner in which the
GPU watches even the &#8220;respectable&#8221; foreigners who arrive, will see how
unbelievable this story is. A man arrives (and not for the first time)
with an exotic and unreliable passport from the Republic of Honduras,
does not speak a word of the American languages, but speaks ...
Russian. It is hard to imagine a more suspicious foreigner.
Nevertheless, Olberg not only enters the USSR unhindered, leaves and
enters the USSR again, but he even obtains an official teaching
position at a State Pedagogical Institute! Let us state as
categorically as possible: <em>Olberg was able to receive a visa for
the USSR, to go there and obtain work only with the assistance of the
Soviet authorities, the GPU included</em>.</p>
<p>But let us return to the &#8220;terrorist&#8221; activity of Olberg. Three years
&#8212; from 1932 to 1935&#8212;went by without our hearing a word of this
activity. But having arrived in Gorky in July 1935, &#8220;Olberg learned
from Fedotov that terrorist combat groups had been organized before his
arrival. Olberg simply had to elaborate the actual plan of the attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let us note that neither Yelin nor Fedotov (who is none other than
the director of the pedagogical Institute where Olberg taught!) was
called to trial, neither as accused nor as a witness. Let us also note
that if terrorist &#8220;combat groups&#8221; organized by Fedotov had really
existed in Gorky, then it is simply incomprehensible why Fedotov needed
Olberg. A young man, with neither kith nor kin, having no notion of
terrorist activity or of conspiratorial activity in general, must lead
&#8212; &#8220;elaborate a plan!&#8221;&#8212;a terrorist organization already started by
much more experienced people. But what exactly did this notorious plan
consist of? &#8220;The terrorist act was to be carried out on May 1, 1936, in
Moscow&#8221;; this is all that we learn from the court records.  By whom? Where?
How? Not a word about any of that. &#8220;What prevented this plan from being
carried out?&#8221; asks Vyshinsky. &#8220;The arrest,&#8221; answers Olberg.</p>

<p>Such is the story of this &#8220;attack.&#8221; This, furthermore, does not
prevent a venal scribbler from <strong>Pravda</strong>, (L. Rovinsky,
August 22) from informing us that &#8220;Olberg&#8217;s terrorist and spy activity
was coming to a head ...&#8221; Not only was he &#8220;organizing terrorist
espionage groups,&#8221; but he was even &#8220;teaching the terrorists
marksmanship and bomb throwing.&#8221; In the court transcripts there was
never any question of marksmanship or throwing bombs. We doubt very
much that the student of political science, V. Olberg, had ever seen a
bomb, except for the &#8220;bomb&#8221; which Stalin prepared for him.</p>
<h4>3. The Attack by Lurie No.1 and Lurie No.2 on Voroshilov in
particular and on Others &#8220;in General&#8221;</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p class="fst">N. Lurie confirms that he had engaged in Trotskyist
activity since 1927, that is, for about nine years. Unfortunately, no
one knew anything about it. No Trotskyist from any country, either in
1927, or later, ever met N. Lurie. In all our attempts get information
about N. Lurie, we received the same answer from everyone: <em>unknown</em>.
Unfortunately, the GPU is not among our correspondents. It could
certainly give interesting information and tell us, in particular,
when, in 1927 or any other year, N. Lurie&#8217;s &#8220;activity&#8221; began.</p>
<p>N. Lurie describes the beginning of this terrorist activity in the
following way: &#8220;In the early part of 1932 Moishe Lurie told me that it
was time [!] to leave for the USSR and to carry out terrorist work
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>This free and easy tone is admirable in itself! We have played
billiards long enough, &#8220;It is time&#8221; to eat dinner ..., that is, to take
up &#8220;terrorism.&#8221; In Moscow, Lurie met with a certain Konstant and a
certain Lipshitz, whom he calls &#8220;German Trotskyists,&#8221; but who, once
again, are strangers to any true Trotskyist. (Let it be said in
passing, that neither Konstant, nor Lipshitz are brought to trial or
summoned as witnesses. That is the custom at this &#8220;model&#8221; trial!)</p>
<p>Lurie told Konstant about the &#8220;terrorist directives.&#8221; In the same
carefree tone, Konstant answers Lurie &#8220;that this is nothing new to
him.&#8221; (He undoubtedly knew about &#8220;this&#8221; since childhood.)</p>

<p>In August 1932, the N. Lurie group receives from a certain Franz
Weiss (a fascist secret agent, according to the court transcript) the
assignment to carry out an attack on Voroshilov. At the time of the
preliminary investigation, N. Lurie declared that the preparation of
this attack (in Moscow) had lasted <em>&#8220;from the fall of 1932 to the
end of 1933.&#8221;</em> But at the interrogation the same Lurie indicated
that already in <em>July 1933</em> he left for Cheliabinsk. If N.
Lurie moved in <em>July 1933 to Cheliabinsk</em>, one wonders how he
could have been preparing an attack in <em>Moscow until the end of 1933</em>.
Probably in order to &#8220;liquidate this hitch,&#8221; at the trial, N. Lurie
gives a new version: &#8220;We were occupied with it [with the preparation of
the attack against Voroshilov] from September 1932 <em>until the
spring of 1933.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Until the spring or until the end</em> of 1933?! The court
naturally passes over this contradiction in silence.</p>

<p>But what did the actual preparation of the attack consist of? The
troika&#8212;N. Lurie, Konstant, Lipshitz&#8212;which, for reasons unknown, is
represented at the trial only by Lurie, watched when Voroshilov would
leave, but the car &#8220;went too fast. It is hopeless to fire at a swiftly
moving car,&#8221; (the testimony of N. Lurie). Having convinced themselves
that the car was travelling too fast, these unfortunate terrorists
ceased any further surveillance of Voroshilov&#8217;s departures. When the
trial chairman asks them what they did next, N. Lurie replies that they
directed their attention toward the acquisition of explosives in order
to accomplish the terrorist act by means of a bomb. The court makes no
attempt to bring to light whether they procured any explosives, where,
how, whether a bomb was made, etc. With this, the case is closed. In
July 1933, N. Lurie leaves for Cheliabinsk to work as a physician. But
even in faraway &#8220;Cheliabinsk Lurie didn&#8217;t halt his terrorist activity.&#8221;
He waits, don&#8217;t you see, for some leader, Kaganovich or Ordzhonikidze,
to come to Cheliabinsk. But neither Kaganovich nor Ordzhonikidze, as if
on purpose, comes to Cheliabinsk; in any case, N. Lurie does not meet
any of them there and does not commit, of course, any attack.<a id="a50"
href="#n50" name="a50" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[50]</span></a></p>
<p>This does not prevent Moishe Lurie from pointing out &#8220;how he
organized [!] the attack on Comrade Ordzhonikidze ... To this end, M.
Lurie proposed that N. Lurie, who was leaving for the tractor factory
in Cheliabinsk, use the eventual arrival of Ordzhonikidze at the
factory for the realization of the terrorist act!&#8221;</p>
<p>N. Lurie remains two and a half years in Cheliabinsk fruitlessly
awaiting Ordzhonikidze or Kaganovich. But as the proverb says, if the
mountain will not come to Mohammed, Mohammed must go to the mountain.
N. Lurie leaves for Leningrad. Passing through
Moscow, Moishe Lurie orders him in January 1936 to &#8220;shoot Zhdanov
during the May 1st demonstration in Leningrad.&#8221; (Why it was necessary
to assassinate Zhdonov, is impossible to figure out.) During the May
1st demonstration, N. Lurie marches in the column of demonstrators, but
does not try to shoot. When the trial chairman asks him why, he
answers: &#8220;We passed too far away.&#8221; And this rubbish is served up at the
trial as attacks!</p>
<h4>4. One More Attack on Voroshilov</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p class="fst">During the trial, there is mentioned the preparation of
one more terrorist act against Voroshilov, which supposedly was to be
carried out by two important soldiers, both famous heroes of the Civil
War: D. Schmidt and Kuzmichev. Obviously, no proof is introduced.
Neither Schmidt, nor Kuzmichev, nor any other soldier accused of
terrorist activity&#8212;Putna, Esterman, Gaevsky&#8212;was brought to trial.
Three defendants do mention the &#8220;terrorist&#8221; activity of
Schmidt-Kuzmichev. Reingold testifies that &#8220;he learned from Mrachkovsky
and Dreitzer that in the <em>summer of 1933</em> there was organized
... a Trotskyist military group consisting of Schmidt, commander of one
of the Red Army brigades, Kuzmichev, staff commander of one of the
military units, and a number [!] of others.&#8221; Mrachkovsky testifies that
things took place a year later. &#8220;<em>In the middle of 1934</em>,
Dreitzer reported to me that he was simultaneously preparing
Voroshilov&#8217;s assassination, for which Schmidt Dmitrii would have to be
prepared ...&#8221; Dreitzer himself testified during the prosecutor&#8217;s
cross-examination that, &#8220;I enlisted the services of Esterman and
Gaevsky for the terrorist act, and added Schmidt and Kuzmichev <em>in
1935</em>. The latter ones took up the task of killing Voroshilov.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus all three testimonies (and there is no other testimony about
this matter) radically contradict one another: 1933, 1931, 1936&#8212;they
therefore have to be discarded as crude lies.<a id="a51" href="#n51"
name="a51" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[51]</span></a></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="40%">
<br>
<p class="fst">During the trial, other attempted attacks are also
mentioned; but these last have not even a shadow of proof. Thus, for
example, Zinoviev testifies that &#8220;he knew about two attempts on
Stalin&#8217;s life in which Reingold, Dreitzer and Pikel took part.&#8221; Neither
Dreitzer nor Reingold mentions these &#8220;attempts.&#8221; Pikel testifies &#8220;that
in the autumn of 1933 Bogdan had made a new [?] attempt at an attack on
Stalin&#8217;s life.&#8221; He also testifies &#8220;about the preparation of a terrorist
act against Stalin in 1934&#8221;; while his participation &#8220;was limited to
having put Bakaev in touch with Radin&#8221; (the latter is also not brought
to trial). Bakaev also makes it known that &#8220;in October 1934, under the
leadership of Kamenev, Evdokimov and himself (Bakaev), an attack
against Stalin was prepared in Moscow ... This attack did not succeed.&#8221;
<em>And that is all</em>.</p>
<p>The court accepts all these declarations indifferently, does not at
all try to clarify the circumstances, the character, the time, the
place, etc. of these &#8220;attacks.&#8221; The absence of any facts about these
attacks does not permit us to examine them in greater detail.</p>
<p>Let us note in conclusion that the verdict says: &#8220;the
Trotskyist-Zinovievist Unified Center prepared a series of terrorist
groups and a series of terrorist acts against Comrades Stalin,
Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Kirov, Ordzhonikidze, Zhdanov Kossior,
Postyshev and others.&#8221; <a id="a52" href="#n52" name="a52" target="_blank" ><span
class="note">[52]</span></a></p>
<p>We have tried above to assiduously select and systematically examine
all the <em>facts about the attacks</em> which are scattered
throughout the court transcripts. If one considers N. Lurie&#8217;s trip to
Cheliabinsk an &#8220;attack on Ordzhonikidze and Kaganovich&#8221; and his trip to
Leningrad an &#8220;attack on Zhdanov,&#8221; then there still remain nonetheless
&#8220;Postyshev, Kossior and others ...&#8221; In the whole trial not one word is
said about attacks against them. This does not prevent the court from
placing the following paragraph in the verdict: &#8220;The court
investigation has also established that the Trotskyist-Zinovievist
terrorist center ... prepared terrorist acts against comrades Kossior
and Postyshev, through a Ukrainian terrorist group which acted under
the leadership of the Trotskyist Mukhin.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Ukrainian terrorist group and the very name of its leader Mukhin
<em>are mentioned at the trial for the first time in the verdict!</em>
The story of Mukhin and his group was obviously improvised at the last
moment so that Postyshev and Kossior would not be offended.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="40%">
<br>
<p class="fst">Let us draw up the balance sheet on the basis of the
trial evidence itself. There was not a single attack, there was not
even a single attempt at an attach. The prosecutor Vyshinsky
nonetheless considers that &#8220;the guilt is so clearly established that he
can free himself from the obligation to analyze the materials gathered
by the court investigation.&#8221; He even adds: &#8220;What is essential in this
trial, is that they (the accused) transformed their
counter-revolutionary thoughts into counter-revolutionary deeds, their
counter-revolutionary theory into terrorist practice: not only do they
talk of shooting, but they shoot; they shoot and they kill!&#8221;</p>
<p>So they shoot?! At the trial it was not, in any case, mentioned that
any of the defendants had fired a shot. There were &#8220;instructions,&#8221;
&#8220;conversations,&#8221; &#8220;preparations,&#8221; &#8220;attempts,&#8221; &#8220;people were picked out,&#8221;
now the terrorist activity was &#8220;speeded up,&#8221; now it was &#8220;halted,&#8221; &#8212;
there was all that in words, but not a shot was fired. <em>Not one
attack, not one real attempt at an attack was established in court</em>.
Sometimes it turned out, as if on purpose, that it was too far to
shoot, or that the terrorist marched by too far away, or that the car
was moving too fast, or that the terrorist happened to be in Stalinblad
or Cheliabinsk, while Stalin, as if by chance, was in Moscow.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, these &#8220;terrorists&#8221; were placed in exceptionally
favorable conditions. The usual difficulties of terrorists&#8212;belonging
to different social layers ... or lacking information about the
targets, or being unable to penetrate into their milieu&#8212;here all this
was completely absent.</p>
<p>After breaking from the Opposition, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Smirnov,
Mrachkovsky, Bakaev and others moved in the circles of the apparatus.
They were well received at the Kremlin, in all the institutions, some
even in Stalin&#8217;s secretariat. Mrachkovsky, for example, was given a
personal reception by Stalin; <a id="a53" href="#n53" name="a53" target="_blank" ><span
class="note">[53]</span></a> it would not have taken much for him to
discharge his revolver into Stalin. The terrorist opportunities of the
majority of those shot, famous Bolsheviks, were almost unlimited. In
addition, they were helped from abroad by Trotsky, and in the USSR, by
dozens, if not hundreds, of people; they got support from an
organization as powerful as the Gestapo! And the results? Zero! Zero!
If there were no assassinations, it is only because <em>none of the
people who were shot or mentioned in the case had prepared any
assassinations</em>, none of them had had the idea of searching along
the road of terror for a way out from the Stalinist dead end.</p>

<p>Without Kirov&#8217;s assassination, Stalin would never have decided to
start circulating all these wild lies about &#8220;terror.&#8221; This is why he
artificially combined reality&#8212;Kirov&#8217;s assassination by Nikolaev, an
assassination with which none of the defendants in the trial had any
connection&#8212;with all the other inventions, This artificial concoction
is the content of the central police combination of the Moscow trial.
The reality of Kirov&#8217;s assassination was to give the <em>appearance</em>
of reality to other attacks&#8212;which did not take place.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<p class="note"><a id="n49" href="#a49" name="n49" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[49]</span></a>
It is highly characteristic that all the terrorists &#8220;sent&#8221; by Trotsky,
i.e., Berman-Yurin, Fritz David, Moishe Lurie and others, all left for
the USSR in March, 1933. Is this not explained by the fact that they
were in reality &#8220;sent&#8221; to the USSR, not by Trotsky, but by Hitler, who
had just taken power in Germany with the help of Stalin and all his
Berman-Yurins? While the German revolutionary workers were dispatched
to concentration camps, the Stalinist functionaries, including
Berman-Yurin, Fritz David and all the others, left for Moscow. (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n50" href="#a50" name="n50" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[50]</span></a>
Nevertheless the verdict says that &#8220;N. Lurie tried (?) to carry out an
attack on the life of Cdes. Kaganovich and Ordkzonikidze.&#8221; The same
Nathan Lurie is accused in the verdict of preparing an attack on Stalin
as well. In the court transcripts regarding the attack of N. Lurie on
Stalin there is not one word! (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n51" href="#a51" name="n51" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[51]</span></a>
The presiding judge makes no attempt in the course of the trial to
clear up the contradictions, to bring to trial the people mentioned in
this case, etc. But he suddenly shows a great interest in the exact
type of revolver N. Lurie had: a Browning? what kind! medium caliber?
What pathetic play-acting! (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n52" href="#a52" name="n52" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[52]</span></a>
We will lay aside one, completely anecdotal incident. &#8220;The terrorist&#8221;
Yakovlev, who, along with Safonova were the sole witnesses at the trial
(why witnesses and not defendants is inexplicabe), testified that
Kamenev ordered him to organize a terrorist group ... at the Academy of
Sciences. (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n53" href="#a53" name="n53" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[53]</span></a>
Safonova testified about this reception, saying that &#8220;Mrachkovsky told
us (Safonova and I.N. Smirnov) about the conversation with Stalin ...
and said that the only answer was to kill Stalin.&#8221; If all of this is
not made up from beginning to end (I.N. Smirnov flatly denied the
Safonova story), then probably this is what happened: upon returning
from the reception with Stalin, Mrachkovsky was greatly disappointed &#8212;
there is nothing surprising about that&#8212;and sharply attacked Stalin.
Hence Safonova, freely moving back the date, &#8220;laid the basis&#8221; for the
