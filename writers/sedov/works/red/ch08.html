<h4>On the Moscow Trials</h4>

<h1>WHEN EXACTLY WAS THE &#8220;UNIFIED CENTER&#8221; CREATED AND WHEN DID IT FUNCTION?</h1>

<br />
 
<hr class="base" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p>Here is what the indictment says: <em>&#8220;At the end of 1932</em> the
unification of the Trotskyist and Zinovievist groups took place and
they organized a unified center ...&#8221;</p>
<p>Organized at the end of 1932, this center, according to the
indictment, carried on terrorist activity for almost four years: <em>&#8220;from
1932 to 1936.&#8221;</em> It is the end of 1932 which is considered the
moment&#8212;and that is repeated dozens of times during the trial&#8212;when
the Zinovievists on the one hand, and the so-called &#8220;Trotskyists&#8221;
(Smirnov and others), on the other hand, supposedly obeyed Trotsky&#8217;s
instructions and created the Unified Center, &#8220;which gave itself the
task of executing a series of terrorist acts.&#8221;</p>
<p>What happened next? Here is what a number of the defendants and
Bakaev in particular, say: &#8220;In the autumn of 1932, Zinoviev and Kamenev
had been expelled from the party ... it was decided to temporarily
suspend the terrorist activity. In the autumn of 1934 it was taken up
again.&#8221; Reingold also says: &#8220;In our terrorist activity ... between the
autumn of 1932 and the summer of 1933 there was a break, beginning with
the autumn of 1932.&#8221; The inconsistencies concern only the time when
this activity was resumed. It thus turns out that the center which was
formed at <em>the end of 1932</em> had already ceased its activity for
a while ... before its formation, in the autumn of 1932. <a id="a36"
href="#n36" name="a36" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[36]</span></a></p>

<p>In reality, to demonstrate that the center (if it had ever existed)
could not do otherwise than cease its activity in the autumn of 1932,
we do not need this testimony. The fact is that in the autumn of 1932
(in October) Zinoviev and Kamenev were exiled from Moscow, and in the
winter(on January 1, 1933) Smirnov was arrested. Mrachkovsky was also
outside Moscow; he was, according to the information available at that
time, deported, as were Ter-Vaganian and a number of other former
Oppositionists. We can see that from the autumn of 1932 and until at
least the summer of 1933 (the return of Zinoviev and Kamenev from
exile), the center could not in fact exist.</p>
<p>This does not stop Dreitzer from stating that in the <em>spring</em>
of 1933 he received &#8220;instructions from the Trotskyist-Zinovievist
center to hasten the terrorist acts against the leadership of the
Communist party in the USSR.&#8221; According to Dreitzer, consequently, it
turns out that, just in the period in which the center &#8220;had ceased its
activity,&#8221; it demanded that he &#8220;hasten&#8221; the preparation of the
terrorist acts.</p>
<p>In this jumble of absurdities, it is difficult to understand
anything at all! The center is organized and dissolved all at once,
ceases its activity and at the same time &#8220;hastens&#8221; it.</p>
<p>There is no less confusion tied to the question of exactly when the
center finally &#8220;resumed&#8221; its mysterious activity. Bakaev, who answers
this question the most precisely, says: &#8220;In the autumn of 1934,&#8221; that
is, two years later. This date is not chosen accidentally. It must be a
preparation for the &#8220;confession&#8221; of Kirov&#8217;s assassination. If we
believe Bakaev&#8217;s testimony, the only period in which the center existed
and involved itself in terrorist activity was the second half, and, in
particular, the autumn of 1934, that is, a period of only a few months.
If we accept the version of the other defendants (Pikel, Reingold,
Zinoviev, Kamenev), the center existed and acted from the summer or
autumn of 1933 to the end of 1934, that is, one year and a half <em>at
the very most</em>. Meanwhile, the indictment and the verdict say that
the center existed from 1932 to 1936. In order to demonstrate that this
statement is not unfounded, Vyshinsky asks Zinoviev the following
question: &#8220;For how long did it (the center) function?&#8221; Zinoviev
answers: &#8220;In fact, <em>until 1936</em>.&#8221; <a id="a37" href="#n37"
name="a37" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[37]</span></a> This testimony of
Zinoviev&#8217;s is at least strange, since he himself, like Evdokimov,
Bakaev, and Kamenev had been in prison since December 1934. (Since the
end of 1934, none of the members of the center had been in Moscow.)
Obviously, from the end of 1934 to 1936 they engaged in terrorist
activity ... in prison. Another member of the center, Mrachkovsky,
during the four years of his &#8220;terrorist activity&#8221; was in Moscow only
twice, in 1932 and in 1934, and even these were only short visits. How
he was able, under these conditions, to work actively in the center is
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Besides this, <em>one of the members of the center, I.N. Smirnov,
never left prison after January 1, 1933, that is, for more than three
and one half years</em>. One wonders what role I.N. Smirnov could have
played in the activity of the center since he was arrested in the
period when this center had just been organized, and how, in
particular, he could have taken an active part in Kirov&#8217;s assassination
when he was in prison, without interruption, for the two years which
preceded the assassination. But the verdict says in black and white &#8212;
and Smirnov was shot in accordance with this verdict&#8212;that he is
accused of &#8220;having organized and carried out on December 1, 1934 ...
the assassination of S.M. Kirov.&#8221; Is this not a &#8220;model trial&#8221;?</p>
<p>Vyshinsky, it is true, also has a reply to that. Regarding the
terrorist directives which Dreitzer was supposed to have received (in
1934), that is, when Smirnov had already been in prison for a long
time, the prosecutor Vyshinsky says: &#8220;I am deeply (!) convinced (!!)
that you knew about it (the terrorist directive) even while you were
being held in the political isolator.&#8221; The material proofs are replaced
by false &#8220;confessions&#8221; and mind-reading.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="40%">
<br>
<p>During the trial, several meetings are mentioned: in Zinoviev and
Kamenev&#8217;s country house in Ilinskoe, in Zinoviev&#8217;s apartment, in
Kamenev&#8217;s apartment and in Mrachkovsky&#8217;s railroad car. The first three
were made up exclusively of Zinovievists; the last one, in
Mrachkovsky&#8217;s railroad car, was, on the contrary, made up of former
Trotskyists (which the exception of Evdokimov). Furthermore, the very
fact of the last meeting is formally denied by I.N. Smirnov. These
meetings, if they really took place, were not and could not have been
sessions of the &#8220;Unified&#8221; Center, since they were only meetings of a <em>single</em>
group. The court furthermore does not attempt to present these meetings
as assemblies of the Unified Center.</p>
<p>With the object of crushing Smirnov, Vyshinsky asks Zinoviev: &#8220;And
did you personally hear from Smirnov a series of propositions
(concerning terror)?&#8221; Zinoviev: &#8220;I personally held talks with him on
two or three occasions.&#8221;</p>
<p>This dialogue, by the way, exposes the fictitious character of the
center. It turns out that during the entire terrorist activity, the two
most outstanding members of the center &#8220;held talks&#8221; only &#8220;on two or
three occasions.&#8221; And the common work of the center? The joint
participation in its sessions? Of this&#8212;not a word!</p>

<p><em>Thus, during the trial, there is no evidence of any kind which
would permit one to say that the &#8220;Unified Center&#8221; ever met, even once,
or even once carried out any decision at all</em>.</p>
<p>And as for I.N. Smirnov, who had started making &#8220;confessions&#8221; during
the preliminary investigation, when it came to the trial he made an
attempt to stop; <a id="a38" href="#n38" name="a38" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[38]</span></a>
on the question of the Center, the following dialogue took place with
the prosecutor:</p>
<p><em>Vyshinsky:</em> When did you leave the center?</p>
<p><em>Smirnov:</em> I did not have to leave it, there was nothing that
I might have left.</p>
<p><em>Vyshinsky:</em> Did the center exist?</p>

<p><em>Smirnov:</em> But what center ...? <a id="a39" href="#n39"
name="a39" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[39]</span></a></p>
<p>The trial record is also forced to say that Smirnov confirmed these
words by referring to the fact that &#8220;the center did not meet.&#8221; With
this testimony, Smirnov struck the last blow to the legend of the
&#8220;Unified Center.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is it worthwhile to dwell on the fact that neither the court, nor
the prosecutor tries to look into all these contradictions? Rightly
fearing that by &#8220;deepening&#8221; the investigation they would be threatened
with even more disagreeable contradictions, they quite reasonably
prefer not to dwell on them.</p>
<p>The attentive reader of the trial records who has little experience
with Stalinist amalgams cannot help but say to himself: &#8220;What a bizarre
center! It is impossible to establish its exact composition, the moment
of its creation, or the period of its activity; it did not meet a
single time. What it did in general is unknown!&#8221; Certainly, this center
would be very bizarre, if ... if it had ever existed. <a id="a40"
href="#n40" name="a40" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[40]</span></a></p>
<hr class="base" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<p class="note"><a id="n36" href="#a36" name="n36" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[36]</span></a>

In the verdict an attempt was made to correct the situation by saying
that the center arose not at the end of 1932, but in the autumn of
1932. That changes nothing in the case. It turns out that the center
was organized and at the same time ceased its activity. It was
undoubtedly organized with the special object .... ceasing its
activity. (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n37" href="#a37" name="n37" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[37]</span></a>
Citing in his indictment speech the words of Zinoviev, &#8220;until 1936,&#8221;
Vyshinsky changes 1936 to 1934, fearing, evidently, that otherwise the
lie would be too crude to get away with. (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n38" href="#a38" name="n38" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[38]</span></a>
This explains why Smirnov&#8217;s depositions in court contradict in some
measure the depositions at the time of the investigation. Not having
the courage to openly break with the &#8220;confessions&#8221; extorted by the GPU
and to tell the whole truth, Smirnov tried nonetheless to put up
resistance during the trial. Justice demands that we note that Smirnov
conducted himself somewhat better than the other defendants. <span
style="font-style: italic;">(L.S.)</span></p>
<p class="note"><a id="n39" href="#a39" name="n39" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[39]</span></a>

This is the official translation from the <strong>International
Correspondence</strong> (special number for the trial). Smirnov&#8217;s reply
corresponds, rather, in English, to the exclamation, <em>Come on!</em>
(<em>L.S.</em>)</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n40" href="#a40" name="n40" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[40]</span></a>
Besides the Unified Center there also appears in the trial a certain
terrorist Center of Moscow (not to be confused with the Zinovievist
Moscow Center of 1934!) The official composition of this center is:
Dreitzer, Reingold and Pikel. It would be easy to show that everything
we have said on the question of the Unified Center could more or less
apply to this &#8220;center.&#8221; Its composition varies according to different
testimony. This &#8220;center&#8221; was organized by Mrachkovsky before his
departure from Moscow in 1932. Returning to Moscow nearly two years
later, Mrachliovsky hears a report from the director of this center,
Dreitzer, according to whom ... the Moscow center has been organized
and so on, all in the same spirit. (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>
