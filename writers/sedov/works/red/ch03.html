<h1>THE ASSASSINATION OF KIROV</h1>

<br />
 

<hr class="base" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p class="fst">All the latest Stalinist amalgams have been constructed
over Kirov&#8217;s corpse. To see clearly into the Moscow trials, one must
first of all recall the history of this assassination and the
circumstances connected with it.</p>
<p>On December 1, 1934 in Leningrad, the terrorist Nikolaev
assassinated Kirov.</p>
<p>For more than two weeks, nothing was known of the assassin
personally, or of the nature of the assassination.</p>
<p>On the 6th, 12th, and 18th of December the Soviet newspapers printed
the news of the execution of terrorist White Guards (104 people in
all), the majority of whom had come to the USSR illegally from Poland,
Latvia, Finland and Romania. They created the impression that these
people were shot in connection with the Nikolaev affair, that is, that
Nikolaev had been connected with White Guards.</p>
<p>On December 17, sixteen days after the assassination, in resolutions
of party organizations on the assassination of Kirov, came the first
mention that Nikolaev had at one time been a member of the &#8220;Zinovievist
anti-party group.&#8221; (Furthermore, the entire Leningrad party
organization had joined this group in 1926.)</p>

<p>The mention of Nikolaev as a &#8220;Zinovievist&#8221; revealed Stalin&#8217;s
intentions at one stroke: to attempt to implicate the Left Opposition
and Trotsky in the assassination of Kirov, by means of the old
Zinovievist group which, although it had broken with the Opposition in
January 1928, was easier, from the policeman&#8217; s point of view, to draw
into the case.</p>
<p>On December 22, Tass <a id="a16" href="#n16" name="a16" target="_blank" ><span
class="note">[16]</span></a> announced that in connection with the
assassination of Kirov, fourteen old Zinovievists had been arrested
(Kotolynov, Shatsky, Mandelstam and others), the majority of whom were
supposedly part of a so-called &#8220;Leningrad Center.&#8221; This center, whose
existence was Far from proven, was characterized by the news as
&#8220;closed&#8221;; it said nothing of Zinoviev, Kamenev, or of any other known
Zinovievist.</p>
<p>On December 23, new information was published indicating that a week
before (on December 16), Zinoviev, Kamenev, Evdokimov, Bakaev, etc, had
already been arrested in connection with the Nikolaev affair; for seven
of them, including Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Evdokimov, &#8220;given the absence
of sufficient evidence,&#8221; judicial prosecution would not be undertaken;
they would be handed over to the GPU for administrative punishment.</p>
<p>On December 27 the newspapers published the formal indictment for
the case of Nikolaev, Kotolynov and others, in which there was not a
word mentioned about the Zinoviev group and its participation in
Kirov&#8217;s assassination. <a id="a17" href="#n17" name="a17" target="_blank" ><span
class="note">[17]</span></a></p>
<p>On December 28 and 29 the trial of the fourteen (Nikolaev, Kotolynov
and others) took place, and, as we know, they were condemned to death
and shot.</p>
<p>At the trial of the fourteen, the overwhelming majority of the
defendants, in spite of a four-week investigation, did not admit their
participation in Kirov&#8217;s assassination. Besides Nikolaev, only Zvezdov
and Antonov admitted it fully and Yuzkin partially, that is, four out
of the fourteen.</p>
<p>If, as it is turns out according to the new version at the Moscow
trial, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bakaev and the others were not only connected
with the Leningrad Center, which is supposed to have committed the
murder of Kirov, but also immediately and practically directed the
assassination, how can one explain that an investigation conducted for
an entire month established absolutely no evidence in this respect? Why
would the defendants who gave full depositions have decided to conceal
at all costs precisely the role of Zinoviev, Kamenev and the others?
Why would the participation of these men have been concealed as well by
the GPU agent <a id="a18" href="#n18" name="a18" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[18]</span></a>

who was located in Nikolaev&#8217;s entourage?</p>
<p>The only explanation for it is that Zinoviev, Kamenev, and the
others had nothing to do with Kirov&#8217;s assassination. It is precisely
for that reason that, as long as they had not yet been completely
broken, they could not be accused of Kirov&#8217;s assassination.</p>
<p>On January 16, 1935 the Soviet newspapers published the formal
indictment in the case of the so-called Moscow Center, with Zinoviev,
Kamenev, Evdokimov and the others at its head.</p>
<p>Zinoviev, Kamenev, Evdokimov and the others, whom the press had only
a few weeks earlier declared as having no part in Kirov&#8217;s
assassination, were now being brought to trial in connection with this
murder. The case took a new turn. On January 15 and 16 the court
pronounced judgment on the fate of Zinoviev, Kamenev, et al., 19
defendants in all. They were accused of striving for the &#8220;restoration
of capitalism&#8221; and of counter-revolutionary activity in general. Not a
single concrete fact, no proof, was introduced by the prosecution.
During the trial, it was only stated that by their &#8220;malevolent
criticism,&#8221; by &#8220;spreading rumors,&#8221; Zinoviev, Kamenev, et al, had
encouraged terrorist moods, and that consequently they bore the
political and moral responsibility for the Kirov murder. At the same
time, the court considered it established that none of the accused had
anything to do with the assassination itself, although there had been
no doubt on this subject in the mind of any man who was the least bit
informed and politically experienced. If Zinoviev, Kamenev and the
others had had the slightest hand in Kirov&#8217;s assassination how could
one explain, once again, that the new investigation (from December 16,
1934 to January 15, 1935) had also not uncovered a single thread
leading to Kirov&#8217;s murder? And in the Zinoviev-Kamenev affair dozens of
people were implicated who were already demoralized for the most part
and who accused themselves and others of non-existent crimes. Yet none
of them, either by word or by allusion, be it ever so &#8220;unintentional,&#8221;
gave into the hands of the GPU the thread leading to the participation
of Zinoviev, Kamenev and others in Kirov&#8217;s assassination!</p>
<p>Stalin had to content himself in 1935 with the admission by Zinoviev
and the others of &#8220;political and moral responsibility&#8221; for Kirov&#8217;s
murder, and even this admission was wrenched from them under the threat
of the firing squad. But by the insolent and deliberately ambiguous
formulation of the verdict,&#8212;&#8220;the investigation has not established
the facts&#8221; of the participation of Zinoviev and the others in Kirov&#8217;s
assassination,&#8212;Stalin retained the possibility of &#8220;developing&#8221; the
case in the future, depending on how the situation worked out.</p>
<p>All the accused avoided the firing squad at that time. They were
sentenced to long prison terms. Even then it was totally clear that the
arrest and conviction of Zinoviev and Kamenev were provoked not by
their activity (it was nonexistent), but by Stalin&#8217;s plans: striking at
this group meant striking at all the oppositionist moods in the
country, in particular inside the bureaucracy itself, where Zinoviev
and Kamenev still showed certain authority, and above all&#8212;striking
out at &#8220;Trotskyism.&#8221;</p>
<p>No sooner had the trial of Zinoviev and Kamenev come to its end,
than a new case, the <em>third</em> case in connection with Kirov&#8217;s
assassination, had begun. On January 23, 1935, twelve leaders of the
Leningrad GPU appeared before the military Tribunal under the following
indictment: &#8220;While having information at their disposal on an attempt
being prepared against Kirov ... they had demonstrated an attitude
which was not only careless, but also criminally negligent ... by not
taking the necessary measures.&#8221;</p>

<p>We thus learned, with complete surprise, that the GPU had <em>&#8220;information
at their disposal&#8221;</em> about the attempt being prepared against Kirov,
and that the heads of the Leningrad GPU <em>&#8220;had not taken measures</em>
to bring to light and stop the activity of Kirov&#8217;s assassin in
Leningrad, L. Nikolaev, <em>even though they had all the necessary
opportunities to do so.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>In what way could the GPU have known and had &#8220;every necessary
opportunity?&#8221; <em>In only one way: amongst the Leningrad terrorists,
the GPU had an agent provocateur</em> (perhaps even more than one),
directly associated with Nikolaev.</p>
<p>The trial of the members of the Leningrad GPU and the very
formulation of the verdict demonstrate irrefutably that Kirov&#8217;s
assassination did not happen without the GPU having had a hand in it.
The verdict states literally that &#8220;they were informed (sic!) of the
attempt being prepared against Kirov ... and they acted with criminal
negligence.&#8221; Trotsky had already explained in his pamphlet devoted to
Kirov&#8217;s murder that &#8220;negligence&#8221; had nothing to do with it and that:
&#8220;When the preparation of the terrorist attack, of which the GPU knew,
had already begun, the task of Medved (chief of the GPU in Leningrad)
and his collaborators was not at all to arrest the conspirators&#8212;that
would have been too simple&#8212;it was necessary to find the appropriate
consul, to put him in touch with Nikolaev ... and establish a link
between the Zinoviev-Kamenev group and the Leningrad terrorists. It was
not an easy job. It demanded time and Nikolaev refused to wait.</p>
<p>Medved was an instrument in the hands of Stalin-Yagoda, nothing
more. <em>Stalin consequently bears not only the political but also
the direct responsibility for Kirov&#8217;s assassination</em>. Certainly
Stalin and the GPU did not want this assassination, they were counting
on arresting the terrorists at the last moment, but while preparing the
amalgam (between the consul and Trotsky) they &#8220;played with Kirov&#8217;s
head.&#8221; This game was interrupted by Nikolaev&#8217;s premature pistol shot.
Left unfinished, the combination made between the consul and Trotsky
collapsed pitifully. Even the trial against Zinoviev and Kamenev had to
be built upon accusations &#8220;in general&#8221; without any possibility of
linking them with Kirov&#8217;s assassination. Now, about a year and a half
later, without the least new fact, a new case the fourth!&#8212;has come to
fruition in the backstage area of the GPU around Kirov&#8217;s body:
Zinoviev, Kamenev and others, it turns out, organized and carried out
Kirov&#8217;s assassination.</p>

<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="40%">
<br>
<p class="fst">The fact that the terrorist activity of Zinoviev and the
others could not be established earlier is explained, according to the
GPU, by the exclusive secrecy of the conspirators.</p>
<p>Is this true? The Moscow trial gives a completely contradictory
picture. In theory, there is an extraordinary conspiracy, which goes so
far as to plan the murders of those who carried out the terrorist acts
after the seizure of power, in order to erase every trace; in practice,
there is incessant chatter about terror, endless meetings, trips,
communications.</p>
<p>Let us demonstrate this with the facts. In order to prepare Kirov&#8217;s
murder, Bakaev goes to Leningrad and joins Kotolynov, Levin,
Rumiantsev, Mandelstam, and Miasnikov. <a id="a19" href="#n19"
name="a19" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[19]</span></a> (These are all people
who were executed in the Nikolaev affair.) Bakaev meets five people!
But that is not enough for him.</p>
<p>It turns out that he has not gone to Leningrad alone, but with some
&#8220;Trotskyist-terrorist&#8221; (whose name is not cited and whose identity the
court does not even attempt to establish.) As if Bakaev were visibly
trying to fail, he asks to &#8220;assemble the men.&#8221; &#8220;A little later, in
Levin&#8217;s apartment were gathered, in addition to himself and Mandelstam,
Sositsky, Vladimir Rumiantsev, Kotolynov and Miasnikov&#8221; (at this
meeting the only one missing is Medved!). <a id="a20" href="#n20"
name="a20" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[20]</span></a> Evidently thinking that
everything had not yet been done to make sure that the affair would be
discovered, Bakaev also asks that he be introduced to Nikolaev
personally. He meets with Nikolaev and discusses Kirov&#8217;s assassination
with him and not with him alone, but in the presence of the same
&#8220;anonymous&#8221; Trotskyist, as if he were trying hard to have a witness.</p>
<p>Still another interesting detail. At the time of his journey to
Leningrad, Levin meets Bakaev at the station. He complains to him:
&#8220;Well, Grigori Evseievich (Zinoviev) does not trust Gertik or Kuklin or
even Evdokimov.&#8221; Thus we learn&#8212;it was also mentioned in the
indictment&#8212;that Gertik, Kuklin and Evdokimov were also connected with
the Leningrad terrorists. And this is called &#8220;secrecy&#8221;!</p>

<p>Zinoviev not only personally sends Bakaev, Gertik, Kuklin and
Evdokimov (and later, as we will see, Kamenev himself) to Leningrad to
make contact with the terrorists, but further considers it necessary to
talk about it right and left. Thus, for example, Reingold, who,
according to the court evidence, took no direct part in the terrorist
act against Kirov, declares: &#8220;I learned from Zinoviev himself that
Kirov&#8217;s assassination in Leningrad was prepared under his own direction
...&#8221; It seems that Zinoviev is very worried that his personal role in
the assassination of Kirov will remain unnoticed and insufficiently
appreciated. The same Reingold indicates that Faivilovich also kept in
touch with the Leningrad terrorists.</p>
<p>Bakaev indicates that Kirov&#8217;s murder was also entrusted to Karev,
while Evdokimov proposed to put Karev in touch with Levin and Anishev.
Of course, that seemed insufficient to Zinoviev and he proposed to &#8220;put
Bakaev, in Leningrad, in touch with Rumiantsev as well.&#8221; Thus Karev is
linked to Levin, Anishev and Rumiantsev. In addition, Bakaev, during a
&#8220;conversation,&#8221; informs Karev of the existence of Kotolynov&#8217;s terrorist
group. The affair does not stop there. It turns out that in June 1934,
Kamenev went personally to Leningrad; &#8220;where he ordered the active
Zinovievist, Yakovlev, to prepare, parallel to the Nikolaev-Kotolynov
group, an attempt on Kirov&#8221;; in addition Kamenev tells Yakovlev that
other groups are preparing terrorist acts as well: in Moscow against
Stalin; in Leningrad, the Rumiantsev-Kotolynov group against Kirov.</p>
<p>In search of new listeners, Zinoviev relates his terrorist
intentions to&#8212;everyone! everyone!&#8212;Matorin and Pikel, while Pikel
puts Bakaev in contact with another &#8220;terrorist,&#8221; Radin.</p>
<p>After an absence of almost two years, Mrachkovsky returns to Moscow
in the summer of 1934. Kamenev tells him immediately that &#8220;in Leningrad
Bakaev is organizing ... a terrorist act against Kirov.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evdokimov finally testifies that &#8220;in the summer of 1934, in
Kamenev&#8217;s apartment in Moscow a meeting took place which was attended
by Kamenev, Zinoviev, Evdokimov, Sokolnikov, Ter-Vaganian, Reingold and
Bakaev. It was decided at this meeting to speed up the assassination of
Kirov.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus it turns out that dozens of terrorists&#8212;the number just of
those mentioned above adds up to 24&#8212;chatted for many months about
terror, travelled to terrorist meetings, had terrorist conferences,
etc., etc. They talked in every direction about it; all their friends
and acquaintances knew they were preparing Kirov&#8217;s murder; the only
ones not to know ... were the GPU. And when the GPU, finally made some
arrests after Kirov&#8217;s assassination, it was not able to extract any
information from them. After nearly two months of investigation of the
Kirov case, with the presence, we repeat, among the terrorists of an
agent (or agents) of the GPU and three trials, the GPU, in spite of
everything, still has no suspicion of the &#8220;terrorist activity&#8221; of
Zinoviev, Kamenev and others. It seems that the affair is taking place
on the moon and not in the USSR, which is completely ensnared in the
nets of the omnipotent GPU.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="40%">
<br>
<p class="fst">All this uproar and all this improbable &#8220;terrorist&#8221;
turmoil is raised around Kirov. Why then Kirov? Let us admit for an
instant that Zinoviev and Kamenev were really terrorists. Why would
they have needed to assassinate Kirov? Zinoviev and Kamenev were too
intelligent not to understand that the assassination of Kirov,
absolutely a third-rate figure, immediately replaced by another
Kirov-Zhdanov, could not &#8220;bring them close to power.&#8221; However, in the
words of the verdict, they were hoping for one thing only&#8212;to obtain
power by terrorist means!</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="40%">

<br>
<p class="fst">Let us also note the following: Zinoviev, says
Vyshinsky, hurried up Kirov&#8217;s assassination and the &#8220;desire to out-do
the terrorist-Trotskyists was not the least of his motives,&#8221; and at
another point: &#8220;Zinoviev declared that for them it was a &#8217;question of
honor&#8217; to accomplish their criminal desire (Kirov&#8217;s assassination)
faster than the Trotskyists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bakaev, for his part, declared before the court: &#8220;Zinoviev said that
the Trotskyists, following Trotsky&#8217;s orders, had undertaken the
organization of Stalin&#8217;s assassination and that we (that is, the
Zinovievists) must take the initiative for Stalin&#8217;s assassination into
our own hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Zinoviev had wanted thus to cover up<a id="a21" href="#n21"
name="a21" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[21]</span></a> his participation and that
of his friends in the terrorist acts, he ought to have been very
pleased that the &#8220;Trotskyists&#8221; were taking upon themselves all the
risks and that by doing so, the Zinovievists, all the while keeping out
of danger, would be able, afterwards, to reap the fruits of victory.</p>
<p>Here there is something clearly absurd: either Zinoviev wants to
cover up his participation in the terrorist acts, or he gives these
acts the character of a political demonstration (it is we, the
Zinovievists, and not the Trotskyists, who ...). But not both at the
same time!</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="40%">
<br>
<p class="fst">There is no doubt that if one tenth of that which the
defendants were accused of were true, they would have been tried and
shot at least two years ago.</p>
<p><em>Kirov&#8217;s assassination was the act of a few desperate Komsomols
from Leningrad, without any connection whatsoever with any central
terrorist organization (none existed). Neither Zinoviev, nor Kamenev,
nor any other of the old Bolsheviks had anything to do with Kirov&#8217;s
assassination</em>.</p>
