<h4>On the Moscow Trials</h4>

<br />
 

<h1>TWO TRIALS<br />
(January 1935-August 1936)</h1>

<br />
 

<hr class="base" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p class="fst">The Moscow trial actually was, and in any case had to
be, a <em>revision</em> of the first trial of January 15-16, 1935, in
which Zinoviev, Kamenev, Evdokimov, Bakaev and others were sentenced to
long years of imprisonment. The verdict of the January 1935 trials said
that &#8220;the inquiry had not been able to establish the facts which would
provide the basis for directly charging the members of the &#8216;Moscow
Center&#8217; with having given their assent to the organization of the
terrorist act directed against Comrade Kirov or of having given any
instructions on this subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>These &#8220;facts&#8221; were supposedly now established. Hence the new trial.
Such is the official version. The &#8220;case&#8221; of Zinoviev and the others is
being reconsidered.</p>

<p>One might have thought that the trial would have to proceed from the
evidence of the first trial, from its entire &#8220;structure,&#8221; enlarging and
completing what had &#8220;not been established&#8221; in the past, openly
correcting, without forgetting to explain the reasons, the &#8220;error&#8221; of
the first trial.</p>
<p>Nothing of the sort! The trial does not even attempt to establish
the continuity&#8212;it would have been wasted effort!&#8212;between the first
and second trials, proceeding from the evidence of the first trial,
etc. It simply casts it aside as useless rubbish, thus exposing the
first trial as a machination of the police, which was necessary then,
but not now. It is extremely instructive to compare the trials. It
unmasks the whole lie of the Stalinist judicial &#8220;constructions.&#8221;</p>
<h4>The &#8220;Moscow Center&#8221; and the &#8220;Unified Center&#8221;</h4>
<p class="fst">At the first trial, the entire indictment hinged on the
so-called &#8220;Moscow Center&#8221; (Zinovievists) whose members were, according
to the prosecution: <em>Sharov, Kuklin, Gertik, Fedorov, Gorshenin,
Zinoviev, Kamenev, Evdokimov and Bakaev</em>, that is, exclusively
Zinovievists. Not one word was mentioned in the case about
&#8220;Trotskyists,&#8221; not only the real ones, but even those who capitulated,
such as Smirnov and Mrachkovsky (pseudo-Trotskyists).</p>
<p>At the present trial the Moscow Center has been almost completely
forgotten and the prosecution is constructed exclusively upon the
activity of the so-called &#8220;Unified Center&#8221; (of an altogether different
composition). At the first trial, this Unified Center was never
mentioned at all, for the simple reason that ... the GPU had not yet
succeeded in inventing it.</p>
<p>Neither the court, nor the prosecutor makes any attempt to clarify
what were the political and organizational relationships between the
so-called Moscow <a id="a22" href="#n22" name="a22" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[22]</span></a>
Center and the Unified Center. However this question ought to have been
of great interest to the prosecution, all the more so since the first
center was joined by a number of people who were not in the second and
a few, such as Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bakaev and Evdokimov, belonged to
both centers.</p>

<p>According to the prosecutor&#8217;s explanation, Zinoviev, Kamenev and
others&#8212;19 defendants in all&#8212;(to whom the 14 shot in the Nikolaev
case must be added) simply hid the existence of the Unified Center in
December 1934, and January 1935, while acknowledging everything else
that was demanded of them. Inconceivable! Zinoviev, Kamenev and the
others had spared neither themselves nor those near them, but for some
reason concealed the role of the &#8220;Trotskyists,&#8221; in particular, for whom
they had never harbored any especially tender feelings and the
implication of whom at that time might have really eased the fate of
Zinoviev and Kamenev, because the main blow of the GPU was obviously
aimed at Trotskyism.</p>
<h4>The Nineteen and the Four</h4>
<p class="fst">At the first trial of Zinoviev and others, <em>19 people</em>
were sentenced. Here is the list: 1. Zinoviev, ten years in prison as
the &#8220;principal organizer and leader of the Moscow Center&#8221;; 2. Gertik,
A.N.; 3. Kuklin, A.S.; and 4. Sakhov, B.N.&#8212;as &#8220;the most active
participants,&#8221; ten years each in prison; 5. Sharov, Y.V.; 6. Evdokimov,
G.E.; 7. Bakaev, I.P.; 8. Gorshenin, I.S. and 9. Tsarkov, A.N.&#8212;eight
years in prison. 10. Fedorov, G.V.; 11. Herzberg, A.V.; 12. Hessen,
S.M.; 13. Tarasov, I.I.; 14. Perimov, A.V.; 15. Anishev, A.I. and 16.
Faivilovich, L.Y.&#8212;six years each. 17. Kamenev, L.B.; 18. Bashkirov,
A.S. and 19. Brave, B.L.&#8212;(as &#8220;less active participants&#8221;) to five
years each in prison.</p>
<p>In connection with this case, 49 people were condemned to internment
in a concentration camp for four to five years, including Zalutsky,
Vardin, and others, and 29 people were sentenced to exile for two to
five years. In total, 97 people, former leaders of the former Zinoviev
Opposition.</p>
<p>Of the <em>19</em> convicted in the first trial, one finds in the
present trial, chosen with the utmost arbitrariness, only <em>four</em>.
Why were the 15 others not called, even if only as witnesses? What has
become of these 15 men? Why were only four implicated and why precisely

<em>these four?</em> Let us recall once more: the verdict cites, among
the most &#8220;active,&#8221; next to Zinoviev, <em>Gertik, Kuklin, and Sakhov</em>,
(10 years in an isolator <a id="a23" href="#n23" name="a23" target="_blank" ><span
class="note">[23]</span></a>), whereas Evdokimov and Bakaev had been
placed in the category of people who were less active and Kamenev in
the category of the least active (&#8220;only&#8221; five years in an isolator).</p>
<p>It now turns out that Kamenev, along with Zinoviev, Bakaev and
Evdokimov, was one of the principal leaders. On the other hand, <em>Gertik,
Kuklin</em> and several others, although mentioned several times in the
present trial as leading terrorists, are not on the defendants&#8217; bench!
Many among the &#8220;19&#8221; are not even mentioned in the new case. One must
suppose that as far as they were concerned, what took place in 1935 was
a judicial error. It was necessary either to implicate them or to
rehabilitate them, in any case to call them as witnesses.</p>
<p>At first 19 old Bolsheviks are sentenced to long prison terms for
taking part, although &#8220;it is not established,&#8221; in Kirov&#8217;s
assassination, then four of them, at Stalin&#8217;s choice, are implicated in
a new trial and shot. The fate of the others remains unknown. And there
was, in spite of everything, a juridical scoundrel (the English lawyer
Pritt) who had the effrontery to characterize the &#8220;procedure&#8221; of this
trial as an &#8220;example for the whole world!&#8221;</p>
<p>The four Zinovievists arbitrarily included in the trial Zinoviev,
Kamenev, Evdokimov and Bakaev&#8212;were obviously not chosen in the
interests of justice, but for political and police reasons. Stalin
needed Zinoviev and Kamenev to give this trial its full political
significance. Bakaev and Evdokimov were, most likely, those whom it was
possible to break and without whom the implication of Zinoviev and
Kamenev by themselves would have been difficult. The fact that Kuklin
and Gertik, above all, were not included in this trial can only be
explained, so it seems, by the fact that it was <em>impossible to
break them</em>. For this reason they suited Stalin very poorly, even
as witnesses, in this &#8220;exemplary&#8221; trial. It also cannot be excluded
that certain of them constitute a Stalinist reserve in case of new
trials.</p>

<h4>The Price of the Confessions</h4>
<p>At the Moscow trial, no document, no material proof, (Olberg&#8217;s
Honduras passport cannot be taken seriously) was introduced, no witness
who was not directly implicated in the case was called. The last trial,
just like the first one in 1935, was constructed <em>exclusively on
the confessions</em> (full of lies) of the accused themselves, who were
at the same time the (false) witnesses of the prosecution. Four of
them, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Evdokimov and Bakaev had already made
depositions at the first trial. Let us compare them:</p>

<br>
<p class="fst">After having heaped upon themselves the slander that
they bore political responsibility for Kirov&#8217;s assassination in 1935,
Zinoviev and the others began to yield to Stalin&#8217;s demands and in 1936
piled on the still more monstrous slander of having assassinated Kirov
and prepared other attempts. These men lied both in 1935 and in 1936.
But their lie of 1935&#8212;the self-acknowledgement of the &#8220;political
responsibility&#8221; for Kirov&#8217;s assassination&#8212;is nothing in comparison
with the frightful lie of 1936, the character of which is so tortured
and forced! This &#8220;yes, yes&#8221; repeated at each question by the
prosecutor, doesn&#8217;t that alone reveal that all these confessions are a
lie? Vyshinsky himself qualifies the testimony of the accused as
&#8220;deceit, lies, ... concealment,&#8221; unworthy of &#8220;the slightest confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>We ask: Of what value is the testimony of accused men who &#8220;have lied
previously as they are lying now!&#8221; ... (Prosecutor Vyshinsky)? And of
what value is this trial based <em>exclusively</em> on this testimony,
that is, on &#8220;deceit, lies ... concealment&#8221;?</p>
<h4>The &#8220;Restoration of Capitalism&#8221; or the &#8220;Thirst for Personal Power&#8221;?</h4>
<p class="fst">In connection with the first trial, Zinoviev and Kamenev
had been accused of supporting the return to capitalism, &#8220;capitalist
restoration.&#8221; It is with this refrain that the Soviet newspapers of
that period (the beginning of 1935) persecuted Zinoviev and Kamenev.</p>
<p>If one could not&#8212;then&#8212;establish the nature of the activity of
Zinoviev and Kamenev (terror), at least their purpose had been clearly
established: the <em>re-establishment of capitalism</em>.</p>

<p>At the second trial, the &#8220;restoration of capitalism&#8221; was completely
forgotten. A new version was given: &#8220;... It is irrefutably established
that the only motive for the organization of the Trotskyist-Zinovievist
block was the attempt to seize power at any cost,&#8221; (<em>The Indictment</em>).
The prosecutor repeated it dozens of times: &#8220;For power, power at any
price, the thirst for personal power, that is the entire ideology of
this gang.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sentence is passed, the accused are condemned and shot for using
terror while striving for personal power. And suddenly, several weeks
after this trial, Stalin gives the order to return to the first
version, evidently considering it more &#8220;propitious.&#8221; <strong>Pravda</strong>
(September 12) publishes a thunderous article according to which the
defendants &#8220;... attempted to hide the true purpose of their struggle.
They gave the version that they had no program. In tact, their program
did exist. It was the program of the destruction of socialism and the
reestablishment of capitalism.&#8221; And now the entire &#8220;critical review&#8221;
takes this direction. One of the most important questions&#8212;the motive
of the accused&#8212;is revised by a number of newspaper articles,
completely ignoring all that was said before the court.</p>
<p>When Stalin needs to prove that the defendants are people without
principles, he declares that they have no program and that there is
only the &#8220;thirst for power.&#8221; When he must prove their
&#8220;counterrevolutionary character,&#8221; he announces without embarrassment
that they were not seeking power for its own sake, but the
reestablishment of capitalism. What unceremonious behavior a decade of
uncontrolled power has taught these people!</p>
<h4>The End of the Legend of the Consul</h4>
<p class="fst">By implicating the Zinoviev group in Kirov&#8217;s
assassination in 1935, Stalin wanted above all to strike a blow at
&#8220;Trotskyism&#8221; through this group. This was his principal aim. At the
same time, the attempt was to directly associate the name of Trotsky
with the Nikolaev affair.</p>
<p>On-the twentieth day (!) of interrogation (December 20, 1934)
Nikolaev finally indicated that an anonymous <em>consul</em>, whom he
frequently visited, &#8220;had said that he could establish a link with
Trotsky if I would deliver a letter from the group to Trotsky.&#8221; And
that is all.</p>

<p>As we can see, the initiative for this proposition came from the
anonymous consul; furthermore, the prosecution and the court at
Nikolaev&#8217;s trial did not even judge it necessary to make clear if any
letter had been written and transmitted to Trotsky, if Trotsky had
responded, etc. The GPU preferred not to go into these details, rightly
fearing that they would compromise themselves and discredit their
amalgam.</p>
<p>On December 29, 1934, <strong>Le Temps</strong> announced that
&#8220;foreign circles in Moscow ... are lost in conjectures over the
nationality of this diplomat.&#8221; On December 30, the telegraph agency
announced that &#8220;a conference of the consuls was held, at which it was
decided ... to demand of the Soviet authorities that they publicly name
the suspected consul.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stalin was thus forced on January 2, 1935 to name the consul. &#8220;The
foreign consul mentioned in the indictment in the case concerning
Kirov&#8217;s assassination is the Latvian consul, M. Bissinieks.&#8221; And the
next day, January 3, Tass announced that the consul who was mentioned
had been &#8220;recalled by his government.&#8221;</p>
<p>The consul didn&#8217;t feel it necessary to deny anything or to give any
information. He didn&#8217;t even feel it necessary to indicate why he had
needed a letter from the terrorist Nikolaev to Trotsky. He no doubt had
serious reasons not only for covering up the amalgam of the GPU, but
even for participating in it.</p>
<p>In Moscow, people quickly understood that the amalgam with the
consul had not been successful and that it was better to be silent
about it. Thus it was with all the more insistence that Moscow ordered
its French lackeys to raise a storm against Trotsky in order,
particularly, to create police difficulties for him in France where he
was then living. (What did not succeed in France at that time, has just
succeeded in Norway.) With still unsurpassed gall, Duclos <a id="a24"
href="#n24" name="a24" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[24]</span></a> wrote in <strong>L&#8217;Humanit&eacute;</strong>

(December 29, 1934): &#8220;It is <em>proven</em> (where? when? how?) that
between the assassin Nikolaev and his associates, Trotsky and the
diplomatic representative of an imperialist power (Latvia!) there
existed ties (??) which make it possible to establish Trotsky&#8217;s
responsibility for Kirov&#8217;s assassination.&#8221; &#8220;The consul,&#8221; continues <em>L&#8217;Humanit&eacute;</em>,
&#8220;served as a link between Trotsky and the group of assassins in
Leningrad.&#8221;</p>
<p>The consul served&#8212;in 1935&#8212;as the <em>sole</em> &#8220;basis&#8221; for
accusing Trotsky of participating in Kirov&#8217;s assassination. &#8220;Trotsky&#8217;s
hands are red with the blood of a proletarian leader (Kirov)!&#8221; howled <strong>L&#8217;Humanit&eacute;</strong>.
The proof? The consul!</p>
<p>At the Moscow trial, however, this consul was purely and simply
forgotten. He, who had been the &#8220;link,&#8221; who had proved that &#8220;a
connection did exist&#8221; between Trotsky and Nikolaev, etc.,&#8212;and
suddenly not a word, not a single word! The unsuccessful amalgam was
casually tossed onto the garbage heap and ... replaced by another.</p>
<p>Can anyone compromise himself more? Whose confidence can these men
lay claim to when they expose themselves as slanderers and falsifiers?!</p>

We are sure that the Moscow (Zinovievist) center never existed on the
face of the earth. Bound by long years of mutual effort, people met,
conversed, criticized ... and that&#8217;s all. Vyshinsky announced, for
example, that &#8220;Kamenev said (in January 1935) that he did not know that
there had been a &#8216;Moscow Center&#8217; ... He (Kamenev) says that in so far
(?) as this center existed) and this is proven (???), then he answers
for it&#8221;! (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>

<em>Jacques Duclos:</em> Born in 1896. After war service in which he
was wounded, he joined the (French) Communist Party after the Tours
Congress and rapidly became a leading figure. Elected deputy in 1926,
he acquired a reputation as an orator and an accomplished
parliamentarian. Too volatile to become party leader, he performed as
second string to Thorez and was unfalteringly faithful to the dictates
of Stalin. Trotsky regarded him as a GPU agent. During the occupation,
he went underground and directed the party&#8217;s activities while Thorez
was in Moscow. Has produced lengthy memoirs which deform the history of
the period and excuse Stalinist policies.</p>
