<h4>On the Moscow Trials</h4>

<br />
 

<h1>AFTER THE TRIAL</h1>

<br />
 
<hr class="base" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p class="fst">The Moscow trial is not ended, it continues in new
forms. The business of &#8220;terror&#8221; is conducted at full speed. Dozens,
hundreds of people arrested in connection with the trial of the old
Bolsheviks fill the prisons of the USSR. The repressive machine works
for the time being without failure.</p>
<p>People are arrested because they had a Trotskyist relative, because
ten years ago they expressed some Oppositionist thought. Arrests take
place in Moscow, the Ukraine, in Turkestan, everywhere. Writers,
economists, journalists and military men are arrested; no one is
spared. Bukharin, the editor of <em>Izvestia</em>, mints in the
newspaper which he edits resolutions demanding his head! The ink on the
new Stalinist Constitution was not yet dry, when one of its principal
editors&#8212;Radek&#8212;was handed over for punishment to another of its
editors&#8212;Vyshinsky. After elaborating the &#8220;most democratic
constitution in the world,&#8221; its authors send one another to the
guillotine. The same day that Radek clamored in the columns of <em>Izvestia</em>
for the shooting of the defendants and recalled his services as an
informer (in the Blumkin affair) in order to appease Stalin, his name
was mentioned at the trial and he was declared a &#8220;terrorist.&#8221; You only
had to turn the page of the newspaper!</p>

<p>Piatakov is imprisoned by the GPU for being guilty of the same
crimes for which, the day before his arrest, he &#8220;demanded&#8221; a merciless
punishment for the other defendants. Ordzhonikidze&#8217;s deputy is found
guilty of terrorism, that is, he had planned ... to assassinate his
immediate superior. Sokolnikov and Serebriakov, Uglanov and Putna are
in prison. Having already broken from any opposition many years ago,
they had become docile functionaries of Stalin. This did not help! Even
them people an in some respect dangerous for Stalin. Or, rather, then
is some ether terrible danger which threatens him and he hopes to ward
it off by striking at these men, and getting rid of them. Linked by
their past to the revolution, of which Stalin is the gravedigger, they
must disturb him by their very existence. And if Stalin, after several
years of preparation and hesitation, has now decided on bloody
repression, this shows that along the road of the liquidation of the
revolution he is preparing something new, something which cannot be
compared with what he has already done. His blow against the former
revolutionaries, his blow struck against the Left, leaves no doubt but
that his path is heading to the right, sharply to the right.</p>
<p>In the Moscow trial, those dragged to trial are the most notable
representatives of Bolshevism, as we have already shown. Remember that
19 members of the Central Committee alone and eight members of the
Politburo were mentioned! True, Rykov and Bukharin have been
&#8220;rehabilitated&#8221; <a id="a73" href="#n73" name="a73" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[73]</span></a>
after a three-week investigation. But how were they rehabilitated? &#8220;The
investigation has not established the judicial grounds which make
Bukharin and Rykov legally responsible.&#8221; How well we know this wretched
formula! It repeats word for word the first &#8220;rehabilitation&#8221; of
Zinoviev. In using this truly Stalinist formula, the &#8220;father of the
people&#8221; keeps his hands free for future infamies. &#8220;Grounds&#8221; can always
be found. It will only take a short time before we learn that the
Unified Center was nothing in comparison to the &#8220;Bukharin-Rykov
Center,&#8221; the existence of which was hidden by those who were shot. We
will also learn that Bukharin personally went to Leningrad to organize
Kirov&#8217;s assassination, etc., etc. The fact that the names of Bukharin
and Rykov were mentioned at the trial is a &#8220;warning&#8221; from Stalin: you
are in my hands, I only have to say the word and you&#8217;re finished. In
the language of the penal code, this &#8220;method&#8221; is called extortion (in
its most odious form: life or death).</p>
<p>The death of Tomsky, <a id="a74" href="#n74" name="a74" target="_blank" ><span
class="note">[74]</span></a> whose suicide made a very strong
impression on the country, had a definite effect on the temporary
easing of Rykov and Bukharin&#8217;s fate. This suicide forced the usurper
who had gone too far to reduce the pressure. Accused of taking part in
terror, Tomsky understood that there was no way out of the Stalinist
trap. As a revolutionary and a Bolshevik, Tomsky preferred a voluntary
death rather than suffer the Stalinist ignominies, rather than spit on
himself, rather than drag through the mud all that he had fought for
for decades. Doesn&#8217;t this fact alone, the suicide of one of the heads
of the party, show what a hopeless quagmire Stalin has driven the
revolution into?</p>
<p>Stalin took revenge on Tomsky in the Stalinist way. After having
half-condemned and half-rehabilitated Rykov and Bukharin, he has not
said a word about Tomsky. But how indeed could Stalin have
rehabilitated his memory? That would have meant admitting the calumny
over the still-fresh grave of one of the leaders of the party and the
most capable Bolshevik to come out of the Russian working class.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="40%">
<br>

<p class="fst">It is not difficult to imagine the nightmarish
atmosphere which reigns in the USSR today. No one is sure of tomorrow,
least of all the old Bolsheviks. Yesterday&#8217;s experienced and
responsible leaders are without any reason declared terrorists tomorrow
and thrown into the teeth of the repressive machine. The old Bolsheviks
among those who distinguished themselves in some way in the past can
only anxiously ask themselves: who&#8217;s next in line? <a id="a75"
href="#n75" name="a75" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[75]</span></a></p>
<p>Only the &#8220;non-party Bolsheviks&#8221; and certain &#8220;leading figures&#8221; feel
at ease. These upstart bureaucrats have neither prison nor the fight
for revolution in their past, in fact they have <em>no past at all</em>.
And that is why their <em>future</em> is so much more secure.</p>
<p>Just as the bureaucracy as a whole has freed itself of any
dependence on the workers, so inside the bureaucracy the GPU takes on
an increasingly autonomous character. Independent, not only of the
masses, but also nearly independent of the bureaucracy itself, <em>the
GPU is Stalin&#8217;s personal instrument</em>. Of course, it protects the
positions of the bureaucracy as a privileged social layer, but its
first task is to safeguard the personal position of Stalin and his
absolutism, to defend him against the bureaucracy itself, if
circumstances demand it. The Bonapartist nature of Stalinism shows
itself most clearly through the role of the GPU. In order to guarantee
his monopoly on power, Stalin relentlessly strengthened the role of the
GPU&#8212;the major instrument of this power. Since it has achieved unheard
of power, when it is called on to fight against the dangers which
threaten Stalin, the GPU itself begins to be a danger to him. It is not
without concern that Stalin must consider the GPU. It depends <em>only</em>
upon the &#8220;leader&#8221; but the &#8220;leader&#8221; depends no less on it. And if the
GPU wanted another leader? It is from this point of view, it seems,
that one must consider the removal of Yagoda. He had been head of the
GPU for too long. He had assumed too much power and gathered too many
threads into his hands. Even if Yagoda did not threaten Stalin <em>yet</em>,
it was reasonable, nevertheless, to remove him as a preventive measure.
Less to worry about. Yezhov, the new head of the GPU, is that much
better suited because he&#8217;s a new man, &#8220;inexperienced.&#8221; (In the past,
Yagoda also showed sympathy for the right.) The Moscow trial was,
moreover, a good pretext for removing Yagoda. The truly &#8220;saboteur&#8217;s&#8221;
handling of this case required a scapegoat, and not just from among the
lower ranks. To shake up the talentless investigative agents, mired in
routine, Stalin removed Yagoda, thus giving the others a lesson.
Neither rank nor &#8220;General Commissar of Security&#8221; nor the large star on
his collar could save him from a transfer to the Post Office. What then
can the other Yagodas, at lower levels hope for? Shooting some, shaking
up others, Stalin only reinforces the state of general uncertainty,
anxiety and discontent.</p>

<p>We are certainly headed toward a new trial (or trials)! Its outlines
can begin to be discerned even now. The slanderous accusation of
&#8220;terrorism&#8221; must be supplemented by the accusation of a &#8220;military plot&#8221;
and of &#8220;espionage.&#8221; A number of symptoms tell of how the new trial will
be built around these accusations. It is enough to read the lead
article in <em>Pravda</em> on October 8. It leaves no doubt as to
Stalin&#8217;s plans for the near future.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Trotskyists&#8221; are spies and saboteurs; this is what is repeated
dozens of times. Along these lines, public opinion is now being
prepared. What is more, Pravda openly informs its readers about the
course of the new investigation of the Stalinist Inquisition, when it
says that the &#8220;<em>frank confessions</em> of a number of the most
prominent (?) Trotskyists (?) show&#8221; that they &#8220;carried out the work of
spies and saboteurs in the Soviet Union not only out of fear, but out
of conscience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here again we have before us the &#8220;frank confessions&#8221; which are so
well known and so discredited.</p>
<p>(Stalin will find it that much easier to repeat with the new
defendants that which he was able to do with the 16 already shot, since
they were arrested before or during the trial. Cut off from the outside
world, they know nothing of the end of Zinoviev, Kamenev and others.)</p>
<p>The arrests of the military men, Putna, Schmidt, Kuzmichev, and
others also reveal the nature of the new case. They are to help Stalin
accuse the Left Opposition of a &#8220;military plot,&#8221; and by their
execution, he will have the possibility of calling the military caste
&#8220;to order.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is also possible that Stalin will place the new trial on the
widest possible foundation. Moscow&#8217;s lead article says, for example,
that the &#8220;counterrevolutionary sabotage of the Trotskyists in our
industry, in the factories and the mines, on the railroads, in
construction, in agriculture is now proven and <em>already admitted by
a whole series of the most prominent Trotskyists</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>There can be doubt. We are on the eve of a new trial. Our duty is to
warn Western public opinion. No illusions concerning the Borgia of
Moscow, armed with modern technology!</p>
<p><em>Stalin needs Trotsky&#8217;s head, that&#8217;s his main goal</em>. To
achieve it, he will begin the most extreme, even more ignominious
trials. If any one was still able to entertain any illusions on this
subject, the Moscow trial must have dispelled them completely. Stalin
hates Trotsky as the living representative of the ideas and traditions
of the October Revolution, toward which is turned all that has remained
revolutionary in the Soviet Union. To get Trotsky&#8217;s head, Stalin
conducts the most abominable intrigues in Norway and prepares further
intrigues through the League of Nations. With his trials he prepares
the ground for demanding Trotsky&#8217;s extradition. It is not in vain that
the Soviet government showed such a great interest, in connection with
the assassination of the King of Yugoslavia, toward the problem of
international police collaboration against terrorists. At that time, it
might have seemed rather surprising. Today, after the Moscow
&#8220;terrorist&#8221; trial, Stalin&#8217;s interest in the struggle against terrorists
on an &#8220;international scale&#8221; takes on much sharper meaning.<a id="a76"
href="#n76" name="a76" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[76]</span></a></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="40%">
<br>
<p class="fst">The methods of Stalin and the GPU are carried over more
and more into the international arena. Trotsky is imprisoned. The
Spanish Trotskyists are accused of &#8220;attempts&#8221; against the leaders of
the Popular Front (although every Spanish worker-militiaman knows that
the Bolshevik-Leninists fight with them in the same ranks at the
front). The Polish Trotskyists are agents of the secret police. The
German Trotskyists are Gestapo agents. Such is Stalin&#8217;s <em>only</em>
method of fighting.</p>
<p>It is not at all a question of Trotskyists, it is a question of
Stalin&#8217;s methods which threaten to poison the entire moral atmosphere
of the world workers movement. <em>Today</em> these methods are used
predominantly in the fight against &#8220;Trotskyism,&#8221; <em>tomorrow</em>

they will be directed against other currents in the working class. We
have already seen how the leaders of the Second International were
accused of being accomplices of the Gestapo agents because of their
telegram during the Moscow trial. Stalin wants to reduce the political
disagreements of the workers movement to the formula: GPU or Gestapo.
Whoever is not with the GPU is a Gestapo agent. Regardless of party
affiliation the world workers movement must repulse this attack in the
sharpest and most decisive manner. The workers movement cannot tolerate
in its midst the methods of <em>political gangsterism</em>. The danger
is all the more serious since Stalin has placed a powerful government
apparatus at the service of this political gangsterism.</p>
<p>The Moscow slanders and the Moscow assassinations affect not only
the interests of the Soviet Union, but deal an irreparable blow not
only to all the gains of the October Revolution, but also to the world
workers&#8217; movement. Woe to him, who doesn&#8217;t know how to protect himself
from the fatal venom of Stalinism. It is his moral self-preservation
which is at stake.</p>
<p>It is a lie and a slander to pretend that Lenin and Trotsky, the
Bolsheviks during the epoch of the upsurge of the Russian Revolution,
used the same methods. This is a slander against the October
Revolution, the greatest proletarian revolution in history. Could it
have been by means of filth and slanders that the Russian working class
conquered in 1917? That it won the Civil War? Political morality is not
an abstraction. It depends entirely on politics itself. The poisoned
weapon of slander was organically alien to the revolutionary politics
of the insurgent masses of 1917. This weapon is taken from the arsenal
of reaction. But it is only with the help of this weapon&#8212;lies,
slander, and the assassination of revolutionaries&#8212;that Stalinism,
which has usurped power from the Soviet proletariat, is able to hold on.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="40%">
<br>
<p class="fst">The Moscow trial has once again shown just how much the
bureaucracy has exhausted its progressive role as defender of the
conquests of the October Revolution. It has become an obstacle <em>to
the further development of the USSR</em>, because the interests of this
development in social, cultural and political relations have come into
irreconcilable contradiction with the caste interests of the
bureaucracy. <em>In order to open the way for the development of the
USSR toward socialism, the bureaucracy mast he liquidated</em>.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, Stalin said: &#8220;these cadres (of the
bureaucracy) can never be removed except by civil war.&#8221; Thus he openly
placed the bureaucracy above the working class, above the party. For
ten years, nevertheless, the Bolshevik-Leninists defended the political
line of reforming the Soviet state. But by its politics and by its
methods, the bureaucracy has finally taken from the Soviet proletariat
the possibility of reforming the state by legal means.</p>

<p>The International Conference of the IVth International in July 1936
&#8212; before the trial&#8212;said in its theses: &#8220;If the return of the USSR to
capitalism requires a <em>social counterrevolution</em>, then the
advance toward socialism inevitably requires a <em>political revolution</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Moscow trial has confirmed with new force the correctness of
this perspective.</p>
<p>The Soviet proletariat can advance to socialism only through the
rebirth and expansion of Soviet democracy, through the legalization of
Soviet parties, above all, the party of revolutionary Bolshevism. But
the rebirth of Soviet democracy is only possible with the overthrow of
the bureaucracy. And only the forces of the revolutionary working
masses can overthrow the bureaucracy!</p>

Reingold, Kamenev and Zinoviev testified that these men knew about the
terrorist activity and had found a &#8220;common language&#8221; with them. The
&#8220;rehabilitation&#8221; of Bukharin and Rykov indirectly gives an unequivocal
evaluation of the defendants&#8217; confessions. (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>

<p class="note"><a id="n74" href="#a74" name="n74" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[74]</span></a>
M.P. Tomsky (born in 1880), a lithographer, joined the revolutionary
movement in 1904; in 1905 was a deputy of the Revel Soviet; was
arrested for the first time in 1906, deported and escaped from exile. A
delegate to the London Congress (1907); arrested once again toward the
end of 1907, Tomsky remained in prison with only a short break until
April 1909. After a few months of illegal party work, in December 1909,
Tomsky was again arrested and, after spending two years in jail before
being brought to trial, was sentenced to five years imprisonment. In
1916, after almost seven years imprisonment, Tomsky left prison for
eternal exile in Siberia. After the October Revolution, Tomsky was for
many years an authoritative leader of the Soviet trade unions; a member
of the Central Committee and the Politburo.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n75" href="#a75" name="n75" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[75]</span></a>
This atmosphere could not help but affect even the top bosses. A
characteristic fact: on the lists compiled by Stalin of leaders whom
the terrorists supposedly intended to kill, them appeared not only
leaders of the first rank, but even the Zhdanovs, Kossiors, and
Postyshevs. <em>But Molotov was not listed</em>. In affairs of this
type, Stalin does nothing by accident. Isn&#8217;t he preparing the ground
for a future &#8220;reevaluation&#8221; of Molotov? If the terrorists did not want
to &#8220;murder&#8221; Molotov, doesn&#8217;t this man that they &#8220;were counting on&#8221; him?
And from here, it is only one step to the indictment of Molotov himself
in terror. But, of course, this lies well ahead in the distant future.</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n76" href="#a76" name="n76" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[76]</span></a>
It is highly possible that one of the candidates for the new
Berman-Yurins or Olbergs of the impending trial will be A. Senin, whom
we mentioned in the chapter on <em>Copenhagen</em>. True, Senin had
already broken with the Opposition by 1932, and broken in a
particularly loathsome way by directing many insinuations in the press
against the Left Opposition. True, Senin then went to the USSR and told
the GPU everything he could about the life of the international left,
and, since that time&#8212;four years&#8212;has been with the Stalinists. But
did similar circumstances hinder the bringing to trial of Lurie or
Olberg or even Fritz David or Berman-Yurin, who never were in the
Opposition? Another possible candidate is a certain Mill-Obin-Okun. He
became a member of the administrative secretariat of the Left
Opposition, but because he was completely unfit, he was dismissed. Soon
after this, Mill joined the Stalinists and went to the USSR. At that
time, a note appeared in the <strong>Bulletin</strong>, No.31,
November 1932, exposing Mill&#8217;s behavior.</p>
