<h1>WHAT REALLY DID EXIST?</h1>

<br />
 
<hr class="base" noshade="noshade" size="1">
<p class="fst">After having crushed the Left Opposition in 1927-1928,
Stalin, who had until then denied the possibility of industrialization,
of collectivization, and of the planned economy in general, made a left
turn. The new Stalinist economic policy, extremely contradictory,
chaotic and carried out with purely bureaucratic methods, was formed
from scraps taken from the platform of the Left Opposition. With all
the more bitterness Stalin directed the repression against the bearers
of this platform. The Stalinist left turn (plus the strengthening of
repression) brought disorder in 1929 into the ranks of the Left
Opposition. The recently begun industrialization and collectivization
opened up new possibilities and new perspectives. Under these
conditions, many Oppositionists were inclined to he lenient toward the
regime, which had become increasingly bureaucratic. They were swept
away by a wave of capitulations. Among them were Radek, Preobrazhensky,
I.N. Smirnov, Mrachkovsky, Ter-Vaganian, Dreitzer, and others.</p>
<p>The following years (1930-1932) were the years of uncontrolled
bureaucratic management of the economy by the the Stalinist leaders who
rapidly led the country into a very serious economic and political
crisis. This crisis took particularly sharp forms in 1932. The
administrative abolition of classes in the countryside and the forced
&#8220;complete&#8221; collectivization had radically disrupted agriculture. In the
Soviet economy the disproportions had taken on extraordinary
dimensions: between industry and agriculture, and within industry; a
catastrophic level of quality, an absence of consumer products,
inflation, the complete disruption of transportation. The material
situation of the masses worsened continuously, malnutrition turned into
actual starvation. Millions of new workers lacked housing and vegetated
in barracks, often without light, in the cold, in filth. Across the
country there spread an epidemic of spotted fever such as had not been
seen since the Civil War. A general fatigue and discontent began to
come to light. The workers had recourse more and more frequently to
strikes, in Ivanovo-Voznesensk there were large upheavals of workers.
The kolkhozniks defended their harvest and their goods against the
non-collectivized peasants with arms in hand. In the Caucasus and the
Kuban a small civil war raged. The demoralization which was growing
ever stronger in the party, the discontent and the distrust of the
leadership also filtered into the apparatus. One could hear everywhere,
among the old Bolsheviks, the workers, the young Komsomols, that Stalin
was leading the country to ruin.</p>

<p>This was the situation which surrounded the former leaders of the
Left Opposition who had split from it. After having capitulated at a
different time, they had all sincerely tried, at least at first, to
adapt themselves to the Stalinist apparatus, hoping to take part in the
struggle for industrialization, the struggle against the kulak. But the
sharp economic and political crisis moved them away from the Stalinist
apparatus. Half involuntarily, certain oppositionist feelings were born
in them, the need to speak among themselves, to criticize the Stalinist
policies. Thus in 1932, one could observe a certain, though rather
weak, awakening of the groups which at one time had capitulated before
Stalin; the group of Zinoviev and Kamenev. the group of old left
Stalinists&#8212;Lominadze-Shatskin-Sten (those who were called the
&#8220;leftists&#8221;); of Smirnov and his friends, and also of some rightists,
Riutin, Slepkov, and others. But this &#8220;awakening&#8221; must not be
exaggerated. For the majority, it had a purely domestic character,
never going further than &#8220;heart-to-heart&#8221; talks and dreams about how
good it would be to have other politics and another leadership. Most
likely, the men from the different circles sought out a personal coming
together, ties with each other. The most audacious perhaps said that it
would be good to form a &#8220;bloc.&#8221; But probably it was not even taken that
far. Hence Stalin now (four years later!) constructs a &#8220;bloc&#8221; and even
a &#8220;Unified Center.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
<em>Of course the Russian Bolshevik-Leninists didn&#8217;t enter into my kind
or a bloc with a single of one these groups</em>. <a id="a41"
href="#n41" name="a41" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[41]</span></a> All these
groups had at one time or another capitulated to Stalin and for this
alone they were utterly opposed to the Bolshevik-Leninists, who
considered and continue to consider capitulation as one of the greatest
crimes against communism and the interests of the working class. On
this question, the Left Opposition took a particularly intransigent
attitude. In the eyes of the Bolshevik-Leninists, these groups and men
did not and could not have any political or moral authority.</p>
<p>The Left Opposition attached a primarily symptomatic importance to
the awakening of these groups of &#8220;party liberals.&#8221; as they were called
amongst themselves. Of course, this could serve as a point of departure
for Zinoviev, Kamenev, Smirnov and others to return to the old banner
of the Bolshevik- Leninists&#8212;<em>it could</em>, but it was <em>nothing</em>
of the sort.</p>
<p>Stalin, the GPU and the Central Control Commission did not remain
ignorant of this state of mind among the old Oppositionists. This state
of mind, be it said in passing, had at that time seized the majority of
the party. At the beginning of October 1932, <em>Zinoviev and Kamenev
were expelled from the party</em>, in a common list with prominent
rightists, Uglanov (former secretary of the Central Committee and the
Moscow Committee of the party), Riutin (member of the Central Committee
and leader of the Moscow organization), Slepkov, Maretsky (young
rightist theoreticians, students of Bukharin), and others. <a id="a42"
href="#n42" name="a42" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[42]</span></a> Riutin had
in fact written a long document critical of the Stalinist policies and
the Stalinist regime, including, it seems, a very rude portrayal of
Stalin personally (&#8220;evil genius of the party.&#8221; etc.). Zinoviev and
Kamenev were accused of the following: &#8220;Knowing that
counterrevolutionary documents were widespread, they had preferred,
rather than denounce them, to discuss this document and thus to show
themselves to be direct accomplices of an anti-party
counterrevolutionary group.&#8221; <a id="a43" href="#n43" name="a43" target="_blank" ><span
class="note">[43]</span></a> (<strong>Pravda</strong>, 1932). Just for
failing to make this &#8220;denunciation,&#8221; there was no other accusation &#8212;
Zinoviev and Kamenev were expelled from the party and exiled from
Moscow. The announcement of their expulsions mentioned not a word about
any kind of political activity by Zinoviev and Kamenev&#8212;there was none.</p>

<p>Such was the <em>first</em> version, in any case a plausible one,
of the &#8220;activity&#8221; of Zinoviev and Kamenev in 1932. The <em>second</em>
version (in 1934) already spoke of a &#8220;Moscow Center,&#8221; of having
&#8220;excited terrorist tendencies,&#8221; etc. The <em>third</em> version (the
trial m August 1936) contains the Unified Center, terrorism, and
Kirov&#8217;s assassination! The further the facts go into the past, the more
shamelessly Stalin falsifies them!</p>
<p>Soon the news arrived from Moscow about the arrest of a number of
well-known former Oppositionists, old Bolsheviks: I.N. Smirnov,
Preobrazhensky, Ufimtsev, Mrachkovsky, Ter-Vaganian, and others. <a
id="a44" href="#n44" name="a44" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[44]</span></a></p>
<p>We have written above that the exile of Zinoviev, Kamenev and others
might have become the starting point for their return to the
Bolshevik-Leninists, but that it was nothing of the sort. Already by
the <em>spring of 1933 Zinoviev and Kamenev had capitulated once again</em>,
and in a much more humiliating manner than before, by glorifying
Stalin, etc. They were returned to Moscow. Here is how Trotsky then
evaluated the new capitulation in the press: &#8220;Acknowledge Stalin&#8217;s
genius ... and Zinoviev and Kamenev &#8216;acknowledged&#8217; it, that is, they
have finally reached the bottom ...&#8221; &#8220;Like Gogol&#8217;s hero, Stalin is
collecting dead souls ...&#8221; (May 23, 1933, <strong>Bulletin of the
Opposition</strong>, No.35.)</p>

<p>How far away these words are from a &#8220;bloc&#8221; or common &#8220;Unified
Center&#8221;! In the eyes of a politically honest man this one quotation
annihilates all the Stalinist slanders concerning the bloc of Trotsky
and Zinoviev, which lay at the basis of this trial.</p>
<p>The new capitulation of Zinoviev and Kamenev was closely linked to
the improvement of the USSR&#8217;s domestic situation. In 1933 the crisis
was softening, the Oppositionist feelings were lessening. The
capitulationist groups which had almost come to life once again
returned to passivity. In 1934 these tendencies became decisively
stronger.</p>
<p>At the trial, we are presented with a very different picture. As
long as a sharp crisis and a general discontent reigned (1932-1933),
the terrorists did not show any particular activity. But precisely at
the moment when (in 1934) the country was &#8220;coming out of its
difficulties, the triumph of the policy of the Central Committee of the
All-Union Communist Party (Bolshevik) provoked a new outburst of
animosity and hatred against the leadership of the party ...&#8221;
(Kamenev&#8217;s testimony).</p>
<p>This whole story is a very stupid fabrication. It was necessary to
help lay the foundation for the charge of having assassinated Kirov (in
1934.)</p>
<p>After granting amnesty to Zinoviev, Kamenev and others, Stalin did
not give them any confidence. They were not entrusted with work of even
the slightest importance. They were kept far away from politics. Since
that time, that is, since the spring of 1933, Zinoviev, Kamenev and all
the others who had capitulated, passed completely into political
non-existence. Morally, they were broken. They no longer lived, they
vegetated. The revolver fired by Nikolaev upset this situation.
Zinoviev, Kamenev and others were brutally &#8220;recalled&#8221; by Stalin to
political life, &#8220;not for their own sake, but for the sake of Stalin,&#8221;
as victims of the Bonapartist bosses. Old Marxists, who had tied their
whole lives to the party of the working class and the movement of
masses, were accused of having participated in &#8220;terrorism.&#8221;</p>

If the &#8220;bloc&#8221; between the Left Opposition and various groups which
capitulated to Stalin existed, how can it be explained that nothing
about this significant fact appeared in the press, especially in the
Stalinist press. The Left Opposition was always an intransigent
opponent of behind-the-scenes combinations and agreements. For it, the
question of a bloc could only consist of an open political act in full
view of the masses, based on its political platform. The history of the
13-year struggle of the Left Opposition is proof of that.</p>

<p>No doubt the politically intransigent attitude toward capitulation
did not exclude individual personal meetings or exchanges of
information&#8212;but nothing more. (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n42" href="#a42" name="n42" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[42]</span></a>
The very expulsion of Zinoviev and Kamenev together with the rightists
was a typical Stalinist, i.e., Thermidorian amalgam. (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n43" href="#a43" name="n43" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[43]</span></a>
This means Riutin and his friends. (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>
<p class="note"><a id="n44" href="#a44" name="n44" target="_blank" ><span class="note">[44]</span></a>

Here is how the Moscow correspondent of the <strong>Bulletin</strong>,
a Bolshevik-Leninist, described these events: &#8220;The numerous arrests
among those who had left the opposition (in Moscow alone around 150
people were arrested and exiled), were explained as a prophylactic
measure. Although many of those who had left were passive, they were
not trusted. Stalin considers it necessary to get rid of someone before
he is able to think.&#8221; (<strong>Bulletin of the Opposition</strong>,
No.35, July 1933) (<em>L.S.</em>)</p>
