<p class="fst">The kleig lights glaring in the convention hall in Philadelphia
 illuminated the hypocrisy of big-party conventions. The nominating
 convention is supposed to be the democratic way for the whole party
 to choose its candidates. Nothing was clearer at Philadelphia than
 that the goings-on in the hall were window-dressing, the real
 business being conducted well to the back of the store or, we might
 say, under the counter.</P>
<P><I>The facts that the reception given Dewey was cool, that Taft
 aroused no more enthusiasm though a bit more noise, that Stassen&rsquo;s
 streamlined stunt brought out more real feeling, these facts meant
 nothing at all. Once it was established that Dewey and his aides had
 in the past few years succeeded in getting their hands on the
 switches that control the Republican machine, there was nothing left
 to do but to trade with the man at the controls. His stock in trade
 is jobs, jobs in the Republican campaign that he can hand out as
 nominee and the juicier jobs he can bestow if elected president.</I></P>
<P>Already Representative Scott of Philadelphia was rewarded with the
 chairmanship of the Republican National Committee, in recognition of
 the Pennsylvania delegation going over to Dewey. Newspapermen and
 radio commentators are bristling with predictions of other pay-offs.
 Senator Martin, who was the first to relinquish his candidacy in
 favor of Dewey may be placed as Secretary of Defense, if Dewey wins;
 Senator Taft has been promised a seat on the United States Supreme
 Court; and the president of the Chase National Bank is slated for
 Secretary of the Treasury, just to assure Wall Street that it made a
 good investment in Dewey.</P>
<P>But what am I saying? Didn&rsquo;t Dewey himself deny, in his
 acceptance speech, that he made any deals!</P>
<H4>*</H4>
<p class="fst">One of the most maddening aspects of the convention speeches was
 the assumption that a Republican victory in November is in the cards.
 Some of this was, of course, for psychological effect, but not all.
 Unfortunately the political history of the country gives the
 Republicans good ground for assuming the victory will be theirs. It
 is the custom for the mass of the voters, when they want a change, to
 flip the coin of capitalist politics from one side to the other. The
 statisticians also point out that in the past century or so, six out
 of the seven times that congressional control has been voted to the
 other party, the next presidential election also turned the old party
 out of the administration.</P>
<P>The people in this country who have the responsibility to change
 this deadening routine, have done nothing about it. They have left it
 to the Stalinists to offer their stooge, the Wallace third party, as
 the treacherous alternative. The labor movement has itself to thank
 for Republican cocksureness.</P>
<H4>*</H4>
<p class="fst">What of the fact that the Republican-controlled eightieth Congress
 elected in 1946 made a record of attacks on labor&rsquo;s position,
 of serious infringements on democratic rights, of irresponsibility
 toward the urgent needs for price control, housing, health insurance,
 civil liberties?</P>
<P>Well now, Dewey was not in the Congress, was he? Neither was
 Warren, was he? So these good men and true are not responsible, are
 they? On the other hand, what really can be expected of a Republican
 Congress hampered by a Democratic administration? So will run the
 campaign bunk of the Republican Party.</P>
<P><I>While Truman has capitalized on the Republican record in
 Congress and the Democratic campaigners will squeeze it dry for their
 own purposes, the person who follows political events remembers that
 after the end of the war the Democratic seventy-ninth Congress made
 no haste to put into law the &ldquo;new democracy&rdquo; for which
 the war was naturally fought. Also, President Truman was careful to
 wait until a Republican Congress was in before pressing his much
 advertised social measures, for not passing which he now upbraids the
 Republicans.</I></P>
<P>The political finagling of both major parties and their failure to
 solve vital problems for the people because of loyalty to capitalist
 profits and interests, have left a mark on the people. With strong,
 independent working class leadership in the form of an independent
 labor party, the working people can be broken of their tweedledee and
 tweedledum political habit.</P>
<H4>*</H4>
<p class="fst">If the mood of the convention speeches was emphatically
 optimistic, the theme of most of them was anti- New Deal. This was
 beating a dead horse merely for the sake of venting anger. For many
 Republican politicians and their big business backers nurture such a
 blind hatred for anything favoring labor or advocating government
 intervention in pressing social problems that they cannot see that
 the New Deal has been dealt and that the Democratic Party is no
 longer a New Deal party.</P>
<P><I>The tragic thing is that the leaders of organized labor had
 hitched their wagon to the New Deal, though it was apparent from the
 start that it was simply a political technique for pulling American
 capitalism out of a severe crisis by making pacifying gestures toward
 the working people who were restless under the depression. The
 Democratic Party has made it amply clear that the Now Deal was no
 star, only an empty balloon.</I></P>
<P>The Republicans, in jumping on the poor, deflated thing, are
 actually showing their sentiments toward labor and the working people
 who had mistakenly looked to the New Deal for permanent progress.</P>
<H4>*</H4>
<p class="fst">All politicians are very mindful of the fact that women cast a
 great percentage of all the votes. The efficient Mr. Dewey and his
 aides are all out to create good will among the fair sex.</P>
<P><I>One of the most disgusting spectacles at the convention, as
 reported in the press, was the bargain counter set up by the Dewey
 managers to win friends among the women gathered in Philadelphia. The
 get-something-for-nothing craze created by business advertising in
 radio quiz and other programs had a field day at the Dewey
 headquarters.</I></P>
<P>Great baskets of articles contributed by business supporters of
 Dewey were carried about by ushers, and women delved into them to
 grab something to take home. Then, every thousandth woman to enter
 the headquarters was hailed as a queen and presented with something
 really big from the bargain counter. The bedlam was worse than a sale
 of nylons in Klein&rsquo;s on New York&rsquo;s Union Square.
 Everybody came in and went out several times not only to make a
 second and third grab into a basket, but to try to be a thousandth
 woman to enter the headquarters.</P>
<P>On this high level did Dewey appeal for support.</P>
<H4>*</H4>
<p class="fst">However, Mr. Dewey is a man who leaves no stone unturned. He also
 appeals to the better nature in womankind by promising to include a
 woman in his cabinet.</P>
<P><I>Perhaps this appeal to the better nature is more insulting even
 than the other, because at the bargain counter the woman did carry
 away some material thing. But putting a Republican machine woman in
 the Republican cabinet will be as important to working women and
 women in general as putting a machine man in the same place, no more
 and no less.</I></P>
<P>Mr. Dewey expects that women will not know or will not take to
 heart that the Republican platform sidetracks the issue of the cost
 of living, has pebbles in its mouth on the housing question, spouts
 only generalities on women&rsquo;s rights, civil rights and so on.
 What a compliment to the women of America!</P>
