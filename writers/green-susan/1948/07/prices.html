<p class="fst">Join any group of housewives and chances are you&rsquo;ll find
 them talking about prices. Next to the worry as to whether the Berlin
 situation will explode into war, they worry about prices. And they
 talk in a rather hopeless and fatalistic way, expecting to dig into
 savings if they have any, and to cut down their buying. They know
 from experience what such people as write for the financial page of
 the <B>New York Herald Tribune</B> learn from statistics, that the
 housewife &ldquo;will find the going tough and, consequently, the
 borrowings from banks, insurance companies and other institutions
 will increase. Funds will be withdrawn from savings and savings bonds
 will be cashed in order to make both ends meet.&rdquo;</P>
<P><I>Prices are now the highest in all history and arc scheduled to
 rise in the months to come. But the Republican Party platform adopted
 a few weeks ago, absolutely sidetracked the question of stopping
 inflation. Women are buying much less meat because it costs twice
 what it did in 1946 when OPA ended. They can&#8217;t even buy sufficient
 quantities of fruits and green vegetables because, even with very
 ample summer supplies, prices are marked up unreasonably. Mothers
 wonder why the monopolistic Borden and Sheffield companies were
 permitted to boost milk prices again. But the Republican politicians
 are quite complacent about these worries of every family.</I></P>
<P>Their approach to the question, if they can be said to have one,
 is that an economical administration, such as Mr. Dewey promises to
 give, will do wonders toward reducing taxes; this in turn will enable
 corporations to lower prices (oh, yeah!) and it will also give people
 (what people?) more money to spend; presto, the whole difficulty
 disappears. Who said price control is necessary?<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>More Rises Coming</H4>
<p class="fst">While politicians evade the issue, it becomes more intense. The
 <B>United States News &amp; World Report</B> of July 9 predicts that
 things are going to cost more as the year wears on. The rise will be
 slow but sure.</P>
<P><I>The cost of living is expected to increase six or seven per
 cent more in the year ahead. Meat will be even more expensive, so
 will milk and butter. Household equipment is being upped. Gas,
 electricity and telephone may cost more because &ldquo;utility costs
 cannot always resist the trend upward.&rdquo; The cost of building
 inches upward, and rents are going higher. Such is the dire outlook
 presented in the latest issue of the <B>United States News</B>.</I></P>
<P>In Philadelphia this week, but not in time for <B>Labor Action</B>
 to report on it in this issue, the Democratic Party will also adopt
 its campaign platform. President Truman had demanded of the
 Republican Congress that it pass a law giving him power to institute
 price control, rationing, allocations and priorities, as and when the
 president should see fit. It is easy to see how inadequate such a law
 would be even if passed, for it would create no immediate price
 controls. And it would not be the plight of the housewife that would
 determine whether controls are necessary or not, but those having the
 inside track to the president would make up his mind. Whether the
 Democratic convention will go farther than Truman or as far remains
 to be seen. Anyway, who any longer takes seriously a campaign
 platform plank of the capitalist parties?<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Fear Lurks Behind Boom</H4>
<p class="fst">Commentators sought to bring a ray of hope into the picture when
 the Department of Agriculture reported expectation of a bumper crop
 of grains in the 1948 harvest. The corn crop will be fifteen per cent
 over the average of the last ten years, the wheat harvest will be the
 second highest in all history, oats will be 18 per cent more
 plentiful than the average of the 1936&ndash;45 period. In Europe
 also the harvest of wheat and rye is expected to yield 25 per cent
 more than last year. This should mean more and cheaper bread and
 grain products, as well as cheaper meat, dairy products, eggs and
 poultry because of abundant fodder. However, after the first
 optimistic comments, the consensus seems to be that the factors
 making for increased costs outweigh those that might tend to reduce
 prices, with the conclusion, as stated above, that the overall cost
 of living is going up some more.</P>
<P><I>Those comparatively few workers who have escalator clauses in
 their contracts, including the recent General Motors contract, will
 get a little more toward meeting the higher prices. However, the
 great body of working people will feel the squeeze in full force. The
 so-called third round of wage increases was not sufficient to put the
 workers abreast of price increases already in effect, to say nothing
 of those still to come.</I></P>
<P>And right behind the workers&rsquo; worry over meeting living
 costs, lurks the fear of what will happen to them when the inflation
 bubble bursts and the bust comes. What will happen to them without a
 guaranteed annual wage?</P>
<P>These working class problems can be taken up honestly,
 forthrightly and adequately only by a working class party. As time
 goes on it becomes ever clearer that the working people must organize
 their own independent labor party &ndash; not a Wallace-Stalinist
 party &ndash; to contest for power against the capitalist parties.
 This is what housewives should be talking about in connection with
 the runaway cost of living and the insecurity of life in general.</P>
