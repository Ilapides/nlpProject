<br />
<p class="fst">When Thomas E. Dewey was campaigning for the Republican primaries
 in Oregon, considered decisive as between him and Stassen, there
 wasn&rsquo;t any cheap politician&rsquo;s trick he wouldn&rsquo;t
 resort to. <B>Time Magazine</B> reported:</p>
 <p class="quoteb">&ldquo;Tom Dewey was
 running like an alderman who wanted to meet all of Oregon&rsquo;s
 630,000 voters personally,&rdquo; He had a hectic time &ldquo;pumping
 hands, signing autographs, ripping off ten speeches a day. He peered
 at cows in Corvallis, at logging operations along the Umpoqua River.
 He accepted a salmon at Oregon City, signed his name in blood for the
 local booster club at Coos Bay, paraded with an organization called
 the Cavemen at Grants Pass and, at their bidding, munched on a large
 bone.&rdquo;</P>
<P class="fst">How distasteful these ridiculous activities must have been to the
 precise soul of the aspirant to the presidency of the United States
 can only be guessed at. For, as reports have it, he is addicted to
 deliberateness, has a passion for neatness so that his desk never has
 disorderly papers on it; he craves well-sharpened pencils of the same
 length. He dislikes the telephone and keeps it in a drawer of his
 desk. He favors conservative clothes, thinks it undignified to be
 photographed in his shirt sleeves or with his mouth open because of
 poorly spaced front teeth. In private life he relaxes on his farm at
 Pawling, New York, plays golf and with his sons soft ball, and sings
 duets with his wife.</P>
<P>This is the personality of the man, but only part of it. He seems
 also to have a consuming ambition overriding all else. So while the
 repulsive antics of campaigning placed a ghastly, frozen smile on his
 face, he was fulfilling an inner urge to become &ldquo;a great man.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Dewey was not born rich. His father was the local postmaster in
 Owosso, Mich., where son Thomas was born in 1902. The son sang in
 choirs, managed a magazine route, worked in his father&rsquo;s print
 shop when the latter took over the local paper. From the University
 of Michigan he came to New York to study music, impelled by having
 won a singing contest. On good advice, however, he abandoned singing
 for law &ndash; and politics, apparently with the conviction that
 anybody, but anybody, can become president of the United States,
 provided he makes the right connections. That he did make the right
 connections is evidenced by the fact that for each of his important
 campaigns he had as his campaign treasurer none other than Winthrop
 W. Aldrich, brother-in-law of John D. Rockefeller and chairman of the
 powerful Chase National Bank.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Big and Little People Not Quite the Same</H4>
<p class="fst">Dewey got his break into big-time politics when another one of his
 good connections, George Z. Medalie, recommended him for the job of
 special prosecutor to clean out the gangsters of New York. With his
 calculating shrewdness, he must have realized that this was his big
 chance, for he worked with such efficiency and relentlessness that he
 piled up an imposing list of convictions.</P>
<P>Among those who fell under his axe were Waxey Gordon for income
 tax evasions, Lucky Luciano for the prostitution racket, and bigger
 fry like Jimmy Hines for Tammany graft and stock-exchange president
 Richard Whitney for grand larceny. Thus Dewey became a hero of a
 kind, with the reputation of doing a job against the little and the
 big racketeer alike.</P>
<P>That the little and the big people in society do not, however,
 occupy the same place in Thomas E. Dewey&rsquo;s scheme of things &ndash;
 to say nothing of the little people taking precedence over the big &ndash;
 is apparent in what he says and does. For instance, in a speech he
 made on foreign affairs early this year he said: &ldquo;Last November
 I urged that a plan be formulated in straightforward fashion to be
 run by a government authority under bi-partisan directors and with
 the ablest businessmen in the country in charge. I know of only one
 way to do a job well, either public or private, and that is to get
 the ablest people we have to run it, give them full authority and
 hold them strictly accountable for results.&rdquo; Nary a word about
 labor! To Dewey the intertwining of government and business is what
 makes the world go round. He does not even give the lip service to
 labor that other politicians give. His advisers may have Candidate
 Dewey correct this omission of lip service, but the true man has
 revealed himself.</P>
<P><I>Not only in words, though, has he revealed his bias toward the
 big people. His record as governor shows it plainly. He is praised by
 his friends and has impressed many by his efficiency, his economy,
 his administrative ability, and much is made of the fact that he has
 piled up many hundred million dollars in the New York State treasury.
 The question is for whom has he piled it up? Teachers and parents&rsquo;
 organizations were agitating for a $103,000,000 appropriation for
 state education. It will be recalled that there were several &ldquo;Marches
 on Albany&rdquo; and one group took over the Senate Chamber for a
 while. Dewey is reported to have decided: &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll
 let &rsquo;em sit this one out&rdquo; &ndash; implying that &ldquo;
 &lsquo;em&rdquo; were only Communists anyway. When it came down to
 brass lacks, he refused to allow more than $30,000,000 for state
 education.</I></P>
<P>However, while battling against adequate aid to the public
 schools, he allowed industry credit rebates from the unemployment
 insurance fund reserve which are expected to amount to $165,000,000
 this year and which a year ago amounted to $152,000,000. The CIO was
 indignant, called these rebates a colossal grab, and contrasted them
 with the shabby allotments made for people&rsquo;s needs.</P>
<P>We must give more attention to Dewey&rsquo;s record as governor.
 His supporters promise: &ldquo;What the United States would get with
 Dewey in Washington would be a projection on
 a national scale of what the State of New York has been getting
 with Dewey in Albany.&rdquo; Dewey in Albany has been the scheming
 politician with his heart set on Washington. Is he a liberal? Is he a
 conservative? He is neither or both, as his cautious mind tells him
 will net him the best political capital. For example, he is given
 credit for a State FEPC law. Having put his wetted finger out in the
 wind, he found it dried in the heat of Negro resentment; therefore
 the FEPC, for Negro votes. However, in practise, has he, for
 instance, raised his voice against the Metropolitan Life Insurance
 Company&rsquo;s policy of discrimination in its housing projects?
 Again, what kind of a liberal is it who would father a law making
 striking by government employees illegal, with drastic penalties for
 violations?</P>
<P><I>On the housing issue, Charles Abrams, <B>New York Post</B>
 writer on the question, says:</I></P>
<p class="quoteb"><i>&ldquo;What prompted the usually shrewd Mr. Dewey to
 abandon housing this year was his feeling that he could pick up the
 support of the anti-housing forces while also wooing the vet and the
 pro-housing groups on the basis of his past housing record. But this
 record will look sadly blighted in the light of 1948.&rdquo;</I></p>
<p class="fst"><I>What is Dewey&rsquo;s past housing record? He has been cagey
 enough to take credit for the state rent control bill which, however,
 is absolutely ineffective as long as there is any kind of federal
 rent control law at all. Again, his provision for homeless GIs has
 been described as &ldquo;a handful of huts.&rdquo;</I></P>
<P>Dewey&rsquo;s great achievement as governor is his tax cutting
 record. He has reduced income taxes 40 per cent and business taxes 25
 per cent. Together, business and businessmen derive the greatest
 benefit. He stubbornly refused to raise taxes and lose his prestige
 among business people. This year, to meet the state budget, he
 ordered an across-the-board slash in expenditures of nine per cent
 by all his department heads. How many state employees became jobless
 is not advertised &ndash; but taxes were not increased.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Expediency, Caginess Plus Calculation</H4>
<p class="fst">Now let us look at Dewey as he rushed about the country
 campaigning for delegates to vote for him in the convention. John
 Gunther in <B>Inside U.S.A.</B> said of Dewey&rsquo;s preconvention
 behavior back in 1944 that it was marked by &ldquo;canniness born in
 him, plus an overlay of caginess born of experience ... He avoided
 going out on a limb and taking positions on issues unnecessarily.
 Every step was carefully calculated and prepared.&rdquo; In 1948
 Dewey had to give the appearance of being a little more definite.</P>
<P><I>Perhaps what is best known about Dewey, because of the
 publicity given to his controversy with Stassen on the issue, is what
 to do with Communists. Dewey is against the Mundt bill, he said:</I></P>
<p class="quoteb"><i>&ldquo;I am unalterably, wholeheartedly and
 unswervingly against any scheme to write laws outlawing people
 because of their religious, political or social or economic ideas.&rdquo;</I></p>
<p class="fst"><I>But, says Dewey:</I></P>
<p class="quoteb"><i>&ldquo;The Congressional Committee on Un-American
 Activities has been widely criticized in our country because it has
 been called a red-baiting committee. As a matter of fact, it has been
 doing a fine, solid, good American job for a great many months. It
 has done a fine job of exposing Communists and bringing them out in
 the open, where they belong.&rdquo;</I></p>
<p class="fst"><I>That&rsquo;s just what Mundt bill advocates say that bill will
 do. Mr. Dewey doesn&rsquo;t speak from conviction but from
 expediency, so he cannot be consistent.</I></P>
<P>Commentators have hailed the nomination of Dewey as the growth, of
 the Republican Party from isolationism to internationalism. Dewey&rsquo;s
 internationalism is of recent vintage. He was opposed to lend-lease,
 direly predicting that it &ldquo;would bring an end to free
 government in the United States and would abolish the Congress for
 all practical purposes.&rdquo; He did not declare himself on the
 Marshall Plan until months of debate and discussion showed him which
 way the wind was blowing.</P>
<P><I>But as far as the working people arc concerned, the
 internationalism of the capitalist class today means only a more
 enlightened approach toward American imperialist interests than
 isolationism. In the final count, capitalist internationalism is
 preparing the groupings for World War III.</I></P>
<P>A humorous touch must be added here on Dewey&rsquo;s
 internationalism. Robert G. Spivack, writing in <B>The Nation</B> of
 May 8, 1948, describes some of Dewey&rsquo;s posturing thus:</P>
<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;When visitors came to his hotel suite in New York
 or the executive mansion in Albany, Dewey would light a cigarette,
 sit back, appear to relax, and casually reminisce about his
 &lsquo;memorable&rsquo; nine-hour conversation with Winston
 Churchill, or his delightful &lsquo;chat&rsquo; with Premier de&nbsp;Gasperi, or the &lsquo;insight into conditions&rsquo; he got from the
 Austrian Consul General. The idea he wished to convey was that these
 men and other foreign dignitaries already regarded him as the next
 President. Naturally, he implied they were keeping him abreast of
 affairs so that when he took over he could quickly establish liaison
 with the heads of other powers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="fst">Such are Dewey&rsquo;s qualifications in foreign affairs &ndash;
 of course, there are his advisers who know more about machinations
 abroad.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Stands for Nothing but His Ambition</H4>
<p class="fst">What is Dewey&rsquo;s stand on questions disturbing labor? But why
 should he commit himself at this point? In 1944, halfway through the
 campaign, Dewey became aware that it was unwise to attack the New
 Deal because of popular sentiment for it. Quite unabashed he suddenly
 switched and came out for nearly everything that Roosevelt was
 identified with. So there is plenty of time for Dewey to take &ldquo;a
 stand&rdquo; on labor in the 1948 campaign.</P>
<P><I>However, <B>Time Magazine</B>, issue of April 5, 1948, lists
 among Dewey&rsquo;s recent switches his change on labor legislation
 from being pro-Wagner Act to becoming pro-Taft-Hartley Act. As for
 other vital problems, entirely muffed in the Republican platform,
 Dewey has given himself some leeway, for he approved the platform &ldquo;as
 I interpret it.&rdquo;</I></P>
<P>So here is the measure of this man who would be President of this
 nation of some 150,000,000 people in an era of chaos and crisis.
 Roosevelt had a political cult to offer the capitalist class at a
 time of lesser crisis. The man could be identified with his beliefs,
 both of course serving the capitalist class. Dewey stands for nothing
 but his own ambition. He appears to have no convictions at all. But
 he has certain talents for administration in the narrowest sense of
 the word, and above all the talent of having convinced certain
 interests, notably the Rockefeller interests, that he can serve them
 well.</P>
