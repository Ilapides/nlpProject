<p class="fst">Even with all the dark warnings handed out by President Roosevelt and government spokesmen, the average worker does not have a concise idea of how terribly hard this war is going to hit him.</p>

<p>But here comes Colston E. Warne, professor of economics of Elmhurst College and president of the Consumers Union, who translates the dark Warnings into brass tacks:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;<strong>Taxes for 1942,&#8221; declares Professor Warne, &#8220;will reduce Mr. Average American&#8217;s $100 to $60.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p class="fst">In other words, this year &#8211; which is only the beginning of what is to come &#8211; taxes alone will take 40 per cent right off the worker&#8217;s wages.</p>

<p>But this is not the whole disastrous story.</p>

<p class="quoteb"><strong>&#8220;Rising prices,&#8221; further elaborates Professor Warne, &#8220;will reduce the purchasing power of this to $42, compared to 1939.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p class="fst">Actually, then, the worker will divide his wage &#8211; which he will certainly earn by the sweat of his brow &#8211; <strong>42 per cent for himself and 58 per cent for the war.</strong></p>

<p>A $40 a week wage will buy for the worker only $16.80 of the necessities of life. A $30 a week wage will be reduced to $12.60 in purchasing power.</p>

<p>A $20 a week wage will shrink to $8.40 over the counter of the butcher, baker and candlestick maker.</p>

<p><strong>THE LITTLE MAN GETS LITTLER AND LITTLER AND LITTLER.</strong></p>

<p>Professor Warne, being an expert on consumers&#8217; worries, goes right to rock bottom.</p>

<p>Many families, he states, will not be able to buy that basic food &#8211; <strong>MILK.</strong></p>

<p>People who now can afford one precious egg for breakfast, will have to do without it.</p>

<p>Clothes, according to the professor, will be worn not only until [<em>line missing in printed text</em>] honored uniform of poverty, will be worn by the workers who produce all the wealth in the wealthiest nation on earth.</p>

<p>Why should the little man pay this harrowing price for the war &#8211; while the big man gets bigger and bigger on war profits!</p>

<p>Taxes on the workers cut deep into their necessities of life &#8211; food, clothing, shelter. The rising cost of living, on top of this throws the working class back into actual poverty.</p>

<p>But even if every last cent of war profits should be taken for war taxes &#8211; as it should be &#8211; <strong>THE BOSSES WILL STILL BE ABLE TO ENJOY EVERY LUXURY OF LIVING TO WHICH THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED.</strong></p>

<p>The question is: Does democracy mean that the rights of private property get more consideration than the rights of human beings!</p>
