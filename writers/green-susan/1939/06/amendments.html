<p class="fst">In accordance with <em>Notice to Members</em> appearing in the May 23 issue of the <strong>Appeal</strong>, I submit the following points for revising the political resolution also appearing in that issue.</p>

<p class="fst">1. Paragraph 8 should not remain in its present form. It gives the impression that Yankee imperialism is the only brand in Latin America. Latin America has been meat for all the imperialist nations, even though the U.S. grabbed the lion&#8217;s share. Recently the inroads of Nazi Germany in parts of Latin America have been considerable and furthermore have been given wide publicity. We, of course, support the struggle of the Latin American masses against the whole imperialist racket. Our particular concern with U.S. imperialism must not lead us to state our position in such a way as to allow the accusation &#8220;pro-Nazi&#8221; to be made against us by our enemies.</p>

<p class="fst">2. In the section of the resolution <em>The Struggle Against Fascism</em> a new part should be added. It is imperative in the fight against fascism that the unions enter into the struggles of the unemployed. The more solidarity created between the unions and the unemployed the less chance does fascism have to gain the support of the unemployed and use the latter for smashing the unions. We must get this idea over. Our comrades in the unions must work along this line. We must hammer on this idea in the <strong>Appeal</strong> and in special leaflets for distribution at union meetings. This work has to be done by us.</p>
