<p class="fst">To the Editor:</p>

<p class="fst">Starting from the point that the Independent Socialist League proclaims its greatest propaganda task at present is to counter the war preparations with the call for the socialist anti-war camp, with the slogan &ldquo;Neither Washington nor Moscow,&rdquo; I fail to see how the leading article in the issue of April 18 in any way furthers this task. I do not argue whether or not the policy of the United States is to &ldquo;draw blood&rdquo;; whether or not the Atlantic Pact means the &ldquo;cold invasion&rdquo; of Western Europe; whether or not the presence of American troops at the Iron Curtain means war. These points could perhaps be argued. But I do say that in making these points, comrade, you went so completely out of balance as to have written an article any fellow-traveling organ would be delighted to publish. I am absolutely sure that this was not the intention; of course not. It seems to me it was the result of writing on certain angles, without regard to the context of general events.</p>

<p>One of the general events to be borne in mind is that today the Stalinists are waging, all over the world, a so-called peace offensive, and of course they are the injured innocents while the United States is out to &ldquo;draw blood.&rdquo; In the anti-war propaganda of <strong>Labor Action</strong> and the Independent Socialist League we must separate ourselves from this Stalinist &ldquo;peace offensive.&rdquo; The only way in which we can do this is by not losing sight of the fact that, there is another general event, namely, that the Russian troops or Russian-controlled satellite troops have been on the other side of the Iron Curtain since the end of the war, and that there the invasion has bad a little more heat than to permit of the name &ldquo;cold invasion.&rdquo; So I say there is a deplorable lack of balance in an article that starts with a dismissal of Russian aggression, ends with a call for the withdrawal of American troops, and only in passing refers to the justified hatred of the Stalinist tyranny.</p>

<p>It is true, to be sure, that everything cannot be said in one article but enough must be said not to create undesired impressions, enough should be said to make clear our position &ldquo;Neither Washington nor Moscow.&rdquo; I know that every time we write against Stalinism and Moscow imperialism we do not in the same article give equal space to expose Washington imperialism, but I cannot think of one article we have written in the former category which did not also make clear that we were taking our position against Moscow on a socialist basis and therefore could not be mistaken as pro-American. On the other hand, I think the article I criticize could, today, very easily be mistaken for pro-Russian.</p>

<p>I believe with all my heart that if there is any chance of avoiding this Third World War it is by the masses of the people accepting the concept of &ldquo;Neither Washington nor Moscow.&rdquo; This cannot be just an incidental idea, but must be the hammer blow in every article on the war.</p>
