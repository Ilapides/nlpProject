<p class="fst"><strong>Labor is interested in ceilings &#8211; BUT NOT IN CEILINGS ON WAGES!</strong></p>

<p><strong>The workers have an interest in apartments and homes with HIGH CEILINGS and plenty of windows.</strong></p>

<p>But the workers cannot get such basic necessities <strong>when a ceiling is put on wages</strong> and THAT IS WHAT THE BOSS POLITICIANS ARE TALKING ABOUT NOW.</p>

<p>Another kind of ceiling that the workers are definitely concerned about is a CEILING ON PROFITS.</p>

<p><strong>The war has only begun</strong> AND ALREADY THE BOSS PROFITS ARE ASCENDING INTO THE STRATOSPHERE.</p>

<p><strong>Let the Washington big-wigs clip the wings of war profits. WAGES must do SOME SOARING to shorten that long distance between the average worker and the good things of life.</strong></p>

<p>There is a federal law declaring that labor IS NOT a commodity or article of commerce. In fact, a number of state statutes use the same sweet words. <strong>Such laws are so much eyewash.</strong></p>

<p><strong>When the warlords discuss putting ceiling on the prices of steel, oil, cotton wheat and hogs, they include the commodity LABOR.</strong></p>

<p><strong>According to the economic laws of the exploiting capitalist system, LABOR POWER IS A COMMODITY &#8211; without any buts, ands or ifs.</strong></p>

<p>The war-wizards in the Capital talk about put ting ceilings on all prices &#8211; not only on the price of man&#8217;s capacity to labor.</p>

<p>THE WORKERS ARE FROM MISSOURI!</p>

<p><strong>What has Leon Henderson been doing for these many months IF NOT FIXING PRICES?</strong></p>

<p>But the result of all the &#8220;fixing&#8221; is that month by month <strong>the cost of living leaps to new heights.</strong> HENDERSON HIMSELF ADMITS PRICES CLIMBED BY 17 PER CENT ABOVE PRE-WAR LEVELS.</p>

<p><strong>Has the commodity, labor, done as well?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Only in the basic war industries</strong> &#8211; WHERE THE GOVERNMENT AND THE BOSSES WERE COMPELLED BY MILITANT&#183;STRIKES TO PLACATE THE WORKERS &#8211; <strong>have wages gone up to an average</strong> &#8211; NOT OF 17 PER CENT &#8211; BUT A MEAGER 10 PER CENT</p>

<p><strong>Many, hundreds of thousands of workers have received only negligible increases &#8211; MANY HAVE RECEIVED NONE AT ALL SINCE THE WAR BEGAN.</strong></p>

<p>YES, THE WORKERS ARE FROM MISSOURI.</p>

<p><strong>When any &#8220;fixing&#8221; is to be done,</strong> IT ALWAYS TURNS OUT ALL RIGHT FOR THE BOSSES AND NOT SO HOT FOR THE WORKERS.</p>

<p><strong>Nobody could argue that it isn&#8217;t being fixed pretty well for the bosses</strong> &#8211; WHEN THEY CAN REPORT WAR BOOTY ANYWHERE FROM ONE HUNDRED TO THREE THOUSAND PER CENT ABOVE PRE-WAR PICKINGS.</p>

<p>NO, THANK YOU &#8211; NO CEILINGS ON WAGES!</p>

<p>PUT YOUR CEILINGS ON PROFITS, YOU WAR-WIZARDS!</p>

<p>The worker is not exactly tickled pink with his status as a commodity along with hogs, wheat, cotton, oil, steel. He does not think it fun for human beings to be tossed about on the billowing waves of the profit-controlled market.</p>

<p><strong>During the depression, when the bosses were not buying labor power,</strong> WORKERS HAD TO EKE OUT A MISERABLE EXISTENCE ON A SUB-HUMAN LEVEL.</p>

<p><strong>Now, when there is a better seller&#8217;s market for labor power, THE BOSS POLITICIANS WANT TO PUT A CEILING ON WAGES!</strong></p>

<p>The worker is also not exactly tickled pink about the war for the benefit of the exploiting capitalist system &#8211; <strong>that system which puts him in the same economic category as hogs.</strong></p>

<p>But this war between the international bandits &#8211; which the workers hate and do not want to fight &#8211; <strong>has FOR THE TIME BEING undeniably created a better market for labor.</strong> THE WORKERS ARE WISE TO THE SCOUNDRELS WHO WANT TO PUT A CEILING ON WAGES NOW!</p>

<p>Old Lady Nature is not concerned with the fact that under capitalism labor is a commodity. <strong>According to the laws of nature,</strong> THE WORKERS ARE HUMAN BEINGS.</p>

<p>Today the worker&#8217;s family is in good health.</p>

<p>Next month there may be sickness and death. The size of his family increases. His children grow up. Their needs grow up, too. <strong>There are a hundred and one exigencies of human life that require</strong> MORE AND MORE MONEY.</p>

<p><strong>THERE IS NO CEILING ON HUMAN NEEDS!</strong> Human needs must not be lost sight of in the deafening clamor the boss war-makers are raising.</p>

<p><strong>In the coming period of mounting living costs, burdensome taxes, compulsory &#8220;savings,&#8221; increased &#8220;social security payments,&#8221; HUMAN NEEDS WILL BE LOST IN THE SHUFFLE</strong> &#8211; IF THE WORKERS DO NOT KEEP THE RIGHT TO DEMAND AND FIGHT FOR <strong>MORE WAGES!</strong></p>

<p>LET THE CEILINGS BE PUT ON THE ONE HUNDRED TO THREE THOUSAND PER CENT WAR PROFITS!</p>

<p><strong>NO CEILINGS ON WAGES!</strong></p>
