<p class="fst">These days every working-class housewife is plenty hot under the collar. Daily the dollar shrinks in value.</p>

<p>Before you leave the house you figure out what you expect to buy for your money, but when you arrive at the store you find the price once more a lap ahead of you. Right then and there you feel like rolling up your sleeves and fighting against this constant imposition on your right to live.</p>

<p>But here&#8217;s something that will not merely make you hot under the collar. It will burn you.</p>

<p>According to government statistics, the GENERAL average of prices has gone up 14 per cent since the war began &#8211; which is high enough. But the cost of farm products and textile goods &#8211; <strong>the very basic necessities of life</strong> &#8211; is as much as 23 per cent to 27 per cent higher.</p>

<p>Yet these are the very products of which there are unsold quantities &#8220;of unprecedented magnitude&#8221; according to the <strong>New York Times</strong>. The unsold surplus of grain alone would pile up to 600,000,000 bushels &#8211; a veritable mountain of potential food.</p>

<p>While you are biting your lips and paying profiteering prices, GOODS ARE STACKED UP IN THE WAREHOUSES &#8211; UNUSED!</p>

<p><strong>And those things which have gone up most in price are the most plentiful</strong> and SHOULD BE THE CHEAPEST.</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade />
<p class="fst">But the government is against the natural operation of supply and demand.</p>

<p><strong>It pays the corn and cotton kings hundreds of millions of dollars to stack up their surplus stuff in warehouses. And it pegs prices at high levels</strong> TO NET GOOD PROFITS TO THE BLOATED MONOPOLISTS OF THE SOIL AND OF THE FRUITS OF THE SOIL.</p>

<p>Investigations have proved that the poor farmer and the exploited: sharecropper gets next to nothing out of this agricultural policy of the government. THE WORKING CLASS HOUSEWIFE IS PAYING 23 TO 27 PER CENT MORE FOR FOOD AND COTTON GOODS &#8211; SOLELY TO KEEP THE WEALTHY PROFITEERS OF AGRICULTURE IN THE STYLE TO WHICH THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED!</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade />
<p class="fst">You are told that the surpluses are piling up because the <strong>export market</strong> for grain and cotton has been curtailed by the war and by competition from other countries.</p>

<p>You are told that if the huge surpluses accumulated were thrown en the open market, prices would fall so low that <strong>agriculture would be ruined</strong> and <strong>the price structure</strong> of the whole country would be upset.</p>

<p>But why should the working class housewife be concerned about <strong>the export market!</strong> IT IS WHERE THE CAPITALIST SELLS THE GOODS OF WHICH THE WORKERS ARE ROBBED because wages are falling below what the working, class produces.</p>

<p>Why should the working class housewife care about <strong>the export market?</strong> IT IS THE CAUSE OF THE BLOODY WAR NOW RAGING.</p>

<p>As for <strong>the ruin of the corn and cotton kings</strong> by the lowering of prices, the poor farmers, the sharecroppers and the workers have no tears for them or for any other gang of plundering capitalists!</p>

<p>The working-class housewife has no use for export markets, for high price structures, for government policies <strong>generous to the profiteers.</strong> FOR THE WORKING CLASS THESE ARE NO REASONS FOR PAYING 23 AND 27 PER CENT MORE FOR FOOD AND COTTON GOODS.</p>

<p><strong>The workers want an abundance of the products of the land and of the factories!</strong></p>

<p><strong>The bosses of agriculture and industry and the boss-government give the workers CAPITALISTIC REASONS for not letting them have what they need!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Workers&#8217; control of agriculture and industry under a workers&#8217; government</strong> WILL DELIVER THE GOODS!</p>
