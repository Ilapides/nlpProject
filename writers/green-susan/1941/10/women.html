<p class="fst">It so happens that milk makes good bones and good teeth for growing children. It so happens that milk is essential to young and old for good health.</p>

<p>In New York City this indispensable food sells at FOURTEEN CENTS A QUART, representing a FORTY PER CENT INCREASE OVER WHAT IT SOLD FOR WHEN THE WAR BEGAN.</p>

<p>This exorbitant price has compelled the average housewife to cut down on milk consumption. <strong>The children of New York City&#8217;s poor &#8211; of whom THIRTY-THREE PER CENT ARE UNDERNOURISHED, according to the medical records kept by forty-four settlement houses &#8211; will be milk-starved</strong> Young people, adults and aged will be deprived of this diet essential.</p>

<p>Coming down to brass tacks, <strong>this means that war rationing has already begun.</strong> Not by law but by the facts of life. NOT FOR THE RICH, BUT FOR THE POOR.</p>

<p>Nor has the price ceiling for milk been reached. <strong>Predictions are that it will rise to EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY CENTS A QUART.</strong></p>

<p>Leon Henderson boasts that he is keeping down the prices of steel and chemicals. <strong>However, people do not consume steel and chemicals either in the raw or in the form of tanks and poisongas.</strong></p>

<p>The Washington politicians have on their minds such imperialist business as a two-ocean navy and air and chemical supremacy. <strong>The human business of feeding people cannot be left to suchas they.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If the working people arc to save themselves from undermined health that will make them susceptible to devastating epidemics &#8211; AS HAPPENED IN THE LAST WAR &#8211; THEY THEMSELVES MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE PRICE OF FOOD.</strong></p>

<p>WORKING WOMEN OF THE NATION &#8211; BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE &#8211; ORGANIZE YOURSELVES INTO COMMITTEES. ONLY BY MILITANT ACTION CAN YOU COMPEL THE WAR-MAD GOVERNMENT TO STOP FOOD PROFITEERING AT THE EXPENSE OF HUMAN LIFE.</p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade />
<p class="fst">The air and the press are full-up with appeals to women to get into &#8220;defense&#8221; jobs.</p>

<p>A little enlightenment from women who have &#8220;gone and done it&#8221; is timely.</p>

<p>For months now the government has been giving industrial courses to women. Leaflets are distributed high and wide advertising these two-month courses and calling upon women <strong>between theages of 18 and 50</strong> to &#8220;help their country by training for defense jobs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many women fall for that line and also for the prospect of good wages. Many give up jobs they already have to take these two-month courses &#8211; <strong>without pay.</strong></p>

<p>THEN THEY BEGIN TO FIND OUT THINGS THE LEAFLETS DO NOT ADVERTISE.</p>

<p>When the course is over and they get their &#8220;work certificates,&#8221; they register with the State Employment Bureau &#8211; AND WAIT. It is quite usual to <strong>wait two weeks before even being sent out to a job.</strong> When finally they go to a plant, they may have to sit around from four to six hours &#8211; without lunch &#8211; <strong>only to get an application card to fill in. Then they wait some more &#8211; WITHOUT PAY.</strong></p>

<p>It soon becomes clear to these women that employers prefer girls of 18 to 22. If they are over 30 &#8211; in spite of the government leaflets &#8211; <strong>their chance of employment are very, very slim.</strong></p>

<p>If they are either Negroes or Jews, or if their citizenship is derived from their menfolk, <strong>industry is not very anxious to have them.</strong> If they are married, their chances are not as good as if they are single &#8211; <strong>the bosses want women who are so dependent on their jobs that they will stick no matter what the grind.</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Defense&#8221; jobs for women are still very limited. <strong>Many plants will not employ the female of the special at all. If women do get into war industry, they are put on the minimum wage of thirty cents an hour. Mostly they land in the radio factories and get &#8220;SOME CRAPPY JOBS.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>PAY-TRIOTISM DOES NOT WASTE ITS FAVORS ON THE WOMEN WHO HAVE GONE INTO SO-CALLED &#8220;DEFENSE&#8221; JOBS.</p>

<p class="fst">Mary Churchill, you may know, is the daughter of that &#8220;sincere democrat,&#8221; <strong>who, not too long ago, expressed the hope for a British Hitler to save the Empire, if England should be defeated in a war.</strong></p>

<p>This same Mary Churchill has become a member of the working class &#8211; no less! You have doubtless seen her picture &#8211; in the papers or or. the screen &#8211; cleaning windows or scrubbing floors.</p>

<p><strong>The lion puts on the lamb&#8217;s skin to fool the lambs.</strong> WHEN THE RULING CLASS DRESSES UP IN OVERALLS. SCRUBBING PAILS AND BRUSHES, IT IS TO FOOL THE WORKERS.</p>

<p><strong>Everybody is supposed to he working hard and making sacrifices for the SAME CAUSE, don&#8217;t you know!</strong></p>

<p>But &#8212;</p>

<p>WAR BETWEEN THE INTERNATIONAL PLUNDERERS IS NEVER THE CAUSE OF THE WORKING CLASS!</p>

<p class="fst">My clandestine apparatus picked up the following picture and conversation in the exclusive and expensive Rainbow Room at Radio City on the eve of October 1, <strong>the famous day when the new taxes went into effect.</strong></p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Have-have, glamorous in evening attire, are seated t&#234;te-&#224;-t&#234;te, sipping cocktails, beaming with content, well-being and tonsorial splendor.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;You are absolutely ravishing tonight, my dear,&#8221; Mr. Have-have purrs across the table.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Thank you, darling. And you, I noticed, are in remarkably good spirits,&#8221; his wife replied in dulcet tones.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I was getting around to telling you, my dear.&#8221; At this point Mr. Have-have put down his glass to rub his hands in satisfaction. &#8220;I landed that billion-dollar government contract. Congratulate me.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;You darling!&#8221; breathed his wife in ecstasy, pressing his knee under the table. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t do so badly myself today.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;How do you mean, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I picked up this sable wrap at a mere $5,000 today, and saved you $500 in taxes.&#8221;</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;That&#8217;s the girl,&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Have-have, patting her hand approvingly. &#8220;Every penny counts!&#8221;</p>
