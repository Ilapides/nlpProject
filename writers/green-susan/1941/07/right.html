<p class="fst">According to the Gallup poll, 79 PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE WOULD VOTE &#8220;TO STAY OUT OF THE WAR&#8221; &#8211; if a referendum on war takes place.</p>

<p>This is what George Gallup, director of the American Institute of Public Opinion, reports as the latest measurement of anti-war sentiment in this country.</p>

<p><strong>With all the pressure propaganda, with all the false invasion scares, with all the warmongers on the radio, in the movies, in the press, the imperialist war-makers could muster the voting support of only 21 per cent of the people.</strong></p>

<p>Mr. Roosevelt was elected for a third term on the promise to keep the nation out of war. THE OVERWHELMING VOTE HE GOT WAS AN OVERWHELMING VOTE AGAINST WAR.</p>

<p>The platform of the Democratic Party contained an anti-war plank. The vast majority of the American people voted for the candidate of the Democratic Party, who was parading under false colors. IT WAS AN ANTI-WAR VOTE.</p>

<p>THE PLAIN PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY ARE STILL AGAINST GOING TO WAR.</p>

<p>The <em>Kiplinger Letter to Business Men</em> dated June 21 states: &#8220;THE INTERIOR IS CERTAINLY NOT STEAMED UP FOR WAR.&#8221; The &#8220;interior&#8221; is the label Washington gives to the common people of the country.</p>

<p>Hansen W. Baldwin, military expert, states in the <strong>New York Times</strong>: &#8220;THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. MOST OF THE GUYS IN THIS MAN&#8217;S ARMY DON&#8217;T WANT TO FIGHT.&#8221;</p>

<p>The workers, the sharecroppers, the tenant farmers, the neighborhood storekeepers and <strong>their boys in the conscript camps</strong> &#8211; ARE AGAINST THE WAR!</p>

<p>BUT MR. ROOSEVELT PUSHES CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE WAR!</p>

<p><strong>Unknown to the American people, fighting bombers are already operating on the ocean.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Unknown: to the American people, United States troops are already on foreign soil.</strong></p>

<p>WHOSE MANDATE IS ROOSEVELT FOLLOWING IN THESE WAR COMMITMENTS? <strong>Not that of the majority of the American people!</strong></p>

<p>HE IS FOLLOWING THE ORDERS OF THE BOSSES, THE BANKERS, THE WAR PROFITEERS, THE IMPERIALISTS! <strong>He is President for the sixty exploiting families &#8211; not for the masses!</strong></p>

<p>On June 19 Mr. Gallup wrote: <strong>&#8220;If a national referendum were taken today on the question whether the United States should go to war now, there can be little question that it would show a large vote against entering the war.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>THAT IS WHY THE LUDLOW AMENDMENT HAS BEEN BOUND UP IN RED TAPE AND THROWN INTO THE CONGRESSIONAL DARK CLOSET.</p>

<p>The question put by the Gallup poll was very definite, very specific: <strong>&#8220;If you were asked to vote on the question of the United States entering the war against Germany and Italy, how would you vote &#8211; to go into the war or to stay out of the war?&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>TO THIS UNEQUIVOCAL QUESTION 79 PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE WOULD VOTE TO STAY OUT!</p>

<p><strong>That is why troop movements and overseas operations are kept from the American people!</strong> THE PEOPLE DON&#8217;T WANT TO GO TO WAR!</p>

<p><strong>But in Washington the talk is for open entry in July or August.</strong></p>

<p>The fact that Hitler&#8217;s campaign against his erstwhile ally, Russia, to get grain, oil and war materials, means A LONG WAR, does not stop the swivel-chair generalissimos. In Washington. THEY ARE PREPARING FOR A LONG WAR!</p>

<p><strong>The people whom the war-makers force to sweat, to suffer, to bleed, to die, don&#8217;t want to get into the war in July or August &#8211; or any other time.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The people upon whom the unbearable burdens of war fall don&#8217;t want to be involved in this worldwide imperialist blood-letting.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The people are entitled to a referendum on this vital question!</strong></p>

<p>THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY &#8220;NO&#8221; TO THE IMPERIALISTS!</p>

<p>THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAVE THEMSELVES AND THE NATION THEY BUILT WITH LABOR FROM THOSE WHO LUST FOR WORLD POWER!</p>
