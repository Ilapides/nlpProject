<p class="fst"><strong>The National Conference of Trades Councils opening on May 31st
has exceptional importance for the whole labour movement this year.</strong></p>
<p>Over a hundred years ago, it was this body which took the
initiative in bringing the TUC itself into existence. Yet, over the
years, it was relegated to a purely advisory role, carrying little
weight in the decisions made by the trade union movement as a whole.</p>
<p>Only at times of very great crisis has it become clear, as during
the general strike in 1926, that trades councils must play an
indispensable role in mobilising the whole working class by &#8220;hand
or by brain&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the light of the successes and failures of the TUC&#8217;s &#8216;Day
of Action&#8217; on 14 May it has again been shown that this task of
mobilising the working people in the localities almost automatically
falls onto the shoulders of those thousands of delegates who give
their time to the building of trades councils throughout Britain.</p>
<p>Wherever the Day of Action was a success it was because the local
trades council rose to the occasion, taking bold steps in good time
to rally around it all affiliated organisations and the officers and
stewards of those unions.</p>
<p>Without these dedicated efforts, the hesitant and rather unclear
call of the General Council of the TUC would have been as ineffective
as the vile propaganda of the capitalist press has claimed it was.</p>
<p>In the event, in many areas, organised labour was able to put on
demonstrations which in size and spirit have not been seen since 1926.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that resolutions coming before the National
Conference have great importance for all workers in the labour
movement. Unfortunately these resolutions can only have an advisory
character, but they cannot be ignored by the TUC General Council.</p>
<p>They truly reflect a growing desire by thousands of the most
active, enlightened rank and file members of the labour movement for
active resistance to Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s attacks, both on working
class standards of living and hard-won trade union rights.</p>
<p>Some of the resolution to be debated at Conference reveal an
increasing demand that trades councils should become the
all-inclusive &#8220;working-class parliament&#8221; they were originally
intended to be.</p>
<p>Several councils have therefore put forward proposals for
constitutional changes to enhance the authority of trades councils
locally; enabling them to assist and co-ordinate all industrial and
social struggles in their districts.</p>
<p>Resolution No.&nbsp;1 from the Brighton, Hove and District trades
council asks the TUC to &#8220;reconsider the possibility of direct
representation of shop stewards&#8217; committees on trades councils.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>For direct representation of shop stewards&#8217; committees</h4>
<p class="fst">At present trades councils can only contact such stewards
indirectly through branches, but in most cases the branch delegates
are not stewards. Direct representation would enable trades councils
to more speedily reflect day to day struggles of workers.</p>
<p>At the same time it would make it easier to co-ordinate their
activities when a national call to action is made by the TUC.</p>
<p>If this resolution was implemented it would enormously strengthen
the cohesion and solidarity of the local trade unions.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution No.&nbsp;2</strong> refers to the need &#8220;to strengthen
the TC County associations&#8221; with particular reference to their key
role in &#8220;co-ordinating long running official disputes and fighting
the employers&#8217; practice of black-listing.&#8221; It also calls for
constitutional change and proposes that at least on representative
from each trades council be elected to TUC regional councils as a
constitutional right.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is also an indirect reference to the scandalous sacking of
Derek Robinson from Leyland. This resolution expresses &#8220;its grave
concern that shop stewards who put forward alternative proposals to
those of management can be dismissed without consultation with TUC
representatives concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p>It calls upon the &#8220;TUC to use all measures in its power to
ensure that shop stewards should not be dismissed without
consultation with the full-time officer of the union concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p>This resolution is therefore pressing for a real application of
the traditional working class principle that &#8220;an injury to one is
an injury to all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Too often has a valiant defence of trade union principles by rank
and file delegates, as at Grunwick and now at Chix of Slough been
abandoned by the TUC. Every time this happens the trade union
movement as a whole is weakened.</p>
<p>Almost all the 28 resolutions reflect the growing anger of trade
unionists against the ruthless attack of the Tory government on the
social gains won by the workers in a hundred years of struggle.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution No.&nbsp;9</strong>, for example, calls for
&#8220;non-co-operation with the government&#8217;s anti-trade union
legislation&#8221; and asks the TUC &#8220;to get assurance from the Labour
Party that when returned to office they will repeal all the
anti-trade union legislation.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also calls upon the TUC &#8220;to wage an uncompromising campaign
against these anti-working-class measures.&#8221; It calls for a
restoration of all cuts in social benefits and an extension instead
of a contraction of existing social services. All the demands in
these resolutions must certainly be backed by the Labour Party in or
out of office.</p>
<p>If there is a weakness in the resolutions, it is in the section
dealing with economic affairs. Resolution No.&nbsp;7 &#8220;recognises
the reality of the world economic crisis of capitalism.&#8221; It also
calls for a reduction in working hours as a means of combating mass
unemployment. This must be supported by the entire movement.</p>
<p>The solution it proposes, though, is the &#8216;alternative economic
strategy.&#8217; It does not define what this strategy is, but as the
articles on the centre pages of this week&#8217;s paper show, &#8220;you
cannot control what you don&#8217;t own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only the taking over of all the commanding heights of the economy
and the driving through of a socialist economic plan will bring about
any real increase in the production of real wealth in Britain today.</p>
<p>Writing in the <strong>Labour Standard</strong> 99 years ago Frederick
Engels, who kept in close touch with the London Trades Council, wrote
the following inspired words:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The workpeople of England have but to will and they
are masters to carry every reform social and political which this
situation requires. Then why not make that effort?&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Today this situation requires that that effort be made to
fundamentally change society. In bringing together all sections of
the working class, the trades councils of Britain can play an
historic part in bringing that change about.</p>
