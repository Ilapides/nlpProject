<p class="fst"><strong>Every AUEW member knows that the lynch-pin of the engineering
industry is machine tool production. It is this lynch-pin which was
knocked out last week, when Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s government encouraged
the close-down and break up of Alfred Herbet&#8217;s, at one time the
leading tool builders in Europe.</strong></p>
<p>This latest example of Thatcher&#8217;s policy of deindustrialisation
aims at such a high level of unemployment that the unions will be
forced to accept a cut in real wages.</p>
<p>The jobs of every man and woman in the industry are now at stake,
and the only protection against a situation worse than the 1930s is a
fighting trade union. We need a union which will counter attack by
forcing the bosses to accept a 35-hour week as accepted by the
present Executive Council of the AUEW.</p>
<p>Our union has a proud record. It has always stood in the vanguard
of the working class to change society. Under its first socialist
secretary, Tom Mann, the old AEU fought for real amalgamation and
&#8220;one union for one industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>It led to the great battles of the last century for the 10-hour
and then the 8-hour day. It was the first to recognise the great
Clydeside general strike for the 40-hour week in 1919. It was because
of the courageous strikes led by our union that the &#8220;Industrial
Relations Act&#8221; was defeated under the last Tory government.</p>
<p>It was the vote of the AUEW delegation at last year&#8217;s Labour
Party Conference which made possible the passing of the resolution on
mandatory re-selection of MPs &#8211; one of the greatest steps forward
in the application of real democracy since the Labour Party was formed.</p>
<p>It is this progressive and militant tradition of our union which
is today being undermined.</p>
<p>At a time when the immediate application of the 35-hour week
without loss of pay is a crucial means of fighting unemployment in
the industry, our national leadership rewarded the enormous
self-sacrifice made by our members during last winter&#8217;s strike by
settling for a one-hour reduction and then accepting the employers&#8217;
demand for a four-year moratorium on any future demands for the
35-hour week.</p>
<p><em>At the rate that engineering factories are now closing down
[60,000 in the Birmingham area alone last month] the majority of our
members could be out of work in four years&#8217; time!</em></p>
<p>Although some advance in the basic rate was achieved by the recent
strike, this was achieved by the determination of the AUEW members to
stick the strike out, despite the confusing tactic of one-, two-, and
three-day strikes called for by the Executive.</p>
<p>A much greater advance both on the rate and towards the 35-hour
week without loss of pay could have been won if the leadership had
been willing to mobilise the full strength of the union in an all-out
national strike.</p>
<p>Engineers now need a &#0163;100 minimum time rate index-linked, to
combat rises in the cost of living.</p>
<p>The Employment Bill, aimed at undermining our bargaining power, as
was the Industrial Relations Act in the 1970s by the Heath
administration. Yet we see our executive already preparing the way
for a policy of retreat.</p>
<p>Already Bro. Duffy has stated that the Executive can see no reason
why the union should not accept the &#8220;softening up&#8221; money offered
by the government to pay for all kinds of postal ballots. This means
that the Executive Council is already accepting the &#8216;carrot&#8217;
which will lead on to the eating of the whole unpleasant dish.</p>
<p>Just as accepting government registration was the key which would
have forced us to accept the whole of the Industrial Relations Act
which Heath proposed, so taking this &#8216;Judas&#8217; money will place the
union under certain obligations to the government, and will be used
by it, to involve the unions in the whole process of the present
Employment Bill.</p>
<p>The one step that our Executive now seems to have taken toward Mr
Prior can lead to our union losing its independence.</p>
<p>Over many years the AUEW built up a democratic structure which our
members could be proud of, but unless we can remove the present
right-wing domination in the EC and National Committee, the
democratic rights of ordinary members will be seriously curtailed by
the moves of the present Executive to alter the rules.</p>
<p>By their success in pushing through the present form of postal
balloting for the election of national officers, the right wing
tipped the balance in favour of their own election. They are now
seeking to reap the fruits of that change of rules.</p>
<p>For the first time, the press was given the opportunity to
seriously influence the internal affairs of the union by discrediting
left-wing candidates and glorifying their opponents. The propaganda
favouring the right-wing candidates influenced large numbers of
card-holders who never attend Branch meetings or take any part in the
work of maintaining and building the union.</p>
<p>The idea of the postal ballot was that these non-active members
would swamp out the loyal and active members who dedicate themselves
to keeping the union organisation alive. We are therefore getting
National Presidents and General Secretaries elected as a result of
the intervention of the pro-capitalist press.</p>
<p><em>The enormously expensive postal ballot system certainly
produced a higher percentage vote than the old method of branch
voting, but it is still a minority vote and is now falling again. The
answer is to work for the transfer of balloting to the shop floor
where the real strength of the union lies. This method, already used
by the miners, would be by far the most democratic.</em></p>
<p>Policies of the candidates could be properly discussed at shop
meetings and the ballot organised under the supervision of the shop steward.</p>
<p>Having gained its position by the present unfair system of
balloting, the right wing is now moving towards other undemocratic
organisational changes. Already proposals have been made to scrap
most of the present branches and re-group them together into much
larger regional branches under full-time paid secretaries. This would
obviously make it more difficult for members to attend and is clearly
designed to lessen the possibility of genuine rank and file control.</p>
<p>In the field of amalgamation too it is clear that the approach of
our executive is one that favours a bureaucratic rather than a
democratic form of organisation. The President and other continually
complain about the TASS refusal to conform with the AUEW rule book
and accept election of full-time officers.</p>
<p>It has to be said that the attitude of TASS on this question is
indefensible and has allowed the right wing to point to the
undemocratic nature of the left. TASS is led by Ken Gill, a member of the CP.</p>
<p>But this is merely a smokescreen to hide the fact that our
Executive is not interested in an amalgamation with TASS because of
the left position it takes on many important issues. This hypocrisy
of the right wing was shown at rules revision conference when they
tried to push through the appointment of full-time branch secretaries
but were compelled to retreat by the weight of opposition to this proposal.</p>
<p>The right wing strongly favour amalgamation with the EETPU which
is bureaucratically controlled by the extreme right wing.</p>
<p>Of course a genuinely democratic amalgamation with the EETPU
should be supported by all trade unionists standing for working class
unity, but the EETPU under Frank Chapple, has succeeded in
introducing the general principle of selection rather than election
of full-time officers and changing branch structure along the lines
our Executive now seems to hanker after.</p>
<p>The question therefore arises, would the EETPU be asked to conform
with our rules as they stand or are we going to be asked to change ours?</p>
<p>What has happened in factories all over Britain in recent months
shows that the majority of working men and women in the industry do
want the union to adopt a fighting policy. In case after case, where
the workers have initially taken militant action against threatened
redundancy or the dismissal of militant shop stewards, but they have
been forced to accept defeat or a feeble compromise by our present
Executive officers.</p>
<p>An outstanding example of this was the dismissal of Derek
Robinson. True to our traditions, the workers in his factory took
immediate action. Had they been immediately backed by the AUEW
Executive, this disgraceful sacking of a steward for openly
expressing his opinion against the views of management would never
have taken place.</p>
<p>By their calculated procrastination, our union leadership turned
what should have been a workers&#8217; victory into a defeat, a defeat
not only in one factory, but for the whole union organisation
throughout the Leyland combine and nationally. This surrender to the
will of the &#8220;Whiz-kid&#8221; Edwardes has lowered the whole standing
and prestige of our union in the industry.</p>
<p>How is the damage done to be put right? We must revive a new
genuine Broad Left, which will re-mobilise all the class-conscious
and militant members of the union, a left which will avoid the
mistakes of the past, which will strive to win the mass of the
members for a clear programme of action and socialist policies.</p>
<p>Experience has shown that it is not enough to put blind faith in
electing individuals to office, but to concentrate on winning the
workers for an alternative policy to that of the right-wing opportunists.</p>
<p>Industrial tactics under Scanlon turned out to be no more
effective than under Duffy. The guerrilla type of strikes practised
in 1972/73 and advocated by the lefts on the EC and National
Committee unnecessarily dispersed the forces of the union and
achieved very little. It is a strange paradox that the present
right-wing tactics advocating one-, two- and three-day strikes are
not all that different from those advocated during the Scanlon era.</p>
<p>Such purely partial mobilisation of the union&#8217;s strength is
inefficient and unnecessarily long-winded. To gain a real
breakthrough in minimum wage-rates &#8211; still more to win the 35-hour
week (now, not in four years) &#8211; we need an Executive with the
courage to mobilise all the resources of the union for all-out
national strike action.</p>
<p>In the coming presidential election, a revitalised left must of
course campaign to get Bob Wright elected against Duffy. However, in
doing this we must keep in mind how the &#8220;left&#8221; Scanlon, during
the period of his journey from union head office to the House of
Lords, ended up taking a right-wing position on most of the crucial
issues facing the working class at that time.</p>
<p>He supported the so-called Social Contract when his union
conference had opposed it, he supported incomes policy and the 5%
when the trade union movement opposed it. He twice defied the
decision of his own delegation at Labour Party Conference.</p>
<p>To win elections is not enough. Those we put forward must be
committed to a programme which the workers understand and fight for.</p>
<p>The whole working class movement is now threatened with a return
to the &#8217;30s. Thatcher and her guru Sir Keith Joseph are
deliberately engineering mass redundancies so that unemployment can
be used as a whip to force the working class to accept a permanently
lower standard of living.</p>
