<p class="fst"><b>From 1936 we were becoming increasingly interested in the
heroic struggle of the working class of Spain. Hundreds of those who
had recently marched in the columns of the Hunger Marchers now found
themselves slowly winding down the valley of Jarama in the face of
withering machine-gun fire from Franco’s Moorish troops. Many of
these men had nothing in their pockets but a ticket to the Spanish
frontier. They came from Glasgow, Newcastle, Liverpool, London,
Brighton, South Wales and many other places. Many gave their lives
because they knew that the Spanish working class was not only making
a stand on behalf of the workers of the world against the spreading
plague of fascism, but also because the victory of Franco in Spain
would lead to the even greater mass slaughter of a Second World War.</b></p>

<p>Here too in Spain, the workers were misled. Fascism could have
been stopped in Spain if the workers’ leaders, of the Socialist,
Communist and Anarchist parties had fought for a clear-cut socialist
programme instead of trying to appease the allegedly “liberal”
capitalists at home and abroad by limiting the struggle to a call for
a “democratic capitalist republic”. Only <i>social</i> revolution
could have won the war against Franco. On the level of a purely
<i>military</i> struggle, the odds were stacked heavily in Franco’s
favour. The LYPS has done a service to the whole of the labour
movement by raising these lessons of the Spanish Civil War in the
bulletins of the Spanish Young Socialists’ Defence Campaign.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Fascism</h4>

<p class="fst">It was during those bitter years when European fascism was
trampling down the last bastion of democratic resistance in Spain
that at home a partial economic recovery was taking place. With some
increase in the demand for labour, the organised workers regained a
little bargaining power. The first successful strikes began to dispel
the memories of the years of industrial defeat. The London busmen led
the way with a solid strike gaining some advances. In 1937, as a
result of a successful apprentices’ strike which began in the
Glasgow engineering and shipbuilding industries, the AEU gained the
right to negotiate with the masters on behalf of all young workers in
engineering. The Shop Stewards movement became effective, especially
in the aircraft industry.</p>

<p>In France and the USA huge sit-in strikes took place, especially
in the new motor factories. Once more, the working class began slowly
to move forward.</p>

<p>This partial capitalist stabilisation did not last long. By 1938
all the signs pointed to a new economic blizzard on the way. In the
winter before the outbreak of war, the National Unemployed Workers
Movement (NUWM) was again organising large demonstrations. Many of
those who came back from Spain helped to organise unemployed
“laydowns” in snow-covered Oxford Street. In 1939 a new hunger
march was being contemplated. Mosley’s jackbooted blackshirts were
again on the prowl hoping to exploit a developing economic
downturn.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Crisis</h4>

<p class="fst">Capitalism was once again looking for a way out of a new economic
crisis. It found this in the outbreak of another mass slaughter –
the Second World War. This was the price the working class was forced
to pay for the failure to carry through the socialist revolution when
it could have been carried through in the 1920’s, especially in
Germany.</p>

<p>In 1939, the capitalist establishments of France and Britain saw
that Hitler was not, as they had hoped, aiming his Nazi hordes
against the USSR, but was threatening their own economic and
political schemes of influence. As in the First World War, they found
themselves incapable of mobilising for war without gaining the
support of the labour and trade union leaders.</p>

<p>The Labour leaders gave this support and both the Labour Party
and, after the Nazi attack on the USSR in 1941, the Communist Party,
declared a “political truce” with their own ruling class.
However, contrary to the claims of the orthodox historians, it is
doubtful if the rank and file accepted the implications of this
truce. Indeed, the strike statistics during the war period show a
different attitude on the part of the industrial workers.</p>

<p>The desperate need of the capitalists for workers in uniform and
for intensified production of war materials strengthened the
bargaining power of the workers. Soon the membership of the unions
began to catch up and surpass the figure it had reached after the
First World War.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Coalition</h4>

<p class="fst">In 1945, the “flying bombs” stopped and the survivors of the
battlefields and the POW camps began to stream home. Many Labour
leaders, but in particular the Communist Party, visualised a
continuation of the “political truce”. <i>In fact the CP actually
advocated the continuation of an allegedly “Democratic” Coalition
with Churchill still in command.</i></p>

<p>The working class, in and out of uniform, drew an entirely
opposite conclusion. The workers gave Labour an overwhelmingly
landslide victory with a 206-seat majority in 1945. They were joined
by a significant section of the middle and lower-middle classes.</p>

<p>The Labour Party now had what its leaders always claimed they
needed – an overwhelming majority of the people behind it. This was
an historic vote in favour of a fundamental change in society and for
socialism.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Missed</h4>

<p class="fst">Once again, the opportunity was missed. The broken down industries
which the capitalists did not want to invest in were nationalised.
This was done at enormous cost in terms of excessive compensation and
enormous capital outlay by the State in order to modernise the mines,
railways and power industries, which the bosses had ruined. 80% of
the country’s wealth and means of production remained in the hands
of the 5% of the very rich. Instead of carrying through the planned
socialisation of the economy, the Labour leaders preferred to prop up
the old system through American loans.</p>

<p>Their “theorists” then invented the “mixed economy” to
describe what was really the same old system of exploiting the
workers labour power, but now with state assistance. In this way, the
huge wave of radicalisation which swept through the working class in
1945 was channelled into safe waters, enabling the bosses to ride out
the post-war storm. On this basis, capitalism was able to stabilise
itself for a whole historical period – the period of the post-war
upswing, which lasted an entire generation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, by 1964, the underlying sickness of the “mixed
economy” in Britain was openly revealing itself. The long post-war
boom had camouflaged the economic decline of the British Empire. Yet
all this time Britain’s share of world trade was falling from 25%
in 1949 to less than 10% in 1967. As soon as the world economic boom
came to an end, towards the very end of the 1960’s, this weakness
of British capitalism in the world markets became painfully obvious.
This precipitated the devaluations of 1967 and 1971.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>“Affluent”</h4>

<p class="fst">Now we live in another era of economic crisis and uncertainty when
attacks on the standards of living of working people and mass
unemployment are once again the order of the day. So much for the
myth of the ‘mixed economy’ and the ‘Affluent Society’!</p>

<p>Even though the period of the economic boom is now over and has
given way to a new period of capitalist crisis, it has left an
important legacy for the organised labour movement of today. The long
upturn after the War enabled the labour movement to heal the wounds
inflicted during the pre-war slump. The material standards of our
class, not without trade union struggle, did slowly rise. The trade
unions became stronger and stronger during the period of relatively
“full employment”. Today a new generation, no longer inhibited by
the defeats suffered between the wars has gained a new confidence and
will fight to retain the gains that have been made. Perhaps the young
workers of the 1970’s still suffer from the reformist illusions
built up during the period of alleged affluence when Tory Prime
Minister Harold MacMillan coined the phrase “You’ve never had it
so good”. <i>They will nevertheless fight tooth and nail against
any return to the 1930’s, which is all that sick British capitalism
can now offer the working class.</i></p>

<p>So for the fourth time in my lifetime history presents the labour
movement with the opportunity to end the crisis-ridden and decadent
capitalist system. This is the perspective of the period ahead.</p>

<p>In 1917, the Russian workers broke the chain of imperialism at its
weakest link. The European working class <b>did</b> respond but its
leaders sidetracked the struggle, and the revolutionary wave failed,
leaving the Russian workers’ state isolated, weak and prone to
degeneration in backward Russia, despite the huge gains of the
nationalised, planned economy.</p>

<p>In 1926, the British workers, though weakened by previous fights
against wage cuts, were ready to carry the General Strike through to
a victorious conclusion but the right wing leaders preferred to
reprieve the capitalist system.</p>

<p>In 1945, the overwhelming majority of the working people in
Britain gave the Labour politicians a mandate to bring about a
fundamental socialist change in society. And yet again, despite the
carrying through of valuable reforms like the setting up of the
National Health Service, the Tories were given a chance to return to
power when the Labour Government “ran out of steam”, started to
“consolidate” and to “hesitate” in pushing ahead with its
programme.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Marxist</h4>

<p class="fst">What is the prospect for the period ahead? There can be no denying
the tremendous opportunities open to the new generation of workers.
Their combativity and willingness to fight is beyond question. It
seems that the natural response of the workers of today to mass
redundancies is factory occupation and the most militant struggles.
The trade union movement is stronger today than it has ever been in
history – with 11 million workers organised in the TUC. This is a
colossal force that has defeated a Tory Government and overturned its
cherished Industrial Relations Act. But the key question that still
remains is to equip this immensely powerful movement with a clear
programme and perspective. A lack of leadership is what has “led”
the workers to defeat so many times in the past. This is the burning
need of the months and years ahead – the fight for a clear
socialist programme in the labour movement. <i>The LPYS can play an
enormous role in this struggle if it learns the lessons of history
and intensifies the fight for its Marxist policies in the broad
labour movement.</i></p>
