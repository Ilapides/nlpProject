<p class="fst">The defeat of Bob Wright and Jimmy Reid in the recent elections
for the AUEW Executive Council now makes the struggle to defend the
standard of living of the engineering workers more difficult. For the
first time in nearly 10 years the right wing have a clear majority on
the leading body of the union. Couple with setbacks for the &#8216;Broad
Left&#8217; in regional elections, this means that those who wish the
union to bow to the needs of capitalism in crisis will for a time
determine the policy of the union.</p>
<p>The strengthening of the right wing in the second largest trade
union will make big business more determined than ever to snatch back
the material gains of the working class over the last half century.</p>
<p>At the present moment the party of big business (the Tories) do
not want another election. They hope that a right wing dominated
Labour Movement, by exploiting the workers&#8217; instinctive loyalty to
a Labour Government, will be able to cajole the working people into
accepting measures of severe wage restriction, cuts in social
services and unemployment, which would never have been tolerated from
a Tory Government.</p>
<p>These sacrifices are presented to the workers as being necessary
not only in the interests of the country, but of the Labour Movement.</p>
<p>Never was there a bigger &#8216;con&#8217; in the course of history! If
this kind of argument is accepted by the working class for any length
of time it will result in disaster for the Labour Movement. It is
these spurious arguments made by the so-called &#8220;moderates&#8221;
(really extreme rightists) in the Labour Movement which undoubtedly
have affected some sections of the rank and file who imagine they are
saving the Labour Government.</p>
<p>These are the objective conditions that for the time being have
favoured the right wing contestants in the recent AUEW elections.
However it would be wrong to claim that this is the only, or even the
main reason for the defeat of the &#8216;Broad Left&#8217; and the Communist
Party which manipulates it. Nor is it true as the &#8216;Broad Left&#8217;
argues that the right wing advance is entirely due to the
intervention of the mass media in favour of the right wing
candidates. It is true that the capitalist controlled press has
pretended to be extremely concerned about &#8220;democracy&#8221; in the
union and because of the introduction of the postal ballot the
newspapers and other media have been able to influence the thousands
of union members who never attend branch meetings.</p>
<p>Indeed the rules of our union have been subverted by outside
forces since no direct canvassing in favour of candidates is allowed
by union rule.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Involve members</h4>
<p class="fst">However, the influence of the mass media is not the decisive
factor in causing the defeat of the left. The confused and
opportunist tactics of the &#8216;Broad Left&#8217; are also responsible for
this setback to militant trade unionism.</p>
<p>In attacking the postal ballot it has tended to ignore the
indisputable fact that the postal ballot has produced a far higher
proportion of the membership voting than under the old system of a
show of hands or ballots at the branches.</p>
<p>It is not enough to say these masses of members who previously did
not vote are &#8220;backward&#8221; and &#8220;apathetic&#8221; and therefore are
most easily influenced by the capitalist mass media. These members in
fact represent a majority of the union membership and <em>before any
progressive and militant policy can be carried out these thousands of
members must be won over. There is no way that the left can avoid
this necessary task if a policy of genuine working class struggle is
to be carried out</em>.</p>
<p>Whatever means of voting for official positions is adopted, these
members, apparently written off by the &#8216;Broad Left&#8217; as the
&#8220;backward mass&#8221;, must be integrated into the activities of the
union and the maximum possible number of their votes must be recorded.</p>
<p>The emphasis of the &#8216;Broad Left&#8217; campaigning rested almost
entirely on the complaint that the small minority doing most of the
work &#8211; the old pillars of the declining branches &#8211; were being
unjustly excluded from the rewards of office. Further, the &#8216;Broad
Left&#8217; appeared to advocate a return to the old branch system of
voting as the only alternative to the postal ballot, completely
ignoring the fact that year by year the proportion of members voting
has been declining until it reached less than 8% of the membership.
<em>This 8% was electing the national officers for a union of 1&#0188;
million members. A ludicrous position.</em></p>
<p>Certainly it must be admitted that the present form of ballot
plays into the hands of the capitalist press and therefore favours
the right wing. However this does not mean advocating a return to the
old method which was also undemocratic in actual practice. <em>No, the
alternative should be to transfer the voting for offices to the
present day centre of gravity of the union &#8211; the workshop floor.</em>
Then the voting can take place at the point of production where all
the members can be found.</p>
<p>The voting by ballot or otherwise should in this way be organised
by the shop stewards who are the only officers of the union that the
vast majority of the members know and take seriously.</p>
<p>The preliminary activities of such election should be preceded by
the calling of a series of shop meetings at which the vital issues
are explained to the members and where possible the candidates are
invited to put their respective points of view on policy.</p>
<p>Apart from the wrong approach to the postal ballot question the
faulty industrial tactics of the &#8216;Broad Left&#8217;/Communist Party
axis rebounded against their own candidates. The beginning of the
discrediting of the &#8216;Broad Left&#8217; began in Manchester nearly three
years ago, when instead of calling on the whole membership to take
industrial action when the Employer&#8217;s Federation contemptuously
turned down our claim, the Executive Council recommended that the
battle should be fought at a purely local level. It was to be left to
the lads on the shop floor to organise their own independent and
separate actions to win the claim. A claim which incidentally could
be described as a &#8216;mini&#8217; Engineers&#8217; Charter.</p>
<p>This method was recommended by the Executive Council and endorsed
by the National Committee as actually being more militant and up to
date than that of national strike action! As should have been
foreseen, this vague recommendation to go on strike if the lads felt
they needed to was interpreted in different ways by different
districts. The Executive Council was in fact saying go on strike if
you wish, lads, then we&#8217;ll see how we can back you up.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Manchester sit-ins</h4>
<p class="fst">In Manchester these confused guide lines resulted in a full
conference of local stewards and the calling of a &#8216;mini&#8217; local
general strike, mostly consisting of sit-ins. Immediately the EEF saw
its chance. &#0163;1 million was put at the local employers&#8217; disposal
and a war of attrition began. Unfortunately few similar movements
took place in other parts of the country and the Manchester strikers
became isolated. Meantime for five or six weeks the union paid out
strike benefit which eventually reached a very considerable sum
indeed. In no case did the workers who staged these guerrilla actions
win the full claim.</p>
<p>The large sums paid out in benefit for little return began the
period of the union&#8217;s financial difficulties exacerbated by
inflation. The lack of any clear cut victory resulted in a serious if
temporary decline in morale among the general membership. This was at
a time when the miners were going into battle and by fully
co-ordinating national action gained a great victory. If the National
Committee had called a national strike vastly superior gains could
have been made, and at less cost at that.</p>
<p>These guerrilla tactics gave the right wing all the &#8216;handles to
grind&#8217; they could wish for. It enabled them to claim that not only
industrial tactics were wrong (of course they wouldn&#8217;t have
favoured national action either) but that the financial affairs of
the union were being mishandled!</p>
<p>Among the &#8216;Broad Left&#8217; and Communist Party members are many
sincere and courageous workers but they have all been misled. For all
practical purposes the &#8216;Broad Left&#8217; has been used almost
exclusively as an election machine to gain official positions. The
concentration of all efforts on capturing positions had now proved to
be counter-productive and allowed the right wing to creep back to the
detriment of all who wish to see a bold and militant policy in the union.</p>
<p>A really effective left would constantly point out that in the
period of the irreversible decay of British capitalism, the full
force of the union can be mobilised to defend and improve the living
standards of its members only if this struggle is linked with the
struggle to lay the foundations of socialism by taking over the
commanding heights of the economy, working on the basis of a
socialist economic plan.</p>
