<p class="fst"><strong>We Shall Not Starve in Silence<br/>
A History of the National Unemployed Workers Movement 1920&#8211;46</strong><br/>
by Richard Croucher<br/>
<em>Lawrence &amp; Wishart, &#0163;12.50, 1987</em></p>
<p class="fst">From the mid-1920s to the outbreak of war in 1939, the unemployed
workers movement was led by sincere and dedicated Communist workers,
men and women. But such gains as the National Unemployed Workers
Movement (NUWM) made were despite the zig-zag opportunism of the
Communist Party. Even today, although the unemployed are still
treated as second-class citizens and are relegated to the poverty
trap, they still benefit from the fight put up by the NUWM.</p>
<p>While it would be an exaggeration to say that the NUWM brought
about the welfare state (or what is left of it today), Richard
Croucher is right when he says: &#8220;the NUWM laid the foundation for a
new system of social benefits traditionally credited to the Beveridge
Report.&#8221; Beveridge himself was disappointed in the way his ideas
were implemented, as well he might have been; nevertheless he
provision of social security all became less humiliating than in the
1930s and the period of the infamous means test, the worst features
being the &#8216;on the parish&#8217; relief from the Board of Guardians. It
is hard to conceive this would have happened without the work of the NUWM.</p>
<p>Many academic studies of the period including those on the left
either completely ignore the role of the NUWM or greatly exaggerate
it. But as Engels was fond of saying, facts are stubborn things. All
the contemporary newspaper reports show that in 1935 the NUWM did
rouse whole communities to march against the news scales of benefit
proposed by the National government. The NUWM organised mass
demonstrations. In South Wales these took on a genuinely mass
character because of unity with the miners union &#8211; bringing 300,000
onto the streets. This momentarily forced the government into
retreat. Croucher describes what followed these upheavals:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Oliver Stanley, the Minister of Labour, announced next
day that Board benefit scales were to be suspended and claimants
would be entitled to UAB or PAC scales whichever were the higher. In
effect this means that there was to be no cut in benefit and the
means test conditions were to be ignored. Wally Hannington, the NUWM
leader, then sent out a circular on 4 January 1935 under with the
heading &#8216;Smashing victory for NUWM&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">But the weakness of Croucher&#8217;s analysis is that it does not
adequately explain why from a peak of support in 1935, the NUWM
declined into a hard core of Communist and militant workers capable
only of organising publicity stunts such as laying down in
snow-covered Oxford Street, or chaining themselves to town hall
railings or gate crashing the Ritz hotel. Many of the lads performing
these exercises were ex-members of the International Brigade in Spain.</p>
<p>And that was one reason for the decline &#8211; the loss of these
cadres in the struggle in Spain as well as the recovery in the
economy after 1935 with the expansion of the arms industry preceding
the war. But this does not fully explain the withering away of the
NUWM when on the eve of the war there were still one and a half
million unemployed. Indeed, immediately after the outbreak of war, I
personally led a demonstration of around 1,000 unemployed laid off
from the old Morris works in Oxford Cowley &#8211; so there was still a
cause for the NUWM to fight for.</p>
<p>Instead we must look to the policies of the NUWM leadership to
explain its decline. And to give Croucher his due, he does describe
in some detail the often sharp differences between Hannington in the
NUWM and the Communist Party central committee which sought to direct
his work. The Comintern attempted to interfere in the work of the
NUWM. They almost split the NUWM when they insisted on loose and
vague &#8216;unemployed councils&#8217; as an alternative to the union-like
structure of the NUWM which at one time had 50,000 people paying
dues. Hannington and the recently deceased Harry McShane, the NUWM
secretary in Scotland, tried to compromise with the Comintern
&#8216;directive&#8217; by proposing unemployed councils alongside the NUWM.
Anyway the Comintern&#8217;s idea never caught on. But from then on the
CP regarded Hannington with some suspicion and he was dropped from
the central committee.</p>
<p>Croucher shows how the CP&#8217;s line had completely altered by 1938.
The NUWM had become an embarrassment under the popular front policy
of the Comintern which meant alliance and cooperation with the
capitalist state. But he does not analyse the theoretical and social
causes of this change in the CP line, which clearly lay with the
false theories of Stalin and the leadership of the the Comintern who
now looked to support from the capitalist democracies to preserve
their position, rather than mass action from the working-class.</p>
<p>This explains the decision of the CP to close down the NUWM on the
eve of the war, despite many active branches and resistance from its
membership. This attitude has been maintained by CP members on the
TUC General Council when they opposed moves to form a successor to
the NUWM in the early 1980s. It is an attitude that must and will be
reversed when unemployment rises to new heights in the next world slump.</p>
