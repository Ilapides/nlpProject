<p class="fst">The attempt of Len Murray the TUC General Secretary to pre-empt
the debate on Ireland at the National Conference of Trades Councils,
last weekend caused a sensational upset and spread wide resentment
amongst conference delegates.</p>
<p>Brother Murray used his privilege of addressing the conference to
attack a resolution on the issue of Ireland. Almost half of his
speech was devoted to denouncing this resolution which was not
debated until the last day of conference.</p>
<p>The main points of the resolution were for:&ndash;</p>
<ul>
<li>A British government commitment to withdraw from Northern
Ireland<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>A bill of rights for Northern Ireland<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
<li>The ending of the non-jury Diplock courts, and a review of
all cases tried under Diplock courts and restoration of special
category status to detainees.</li>
</ul>
<p class="fst">Brother Murray informed the delegates that if the resolution was
carried in opposition to what he said was TUC policy, then the
General Council would completely ignore the opinion of delegates.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the resolution was carried by a big majority and is
now the policy of the Trades Councils.</p>
<p>Despite short comings in the resolution it now means that debate
on Northern Ireland will be opened up in all Trades Councils, Trade
Union branches and at the Trades Union Congress.</p>
