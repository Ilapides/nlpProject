<p class="fst"><strong>DUDLEY EDWARDS, who was active in the Labour movement for more
than 60 years died peacefully on his birthday, 8 July.</strong></p>
<p>He was born in Reading, but spent most of his early life in
Southall and Ealing. In his early teens he joined the Independent
Labour Party Guild of Youth Cycling Club, which brought together two
passions that were to stay with him for the rest of his life &#8211; the
labour movement and the countryside.</p>
<p>As he was later to admit, in those early years he did not
understand the class nature of society. The General Strike of 1926
changed that. Dudley was in Southampton, looking for work: &#8220;I saw
Oxford and Cambridge students driving down to scab on dockers. I saw
armoured cars and soldiers protecting them.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the slump of 1929, Dudley became involved in the battles of
the unemployed, organising branches of the National Unemployed
Workers&#8217; Movement in London, Brighton and Oxford.</p>
<p>He joined the Communist Party in 1932, after Ramsay Macdonald had
deserted Labour to lead a Tory-dominated National Government.</p>
<p>In Brighton he also became involved in the fight against the
Mosley&#8217;s fascist blackshirts.</p>
<p>He particularly remembers when in 1934, William Joyce (who later
became notorious as &#8216;Lord Haw Haw&#8217;) was booked to speak at the
Dome. Several days before the fascist rally, anti-fascists got into
the building and an electrician carried out a few changes to the
public address system.</p>
<p>When Joyce arrived to speak, the <em>International</em> blared out
of the loudspeakers and the fascists were blockaded inside by
protesting workers!</p>
<p>Dudley saw the meaning of fascism for himself on a visit to
Germany shortly after Hitler came to power. There were still
stirrings of opposition among the working class and Dudley later
concluded that if a correct lead had been given by the Communist
Party, Hitler could still have been defeated.</p>
<p>Just before and during the second world war, he was Secretary of
Oxford Communist Party and a a member of the AEU district committee.
He worked for the Pressed Steel firm attached to the Nuffield car
works at Cowley, but was sacked for union activity and became a
full-time air-raid warden.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 60s, Dudley was convenor at an engineering
factory in Park Royal, West London, where he led a strike for union rights.</p>
<p>He had become increasingly disillusioned with the Communist Party,
but delayed his final break with Stalinism because there seemed to be
no alternative.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t finally leave the Communist Party until
1958,&#8221; he said: &#8220;It was a long process-Hungary, the 20th Congress
and Krushchev&#8217;s secret speech showed me the true nature of Stalin&#8217;s regime.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">He joined the Labour Party &#8220;to avoid being cut off from
developments&#8221;, but it was not until after he had moved back to
Brighton in 1964 that Dudley found the full-blooded socialism he had
been looking for.</p>
<p>He met a group based around the new <strong>Militant</strong> newspaper
which had discussion meetings in The Eagle pub. He was still taken in
by what he often called &#8220;the Stalinist falsification of history&#8221;
and had still to be convinced of Trotsky&#8217;s ideas &#8211; &#8220;I was
hostile at first and argued, so I was invited to speak at the next
discussion group, where my arguments were completely knocked down.&#8221;</p>
<p>From then until his death, Dudley was an active supporter of
<strong>Militant</strong>. He particularly saw the need to share his
experiences with younger comrades, in Britain and internationally.</p>
<p>During the last decade of his life, he went on many speaking tours
in Europe, particularly Sweden and Germany, where he became almost as
well known as in Brighton.</p>
<p>Dudley&#8217;s special interest was in the history of the working
class. He wrote pamphlets on the Levellers and the Oxford militia
mutiny. But he regarded history not as something to learn, but to
learn from.</p>
<p>For a long time he refused to write his political memoirs, saying:
&#8220;That&#8217;s a way of saying that you&#8217;ve reached the end of your
political life and I intend on doing a lot more.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a way Dudley proved himself right on both counts. He did write
his memoirs when he realised his health was failing, but he never
became the type of &#8216;veteran socialist&#8217; who only appeared from
time to time to speak at a meeting.</p>
<p>He remained actively involved in the Trades Council, which made
him a life member in 1982 and in the struggle of a new generation of
unemployed in the 1980s.</p>
<p>On the day of his death, Dudley had been invited to the opening of
a room at Brighton Unemployed Workers&#8217; Centre which was to be named
&#8216;The Dudley Edwards Room&#8217;. The opening ceremony took place sadly
without the guest of honour.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Dudley&#8217;s biggest regret would have been
not living long enough to see socialism in Britain and throughout the
world. But as he said once at a meeting in Brighton:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Even if I knew that socialism would not come in my
lifetime I&#8217;d still be a Marxist. That&#8217;s because the work that we
do now and the work that&#8217;s been done by every generation of
Marxists will make it easier for the working class to transform
society in the future.&#8221;</p>
