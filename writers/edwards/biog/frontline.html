<p class="fst"><strong>DUDLEY EDWARDS has been a front-line class fighter for most of
his years &#8211; and has no intention of stopping. His 80th birthday
party in Brighton last month was attended by comrades from as far
afield as Wales.</strong></p>
<p>Dudley, born in Reading, remembers lucidly past battles, victories
and defeats. These arm him with a perspective for the future &#8211; and
a goal, the socialist transformation of society.</p>
<p>He spent most of his early life in London &#8211; Southall and Ealing
&#8211; joining the Independent Labour Party Guild of Youth is his early teens.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I was not conscious then of the class nature of society,&#8221;
Dudley admits.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Rich scabs</h4>
<p class="fst">The General Strike of 1926 made the true nature of society clear
in Southampton where he went in search of work.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I saw Oxford and Cambridge students driving down to
scab on dockers. I saw armoured cars and soldiers protecting them.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">That early baptism in the practices of the ruling class steeled
Dudley for the struggle ahead: the great depression, battles against
the fascists in Brighton, disillusion with the Communist Party meekly
following Stalin&#8217;s treachery and finally, conviction of the
correctness of Lenin and Trotsky&#8217;s writings.</p>
<p>He remembers the time William Joyce (the traitor Lord Haw Haw) was
due to speak at a Blackshirt rally in the Dome, Brighton, in 1934. An
enterprising electrician wired up the interior of the hall about a
week before the fascist meeting.</p>
<p>As Joyce entered the Dome, scurrying past protesting workers
outside, and as the Union Jacks fluttered in the aisles, the
<em>Internationale</em> burst forth from the roof! The meeting ended in chaos.</p>
<p>Dudley remembers the comrade picked in his place for the
International Brigade to fight in the Spanish Civil War. Dudley was
turned down on medical grounds &#8211; he has a crippled leg. The comrade
fell in one of the early battles of the war.</p>
<p>He also recalls the long daily struggles as a victimised shop
steward in the Nuffield motor works at Cowley and later in Park
Royal, London where he saw the lack of support from the Communist
Party for workers&#8217; struggles.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t finally leave the Communist Party until
1958. It was a long process &#8211; Hungary, the 20th Congress and
Kruschev&#8217;s secret speech showed the true nature of Stalin&#8217;s
regime.</p> <p class="quote">&#8220;After I left, I shopped around the sects (ultra-left
groups) but soon came to the conclusion they hadn&#8217;t a clue what
they were talking about! So I joined the Labour Party to avoid being
cut off from developments.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Dudley moved back to Brighton in 1963&#8211;4 and soon was arguing
with a group based around a new <strong>Militant</strong> paper, meeting at the
<em>Eagle</em> public house.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I was hostile at first and argued &#8211; so I was invited
to speak at the next discussion group where my arguments were
completely knocked down&#8221;.</p>
<p class="fst">Dudley has read <strong>Militant</strong> since the second issue and has
seen the ideas take a strong hold in the labour movement.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Labour leaders</h4>
<p class="fst">And he is clear about the position of the Labour leadership with
their bankrupt witch-hunting tactics.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I think Kinnock and Co are scared of Marxism and know
in their hearts that they can&#8217;t deliver the goods under capitalism.
They could get away with cancelling out reforms it it wasn&#8217;t for <strong>Militant</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Dudley has just returned from a fact-finding tour of Northern
Ireland where he was very impressed by the work of socialists and
convinced of the need for radical change, there and on a world scale.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I look forward to the future when Marxism will strike
a chord with more and more workers. There <em>will</em> be a socialist
transformation of society.&#8221;</p>
