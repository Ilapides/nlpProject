<p class="fst">Dear comrades,</p>

<p class="fst">Yesterday, I attended the birthday party of Anton Nilsson, at a
small neat flat in a suburb of Stockholm. In less than three years,
Anton will reach 100 years of age, spanning the whole history of the
modern working class movement.</p>

<p>He was surrounded by his old comrades, mostly typical working
class men and women, in Sunday best in Anton’s honour. Each comrade
brought flowers and cards inscribed with signatures of inscriptions
of organisations and individuals.</p>

<p>All morning, Anton was called to the telephone to receive
congratulations from prominent people in the Swedish Social
Democratic Workers Party, and the trade unions. These congratulations
came from those on the right as well as the left. Among his comrades
was a kind of committee, or club, of old freedom fighters, people who
had served sentences for their devotion to the socialist cause.</p>

<p>Anton is still the undisputed and honoured leader of this group
and the only one sentenced to life imprisonment, for his action
against blacklegs in the great Swedish dock strike in 1908. Among
these old comrades were some communists, socialists, and other left
wingers who were thrown into concentration camps during the World
War, because they resisted the passage of Nazi troops and war
materials through Sweden. An act which was allowed by the Swedish
government of those days.</p>

<p>This is a little-known episode in the international fight against
fascism. As the afternoon wore on, it became clear that 96 year old
Anton was, in spirit, amongst the youngest of those present. He spoke
with great pride of his visit to the great <b>Militant</b> rally at
Wembley on September 10 of this year. He said it was a highlight in
his life.</p>

<p>He said the <b>Militant</b> supporters in Britain were now on the
right course and what he saw convinced him that a real turning point
had been reached in the revival of that revolutionary socialism which
he had joined as a young man 80 years before.</p>

<p>He asked me to convey his greetings to all those comrades he met
in Britain, and called again for a new working class international,
as he did at Wembley.</p>
