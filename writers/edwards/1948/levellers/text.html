<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="fst">History is written by the victors; the process by which rulers
rewrite the past in their own image was not invented by Stalin or
even by George Orwell. The one date that everyone remembers in 1066,
but only for the defeat of the Saxon army at Hastings, not for the
far more crushing victory gained by that same army over the Norsemen
at Stamford nine days earlier.</p>
<p>Nowhere is this remoulding of history more apparent than in the
history of those revolutionary upsurges where a new ruling class has
taken over power or where oppressed common people have taken up arms
to destroy their masters. Whole revolutionary movements disappear
under the pen of the historian, only to be rediscovered generations
later. Lies and truth are entangled so closely that the concept of
impartial &#8216;historical truth&#8217; becomes meaningless. The
unsuccessful risings of the peasantry and the working class are
stamped on so viciously and so thoroughly that their spokesmen, even
if they survive, are unable to speak in their own defence before the
bar of history.</p>
<p>The history of working class movements in Britain offers many
examples of this process. The leaflets produced during the Clydeside
strikes and army mutinies of 1918&#8211;19, the Chartist newspapers, even
the broadsheets of the Civil War still exist with their records of
the heroic struggles of the common people against tyranny and
exploitation. This material lies rotting in libraries while
professional historians either discount it or pick it over with great
care, separating it into a thousand tiny pieces, individually wrapped
in academic sterile dressings. With only a few honourable exceptions,
the history of the workers and peasants is left either to their open
enemies, or to &#8216;liberal&#8217; minds whose understanding and experience
of working class struggles can only be compared to the experiences of
eunuchs in a harem.</p>
<p>This is no accident. Just as the international working-class
movement has always learned from its experience, especially the
crystallisation of that experience as provided by Marxism, so it is
in the interests of the present ruling class to hide and distort the
records of that experience. In Britain, the Universities, &#8216;seats of
impartial learning&#8217; are bound to the capitalist class by a thousand
tangible and intangible threads of patronage, privilege and common
interest. For every academic historian sympathetic to working class
struggles we have ten or more hostile. The history of Britain is
presented to the general public as a slow inexorable growth of
democracy and justice from the departure of the Romans to the arrival
of Ted Heath. The British genius for &#8216;compromise&#8217; and &#8216;peaceful
reform&#8217; is praised to the skies and &#8216;unfortunate&#8217; incidents
like the Civil War, the Chartist revolt and the 1926 General Strike
are swept under the carpet. The fact that every single civil liberty
has had to be fought for and paid for in blood and suffering is
denied by the upholders of &#8216;impartial&#8217; history. The Civil War? &#8211;
Charles&#8217; pigheadedness. Tolpuddle? &#8211; unfortunate miscarriage of
justice. Peterloo massacre? &#8211; local magistrate doing his best in a
difficult situation caused by drunken mobs. Army mutinies? &#8211; never happened.</p>
<p>Such dishonesty makes it all the more important to republish and
discuss the documents, pamphlets and writings of our forbears. The
present pamphlet was originally written in commemoration of the three
hundredth anniversary of the events in describes, the mutiny in 1649
of those regiments of Cromwell&#8217;s victorious army stationed in
Salisbury at the end of the Civil War, Its sources are Leveller
pamphlets stored in the records department of Oxford Corporation.</p>
<p>Who were the Levellers? For an answer we must ask who did the
fighting in the Civil War &#8211; that massive upheaval which started in
1641 with the refusal of MP&#8217;s to pay taxes demanded by the King and
ended with that same King beheaded by order of Parliament. Richard
Baxter, a leading Puritan clergyman of the time, put the division clearly:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;A very great part of the knights and gentlemen of
England adhered to the King, ... And most of the tenants of those
gentlemen and also most of the poorest of the peoples whom the others
call the rabble did follow the gentry and were for the King. On
Parliament&#8217;s side were (beside themselves) the smaller part (as
some thought) of the gentry in most of the counties; and the greatest
part of the tradesmen and freeholders and middle sort of men,
especially in those corporations and counties which depend on
clothing and such manufactures.&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="fst">In general, the old aristocracy and their hangers on supported the
king, while the new businessmen, the freeholders and free yeomen
supported Parliament. There was a profound difference between the
king&#8217;s armies, officered by the nobility and professional soldiers
with peasant tenants fulfilling their traditional role of fighting
for their lords and masters, and the soldiers of parliament. The New
Model Army built by Cromwell to win parliament&#8217;s battles was
composed of free yeomen, smallholders and the like who fought for the
return of such basic freedoms as an end to the enclosure of common
land, religious tolerance and an end to being taxed to pay for the
church. They had been promised these things by the parliamentary
leaders and they fought for a parliament pledged to carry out these
promises. In Cromwell&#8217;s own words <em>&#8216;Russet coated captains who
knew what they fought for, loved what they knew.&#8217;</em></p>
<p>By 1649, the Parliamentary soldiers had learned a lot more about
their leaders, many of whom were doing very well out of the war,
buying up the land of defeated Royalists and raising rents, but
forgetting to pay the common soldiers who were fighting their
battles. Those soldiers articulate enough to put their disquiet into
words banded behind one spokesperson, John Lilburne. This man was,
after Cromwell, the best known and most publicly respected leader on
the Parliamentary side. He and his supporters pressed for the
implementation of the ideals for which the Parliamentary soldiers
fought. For their pains they were branded as &#8216;levellers&#8217; just as
the word &#8216;communist&#8217; is used today. The Levellers were of and for
the poor people against the war profiteers almost as much as they
were against the King. Obviously they were not revolutionaries, or in
most cases even socialists, as we understand the terms today.
Nevertheless, among their sometimes confused strains of thinking ran
for the first time a strong socialist current. As one of their
pamphlets <strong>The Mournfull Cries of Many Poor Tradesmen</strong> spelled
out in 1648: <em>&#8216;Is not all the controversie whose slaves the poor
shall be?&#8217;</em> (preceding by two hundred years the famous remark of
Marx <em>&#8220;The oppressed are allowed every few years to decide which
particular representatives of the ruling class shall represent and
repress them&#8221;</em>).</p>
<p>Many Leveller mutinies took place and many of their leaders were
shot, imprisoned and exiled. The events described in the present
pamphlet were at the high tide of the movement and the beginning of
its destruction by Cromwell in the interests of the new class of
property owners.</p>
<p>Still, the fate of the Levellers might at first seem only of
academic interest. After all, their battle was lost three hundred
years ago. But the British ruling class neither forgets nor forgives.
After the return of Charles II, Cromwell&#8217;s body was dug up and
displayed in a barbarous manner. His head was used as a plaything and
curio, and was only decently buried a few years ago. When it meets
its enemies the ruling class has no more &#8216;honour&#8217; or &#8216;decency&#8217;
than Hitler&#8217;s stormtroopers. Even now, all popular accounts of the
Civil War stress the &#8216;illegal&#8217;, &#8216;undemocratic&#8217; nature of
Cromwell&#8217;s regime, and public library books are attacked by
lunatics scrawling support for Charles. The passions of the Civil War
still live.</p>
<p>But why the hatred for Cromwell, when it appears from our account
that his victories ushered in the rule of the present capitalist
class? Precisely for the reasons outlined in this pamphlet; the Civil
War was the first and so far the most nearly successful attempt by
the common people of Britain to gain the stage of history with arms
in their hands. Charles was not defeated by the merchants of the City
of London, but by the yeomen and artisans of the New Model Army and
by the apprentices and common people who streamed out to stop his
army on the western approaches to London. When the spokesmen of
British capitalism view Charles&#8217; execution, they fancy their own
heads on the chopping block.</p>
<p>As the ruling class has not forgotten the lessons of its past
victories, neither should the working class.</p>

<h3>The Last Stand of the Levellers</h3>
<p class="fst">Three hundred years have passed since the revolutionary artisans
and yeomen of Cromwell&#8217;s army fought their last battle to win for
the common people something more than a mere exchange of masters.</p>
<p>Battle scarred, iron disciplined and politically conscious, they
saw that the overthrow of absolute monarchy and absolute tyranny was
leading only to a change of taskmasters, and that the great
parliamentary generals including even Cromwell himself were betraying
the interests of the masses to the Presbyterian merchant capitalists
of the City of London. They knew that these sanctimonious war
profiteers, victuallers and country squires now intended to reap for
themselves the economic fruits of the Civil War and awaited eagerly
the opportunity to buy up the requisitioned estates of the defeated
Royalists at knockdown prices. To realise their aims, however, they
first had to destroy the growing power of the politically aroused
petit-bourgeois masses, the artisans and craftsmen, who in the large
cities were beginning to form the nucleus of a working class, and
from which had sprung, in the main, the rank and file of the New
Model Army.</p>
<p>This mass of NCOs and privates, once cheered on but now scorned by
the city merchants, represented the cadres of the common people.
Their political morale had been carefully attended to by Cromwell
himself, who was the first general to realise that intense conviction
and faith in its cause enables a mainly civilian army to defeat the
traditional and ready-made military skill of an old ruling class. For
this very reason Cromwell had encouraged the development of the first
peoples&#8217; army. Towards the end of the Civil War it had become, in
fact, the first genuinely revolutionary army in history. In some
respects its democratic structure was more complete than that of the
revolutionary armies of France. Only three hundred years later can an
adequate comparison be found in the revolutionary spirit and
solidarity of the Red Guard detachments created by Lenin, Trotsky and
the Bolshevik Party during the overthrow of Tsarism in 1917.</p>
<p>It is not the intention of the present writer, a non-academic
worker-student, to evaluate the role of Cromwell in this historic
struggle, nor the effect of his activities on the ultimate growth of
the working class movement, as this is being done by more
professional Marxist historians. That Cromwell was the great realist
statesman of those stormy days there seems little doubt, and it is
probable that he carried forward the English bourgeois revolution as
far as the economic and social conditions of the period would permit.
It does not follow from this, however, that the Levellers, who in the
end bitterly attacked Cromwell, were hopeless visionaries hitting out
blindly against a political brick wall. For several years their
policy represented the only serious alternative to Cromwell&#8217;s.
Their immediate programme was a realistic one based upon the facts
and issues of the day, reflecting the genuine grievances of the
masses. Their movement was no &#8216;flash in the pan&#8217; but a well
organised and intelligently-led struggle lasting over several years.
Many of them were the very men upon whom Cromwell had relied to
maintain the morale of the army during the darkest days of the civil
war; dour, hymn-singing soldier-agitators, often self-educated and
ever-ready with an apt biblical text whenever their men needed
inspiration in their battles with the <em>&#8216;forces of Baal&#8217;</em>, as
they called the Royalists. Such veterans as these were a formidable
force and Cromwell had to use all his immense prestige, political
cunning, and even deception to defeat them. Indeed, if it had not
been for this the final battle at Burford might have had another result.</p>
<p>The final stages of this struggle were extremely tense and all
England must have been agog with rumour during these dramatic months
of 1649, yet for several hundred years after, few national history
books are found which devote more than a few lines to the whole
movement. No graves of the four ringleaders shot against Burford
churchyard wall can be found and their memory was buried so deeply by
the bourgeois historians that their very existence was almost
forgotten by the common people for whom they fought.</p>
<p>Today the working class movement with the aid of the Marxist
theory of social development is able to revive the revolutionary
traditions of the English people, and with the advance of Socialism
in all lands, mankind is again able to see the great historical
significance of these early English soldiers of democracy, who,
looking <em>&#8216;as into a glass darkly&#8217;</em> saw that it was not a
change of rulers for which they were fighting but the end of
exploitation of man by man.</p>
<p>The bourgeois revolution started in England in the 17th century,
coming nearly one hundred and fifty years before the French
Revolution. In France the struggle was fought out to a clear-cut
decision, whereas in England a peculiar compromise was reached
between the old feudal rulers and the rising capitalist class lasting
until the Industrial Revolution. In these circumstances such
revolutionary traditions as the rising of the Levellers did not
retain a vivid hold on the memory of the people or inspire the
proletarian movement to the extent that similar incidents have always
done in France. This is all the more reason why our great
revolutionary history must now be popularised among the workers, not
only to counter the reactionary and distorted picture of British
history favoured by Tories and many rightwing Labour leaders alike,
but as an inspiration to the working class in the decisive class
battles which lie ahead.</p>
<p>The Levellers&#8217; mutiny which culminated in the execution of their
leaders in Burford churchyard in 1649 was a relatively small incident
in the course of the left-wing fight for a democratic peace during
the years 1647&#8211;1650. No attempt is made here to trace all the
social conflicts which were being fought inside and outside the army
during this period. It is hoped only to give a description of the
dramatic series of incidents which led up to the final stand at
Burford and convey the heroism of the men of action who took part in it.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<a name="p2"></a>
<h4>Prologue &#8211; <em>The Agreement of the People</em></h4>
<p class="fst">The men who rose against their officers at Salisbury in the Spring
of 1649 and set out on their historic march to Burford did not all
regard themselves as Levellers. The title was mainly used as a term
of abuse by the country squires and London merchants, just as today
the word &#8216;red&#8217; or &#8216;Bolshevik&#8217; is so often used to create
prejudice against militant workers. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>
Lilburn himself, the national leader of the movement repudiated the
title; further, their demands did not include anything like a rough
and ready redistribution of property as the term leveller would
imply. There existed no organised working class movement as we know
it, nor any form of large scale manufacture, which are the conditions
in which the scientific conception of a classless society is
possible. Nevertheless, most of these men were politically conscious
and for several years they had been fighting for a truly democratic
government. On two occasions they had joined in great armed
demonstrations on a national scale, compelling Cromwell himself to
concede many of their demands, at least on paper.</p>
<p>These gatherings had taken place about eighteen months previously
at Newmarket Heath in June 1647 and at Thriplow Heath a few weeks
later. The first of these was endorsed by Cromwell but the latter
seemed to have been much more under the control of the rank and file
and more revolutionary in its decisions. Regimental delegates or
&#8216;agitators&#8217; as they were called were appointed by the rank and
file and a Grand Army Council set up on which the men&#8217;s
representatives sat together with an equal number of officers to
decide questions of policy. For some months this remained a genuinely
democratic body, remarkably similar to the system of soldiers&#8217; and
sailors&#8217; delegates elected throughout the armed forces during the
Russian Revolution of 1917. Eventually the army council came to be
dominated by the high officers and after the suppression of the
Levellers it was abolished. At Thriplow Heath the vast concourse of
soldiers who must have assembled there, took a solemn oath to keep
what came to be known as the &#8216;Engagement&#8217; and not to disband
until the liberties of England were secured. At the same time they
adopted a clear-cut political programme written in stirring language
and entitled <em>The Agreement of the People</em>. Thus the Levellers
made clear to Parliament and the people what was meant by securing
the liberties of England.</p>
<p>This was a remarkable document originally drafted by Lilburn and
his Leveller followers. A year later, in 1648, it received its final
form at the hands of a sub-committee consisting of an equal number of
soldier delegates, high officers and parliamentary representatives.
It was finally accepted in principle, though in a modified form, by
Cromwell and his &#8216;Grandees&#8217; (as the high officers were called by
the common soldiers). It represented the high tide of the English
Revolutions. It re-asserted the sovereign power of the people to make
and change all laws and demanded the re-election of parliament every
two years. It demanded a form of universal suffrage but did not
include hired labourers on the grounds that this would lead to
corruption. This was due to the fact that there was no secret ballot
and it was thought, therefore, that the hired labourers on farms and
in the few existing small workshops would be open to pressure from
their employers. It insisted on democratic control of the army and
election of officers, for whom civilians would have the right to
vote; complete religious toleration and the abolition of all tithes
and tolls. It also called for an alteration in the laws of land
tenure which would give the yeomen and tenant farmers proprietary
rights over the land they tilled.</p>
<p>There was another important immediate issue raised at these
meetings which was the subject of strongly-worded resolutions and
protests to the government. This was the question of arrears in army
pay. The government was trying to fob the men off with what today
would be called a form of post-war credit. These credit notes were
useless to most of the now impoverished yeomen, small traders and
artisans returning to &#8216;Civvy Street&#8217;. Many ex-servicemen were
forced by poverty to sell these certificates to speculators at a
fraction of their value, and Parliament itself was actually
participating in this mean robbery by employing agents to buy back
its own IOUs at three or four shillings in the pound. This secondary
demand eventually became a focal point of all the Levellers&#8217;
grievances, leading to open revolt, just as in modern times economic
strikes of the working class in defence of living standards have
often led to much more far reaching political revolts.</p>
<p>Most of the troops that marched out of &#8216;Old Sarum&#8217; (Salisbury)
flying their own sea-green colours into the green countryside of an
English spring in 1649 would have attended the great popular
assemblies which had adopted the <em>Agreement of the People</em>.
Those who had not would have been fully conversant with its
principles as with the terms of the famous Engagement. In the period
since the first drafting of the <em>Peoples&#8217; Agreement</em> the
leaders of the movement had written and distributed great numbers of
political pamphlets and tracts to reinforce the original arguments of
the agreement. The regimental agitators had followed this up with
continual verbal propaganda. The Leveller&#8217;s revolt was therefore a
conscious, level-headed and inspired movement, typically English in
its downright and practical methods of organisation; methods which
the English masses have improved upon and extended through the
centuries with increasing success.</p>
<p>An examination of various Leveller pronouncements during the
risings disproves the contention of many orthodox historians that
they were irreconcilable doctrinaires. The printed documents show
that all their actions were the result of reasoned and careful
discussion and they resorted to force only when they found themselves
threatened with violence. Neither must it be thought that the Burford
incident was an isolated one; mutinies on a larger scale had taken
place in widely separated parts of the country. While the revolt at
Salisbury was coming to a head, Cromwell with the very greatest
difficulty, and by means of the most specious promises was preventing
a much larger body of troops from taking similar action in London. In
1647 several regiments had raised the sea-green colours at Ware and
the leaders had been immediately shot. A short time before the
Burford revolt, the City had witnessed a great sea-green
demonstration at the funeral of a Leveller who had been shot in St.
Paul&#8217;s Churchyard for the part he had played in an earlier mutiny.</p>
<p>Those who set out on the fatal march to Burford were well aware of
the price they would have to pay for failure and although traitors,
spies and cowards appeared within their ranks, the degree of unity
and self-discipline they maintained to the end was proof of their
great spirit. That they were betrayed rather than defeated is proved
by an examination of contemporary documents. If they erred, it was in
being over-trusting in their dealings with representatives of the
high command who applied the method of delay until they were ready to
strike in overwhelming strength. It is this battle of manoeuvre,
quite familiar to the industrial worker engaged in strike action,
which we shall now endeavour to describe in detail.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<a name="p3"></a>
<h4>Gathering Storm in Salisbury</h4>
<p class="fst">At the beginning of May 1649, two cavalry regiments were stationed
in Salisbury. The second Civil War was over and Cromwell&#8217;s chief
anxiety was what to do with these turbulent soldiers who had become
infected with the revolutionary ideas of the Levellers. He decided
that the most effective diversion of their militant energies would be
a campaign in Ireland. This would not only divert attention from the
grievances at home, but would also solve the awkward question of
arrears in pay, by providing opportunities for loot and land
settlement in Ireland.</p>
<p>At first this astute move had just the opposite effect to what had
been expected. The soldiers under new and more revolutionary
&#8216;agitators&#8217; (or Commissars as they might be described today)
immediately invoked the famous &#8216;Engagement&#8217; not to disband their
forces until they had obtained justice at home, claiming that this
was a deceitful way of achieving their dispersal. It must be
remembered that Cromwell himself had somewhat reluctantly endorsed
the &#8216;Engagement&#8217;.</p>
<p>The selection of the regiments to proceed to active service in
Ireland was to be arrived at by a lottery organised by the high
officers. The very method adopted would have looked suspicious and
when the lot fell on the two regiments of Colonel Scroop and General
Ireton stationed in Salisbury, the troops immediately declared this
to be an infringement of the 1647 Engagement and refused to go. They
were given the usual harangue on the parade ground, consisting of a
mixture of threats and pleading, whereupon the soldiers drew up a
memorandum called <em>A Paper of Some Reasons, by way of Declaration</em>
and despatched this to Colonel Scroop. In this they were joined by
one of the officers, a certain Cornet (sub-lieutenant) Dene who
pushed himself quickly to the front as an advocate of extreme
revolutionary methods, until the time of the final crisis, when he
revealed himself as a type the modern working class movement has
become very familiar with.</p>
<p>Their views having been presented to the Colonel, the troops were
called to a rendezvous by the officers and were told that no-one was
to be forced to go to Ireland, but that those who did not wish to go
could take their discharge and leave the army at once. This sounds a
simple solution, but it was in fact a cunning attempt to throw
confusion into the minds of the men, for it meant that if they stayed
at home all chance of getting their arrears of pay would be gone, and
if they went abroad the solidarity of the rank and file would be
broken and the whole movement for post-war justice would collapse.
When they refused to adopt either course but acted as one body,
Colonel Scroop (who seems to have been an &#8216;ultra-blimp&#8217;, even in
the opinion of his fellow officers) informed the men in strong terms
that they were already guilty of mutiny. An ironical note is added by
the fact that when the Colonel was asked whether he would go to
Ireland, he replied that he himself could give no assurance that he
would go.</p>
<p>After this Colonel Scroop&#8217;s regiment at once sent a letter to
the troops under General Ireton who then decided to join the original
mutineers. After further threats, Colonel Scroop ordered all the
horses to be placed some two miles from the men&#8217;s quarters. This
order the men carried out, proving that there was as yet no
repudiation of discipline and that the men were still only standing
on what they considered their Constitutional rights and remaining
true to the engagement undertaken by the whole army, including
Cromwell himself. However, when it became evident that the Colonel
was preparing to use force against them, the men regained their
horses and began to make preparations to defend themselves if
attacked. Whether the officers were actually disobeyed and driven
away is not clear. The survivors of the Burford battle afterwards
published a pamphlet in defence of their actions. This states that
the officers themselves left the regiment, and the men then elected
new officers. There seems to be some indication that the infamous
Cornet Dene who joined the mutineers urged violence against his
ex-colleagues. From the moment of the re-election of officers, of
course, the die was cast and the whole incident may best be told in
the words of some of those who survived:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;Our old solemn Engagement at Newmarket and Thriplow
Heath, June 5th, 1647, with the manifold Declarations, Promises and
Protestations of the Army, in pursuance thereof, were all utterly
declined and most Perfidiously broken, and the whole fabric of the
Commonwealth fell into the grossest and vilest tyranny that ever
Englishmen groaned under ... which, with the considerations of the
particular, most insufferable abuses and dissatisfactions put upon
us, moved us to an unanimous refusal to go ... till full satisfaction
and security was given to us as Soldiers and Commoners, by a Council
of our own free election ... Whereupon we drew up a paper of some
Reasons, by way of Declaration, concerning our said refusal to
deliver to our Colonel; unto which we all cheerfully subscribed, with
many of our officers (especially Cornet Dene, who then seemingly was
extreme forward in assisting us to effect our desires) which being
delivered a day or two after, immediately our officers called a
rendez-vous near under Salisbury, where they declared that the
General intended not to force us, but that we might either go or
stay, and so certifying our intents to stay, we were all drawn into
the town again, and the Colonel together with the rest of the
officers, full of discontent, threatened us the Soldiers, and because
we were all, or most of one mind, he termed our unity a Combination
or Mutiny, yet himself upon our request to know, told us, that he
could not assure us, that he would go. Which forementioned paper,
with a letter, we sent to Commissary General Ireton&#8217;s Regiment, who
took it so well, that they were immediately upon their march towards
our quarters to joyn with us.&#8221;</em><br/>

<h4>To Banbury to Join Forces</h4>
<p class="fst">Having drawn up a further <em>Declaration of Aims</em> and
despatched it to Generals Fairfax and Cromwell, the two regiments,
which numbered over a thousand men, had to decide on their future
tactics and strategy. This must have constituted a serious problem
for the leaders. It is doubtful whether they would have known much
about the threatening disturbances that were taking place among the
much larger bodies of the London troops. News, which today spreads
over the land in a few minutes, would have taken two or three days to
reach Salisbury from London. They would know, of course that feeling
was very strong and that similar movements were likely elsewhere, but
that is all. Few of them would even have heard of the more
thoroughgoing communist and civilian arm of the Levellers&#8217;
movement, which, in that very spring of 1649, was making the first
attempt to occupy land in the name of the people and cultivate it
along co-operative lines. They therefore decided to strike for the
town of Banbury from which they had received indisputable information
that a similar mutiny to their own had taken place.</p>
<p>These troops, under an NCO by the name of William Thompson, were
at the same time declaring their solidarity in a powerfully worded
manifesto of their own. This refers to the news they had received
from Salisbury in the following terms:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;We do own and avow the late proceedings in Col.
Scroop&#8217;s, Col. Harrison&#8217;s and Major General Skippon&#8217;s
regiments, declared in their resolutions published in print; as one
man resolving to live and dy with them in their and our just and
mutual defences.&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="fst">In view of this information, the leaders who constituted a
regimental committee decided to make a junction with their comrades
at Banbury. This would involve a stiff march across country much
rougher than it is today and would include a great part of the
Cotswolds, a distance of over fifty miles. Once such a junction had
been made, a force of nearly three thousand cavalry would have been
able to take the field. This would have made a formidable force, and
using Banbury as a centre it could have reasonably expected to hold
out for some time. If threatened by overwhelming forces it could have
retreated into the Cotswolds.</p>
<p>Assuming that the leadership was made up in the main of those who
were eventually executed in Burford churchyard, the Military
Committee probably consisted of about six men, the most prominent of
these being Cornet Dene, ex-regular officer, Cornet Thompson (brother
of the Banbury leader) and Corporal Perkins and Private Church. The
two latter ordinary soldiers were the most stable and courageous
leaders remaining constant and incorruptible to the end, although
less vociferous than the others.</p>
<p>On May 11th the Salisbury regiments struck across Salisbury Plain.
They rode hard as they had heard that Cromwell and Fairfax were
already on the move, and had reached Andover. From Andover Cromwell
dispatched four officers to catch up with the mutineers. These
officers were supposed to discuss terms with the mutineers, but it
seems probable that they were actually dispatched for tactical
reasons and that their real orders were to delay the rebels as long
as possible and so give Cromwell and Fairfax time to get within
striking distance. They made several attempts to involve the
Levellers in long-winded discussions and, although the men were not
inclined to listen to them, these contacts must have reduced the
speed of the advance.</p>
<p>Cromwell&#8217;s agents first made contact with the main body at
Wantage late in the evening of May 12th. They evidently met with a
rebuff but were promised an interview at Stanford in the Vale the
next morning. This meeting was also abortive, apparently because the
men&#8217;s old Colonel, the detested Scroop suddenly appeared, and the
Levellers moved on to Abingdon. Again the officers rather
ignominiously trailed along behind the troops. At Abingdon the men
would have no dealings with Scroop but agreed to parley with the
other four officers. One of these, Major White, made a speech in
which he spoke of the need for army unity to save the Commonwealth
and concluded by reading a letter from Fairfax and Cromwell. This had
little effect on the men who believed that it was the salvation of
the Commonwealth that made their present fight necessary. Most of
their national leaders, men of great courage like Lilburn and
Overton, were imprisoned in the Tower of London. These men had fought
in every notable battle for the Commonwealth and had given
unconditional loyalty to Cromwell until the end of the Civil War.
Lilburn, in particular, had distinguished himself; he had been
wounded several times and risen to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
The soldiers now saw him as the only public man willing to fight for
a genuinely democratic Commonwealth instead of a dictatorship of the
high generals and the City of London merchant princes.</p>
<p>The Levellers had decided to proceed to Banbury via Abingdon &#8211; a
most roundabout route &#8211; owing to information that the troops of
Colonel Harrison would probably join their ranks near that town. They
now proceeded in this direction, with Major White and two officers
still following. Colonel Scotten, to use the mutineers&#8217; own words
<em>&#8216;slipped away&#8217;</em> to give Cromwell news of their next
destination. In the pamphlet <strong>The Levellers Vindicated</strong> it
appears that many of the men saw through these tactics, as the
following extract from the original document indicates:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;Being in treatie with the commissioners, and having
intelligence that the General and the Lt. General were upon their
march towards us, many of us several times urged to Major White that
he came to betray us, to which he replyed, that the General and the
Lt. General had engaged their honours not to engage us in any Hostile
manner till they had received our answer ... We gave the more credit
to them who seemed extreme forward and hastie to make the composeure,
pretending so far to improve of our standing for the things contained
in our arrangement at TriploHeath, that himself with our consents
drew up a Paper or Answer to the General for us ... During this time
of treatie while the commissioners thus assured us all security, one
of them, the Colonel Scotten privately slips from us, and two others,
Captains Bayley and Peverill, left notes at every town of our
strength and condition ...&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="fst">Had Major White and his talkative officers been sent packing after
the first contact, it is very doubtful whether Cromwell could have
destroyed the Levellers by his final surprise attack at Burford. The
success of his plan clearly depended on precise information as to the
position of the mutineers. It is true that his travelling speed of
forty or fifty miles a day was remarkable, but it was the exact
knowledge of the point reached by the Levellers, that enabled him to
catch them at Burford with a large body of troops.</p>
<p>In spite of Major White&#8217;s protestations spoken at the time and
put in writing later, it is obvious that he created an effective
intelligence service under the guise of being an emissary to discuss
honourable terms.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<a name="p5"></a>
<h3>Treachery at Burford</h3>
<p class="fst">Just outside Abingdon the expected meeting with Colonel Harrison&#8217;s
troops took place. Delegates were sent by the Salisbury regiments,
who read out their declaration. This was favourably received by
Harrison&#8217;s men who stated that they were marching to quarters at
Thame, and in the morning would communicate their decision. Before
the two bodies separated, however, the first brush with some of
Fairfax&#8217;s reconnaissance troops took place, which thanks to Major
White, must have still further delayed progress to Banbury. These
hostile troops &#8211; not more than a hundred in number &#8211; placed
themselves astride a bridge at Newbridge. These troops could have
been routed probably without loss of life, but Major White persuaded
the Levellers not to force a crossing, pleading that they should not
be the first to shed blood in a new war. As a result the Salisbury
men withdrew and were compelled to ford the river at another point a
considerable distance away &#8211; a difficult and delaying operation.</p>
<p>It was now growing late on Sunday May 13th. The troops had already
travelled from Wantage; they were tired and wet after fording the
river. The question of quarters for the night was becoming an urgent
problem. The decision was left to Lieutenant Ray and &#8211; Cornet Dene,
who decided to proceed a further fifteen miles to Burford. This would
have appeared satisfactory to the men, as being well on the way to
their comrades at Banbury. Further, Burford had a solidly parliament
reputation during the Civil War. It was a centre of the wool clothing
industry and the population would probably be sympathetic. From this
town had come Lenthall, the speaker of the House of Commons, which
had resisted the King when he had attempted to impose his will on
Parliament on the eve of the Civil War.</p>
<p>Some time after dark, fifteen hundred grim and exhausted Leveller
horsemen entered Burford and proceeded to find suitable quarters and
billets for a night&#8217;s sleep. The little grey-stoned Cotswold town
was not large enough to shelter so large a body of men and many had
to go to surrounding villages. Arrangements were unfortunately left
in the hands of Cornet Dene who appointed a fellow traitor,
Quartermaster Moore to organise the guard. This he did in a very
casual way, and then, pretending to be going for refreshments left
the town, returning some hours later at the head of the General&#8217;s
forces to strike down his ex-comrades.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Major White, who was still accepted as a genuine
intermediary between the Levellers and the High Command, was exerting
all his eloquence to convince them that Cromwell and Fairfax had
pledged their honour not to attack at least until they had received
and considered the communication which the men had sent them. Major
White even asserted that if hostile forces arrived he himself would
go out and stand between the bullets and the Levellers.</p>
<p>It must be admitted that Major White afterwards denied any
treacherous intentions in thus endeavouring to lull the vigilance of
the men. It is, of course, possible that he was that type of
would-be-pacifist who was really deceiving himself as well as the
Levellers. Against this must be set the fact that several of the
NCO&#8217;s were ordinary paid agents of the High Command, and it seems
likely that Major White was in continual contact with them. It is
also significant that on his own admission, the professional &#8216;stooge&#8217;
Cornet Dene was with the Major at his quarters a few minutes before
the Fairfax troops broke into the town.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the truth about Major White&#8217;s conscience, the
effect of his activity was to create a false atmosphere of relative
security just at the moment when the greatest danger was threatening.
Believing Fairfax and Cromwell to be at least a day&#8217;s march away
(Major White must have certainly known better) the men settled down
without much apprehension.</p>
<p>At midnight Cromwell&#8217;s hand-picked cavalry burst into the quiet
little town with muskets firing and swords drawn. The Levellers had
little choice either of putting up an effective fight or of
surrendering without resistance. In the confusion of the darkness
each man was forced to defend himself as best he could. Only at one
point was an organised resistance put up. A small party of Levellers
barricaded themselves into an Inn (probably the Bull), maintaining a
brief but stout defence, during which they suffered several
casualties, one man being shot dead. After this all resistance was at
an end. Several hundred Levellers escaped into the surrounding
countryside, but three hundred and forty were captured and imprisoned
in Burford Church.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<a name="p6"></a>
<h4>Retribution</h4>
<p class="fst">Cromwell now began a deliberate and methodical campaign to break
the morale of those who had previously proved implacable. He aimed
not only to force the mutineers to renounce their previous views, but
also to deprive the Levellers of public sympathy by presenting their
actions in the most unfavourable light. He therefore did not order
immediate executions but subjected the mutineers to a &#8216;war of
nerves&#8217; by keeping them locked up in the old church for the best
part of a week. This would have been a period of intense anxiety, as
for a long time no information was given them as to their fate. It
was during this long vigil, while the men were left to reflect on all
that had happened since they began their struggle at Salisbury, that
one of the troopers roughly carved his name on the lead lining of the
ancient font. Thus the words &#8216;ANTHONY SEDLEY 1649 PRISNER&#8217; became
the only inscription to commemorate the last stand of the Levellers.
Thousands must have stood before this font unaware of its grim
significance, yet these crude letters mark the historical turning
point of the first great social revolution in England. It was not
until three hundred years later that the common people were able to
realise most of the political ideas for which Anthony Sedley fought
in 1649, while true economic emancipation is yet to be achieved.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the imprisonment, the Colonels Harris, Okey and
Scroop were sent into the church to inform the prisoners that there
would be a general death sentence. It is improbable that it was ever
intended to carry this out, but by these means Cromwell hoped to
bring about their humble contrition, which would be very useful to
him in his effort to dissipate all national sympathy for the
Levellers. It would seem that his methods met with some success and
it was claimed that the men drew up a petition beginning with the
words: <em>&#8216;The humble petition of the sad and heavy hearted
prisoners remaining in Burford Church.&#8217;</em> This certainly looks
sufficiently contrite. Whether more than a small minority signed this
wordy plea is, however, an open question. Corporal Perkins proudly
averred his beliefs at the execution wall and it would be reasonable
to assume that his example influenced most of the others. It is most
likely that the petition was the work of Cornet Dene and that during
the last hours of confinement the mutineers were split into two factions.</p>
<p>Finally, after much hesitation, Cromwell selected four alleged
ringleaders for execution, leaving the others still in suspense.
These were Cornet Dene, Cornet Thompson, Private Church and Corporal Perkins.</p>
<p>Before the executions the whole body of Levellers were ordered to
a position where the executions could easily be seen, some being
placed on the roof of the church for this purpose. Cornet Thompson
was the first to be taken to the churchyard wall. He did not die too
well. The rank and file afterwards maintained that he had expected a
pardon at the last moment, and for this reason repeatedly proclaimed
his penitence. The conduct of the two common soldiers was a great
contrast to this. Corporal Perkins proudly avowed the part he had
played and his belief in the cause for which he was dying, and his
actual death is most vividly described in a contemporary news-sheet
in the following terms:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;Corporal Perkins was the next &#8211; the place of
death and the sight of his execution was so far from altering his
countenance or daunting his spirit that he seemed to smile upon both,
and account it a great mercy that he was to die for this quarrel, and
casting his eye up to his father and afterwards to his fellow
prisoners (who stood upon the church leads to see the execution) set
his back against the wall and bade the executioners shoot.&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="fst">Thus in his death Corporal Perkins saved the honour of the
Levellers movement and bequeathed to the common people a name which
down the centuries they would be able to honour and revere. Private
Church died equally bravely but without making a clear-cut statement,
and in the words of a contemporary document &#8220;after taking off his
doublet he took his place a pretty distance from the wall&#8221; thus
confirming his lack of fear.</p>
<p>The last to be brought to the execution wall was Cornet Dene, and
the nearer the moment of the execution, the more hypocritical became
his mode of expression. It was even asserted by the surviving
mutineers that he had previously bought his own winding street. In
his statement he continually harped on the remorse that he felt for
the bad ways into which he had led the other mutineers, and then
after he had commended his penitent soul to the mercy of the Lord, an
officer came forward with a last minute pardon, which was no surprise
to most of those in his unfortunate audience.</p>
<p>Having witnessed these executions, the Levellers were taken back
to the church, where Cromwell &#8211; no doubt using the pulpit for the
purpose &#8211; proceeded to deliver a sermon. This must have been a
distressing experience. Cromwell had always been given to long
rambling speeches, often difficult to listen to in the best of
circumstances. The speech was, of course, liberally sprinkled with
religious references. The official historians wish us to believe that
all this had the desired effect. However, the story afterwards told
by the survivors hardly supports this claim, for they describe his
remarks as being in <em>&#8216;his old manner of dissembling speeches&#8217;</em>.</p>
<p>To complete the men&#8217;s discomfiture, Cornet Dene was then
compelled to preach to the men on the need to repent their sins. If
some may have seriously listened to Cromwell because they still felt
respect for him as their old war leader, it is impossible to believe
that they would have listened to Dene with anything but scorn in
their hearts, and in their pamphlet they certainly leave no doubt
about their feelings for him:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;And to put an utter inconfidence and Jealousie for
ever amongst such upon all future engagements, they made that
wretched Judas Dene to that end their pandor and slave. They enjoyned
Dene to preach apostacy to us in the pulpit of Burford Church to
assert and plead the unlawfulness of our engagement, as much as
before the lawfulness to vindicate those wicked and abominable
proceedings of the General ... howling and weeping like a Crocadile,
and to make him a perfect rogue and villain upon everlasting record.&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="fst">After his release Dene continued to be used by the authorities as
a propaganda tool, and he was compelled to write a pamphlet along the
same lines as his hypocritical recantations at Burford. This was
broadcast throughout the land. Naturally Dene eventually received a
greater reward than the mere granting of his life, and a few years
later we find him well established as a preacher at Fenstanton in the
county of Huntingdonshire. Here some of his Baptist and Quaker
parishioners were imprisoned for refusing to take the oath and
characteristically, it is reported that he made every effort to
induce them to forsake their religious principles in this respect.</p>
<p>After the public execution the remainder of the mutineers were
drafted to Devizes, and the magistrates in all counties were ordered
to issue warrants against all those that had escaped. During his
sermonising in Burford Church Cromwell had made some vague promises
that the Leveller&#8217;s original grievances would be rectified, but a
short time after their arrival at Devizes the regiments concerned
were disbanded. Shortly after the collapse of the Levellers at
Burford, their comrades whom they had failed to reach at Banbury,
were defeated after a short battle in the streets of the town. The
Banbury leader had been William Thompson, a brother of the one
executed at Burford. Unlike his brother he died fighting, killing
three men before he himself was shot in a wood near Banbury.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<a name="p7"></a>
<h4>Aftermath</h4>
<p class="fst">With the collapse of the Levellers&#8217; revolt at Burford, the whole
movement began to disintegrate. The unity and cohesion of the
Levellers was mainly the result of the close-knit type of
organisation, only possible within the army which brought them
together. The new bourgeois state was now becoming consolidated and
with the gradual disbandment of the more militant army units, the
Levellers found themselves isolated. Most of them were small
independent tradesmen, tenants, farmers, artisans and some casual
labourers. Their mode of existence did not reunite them in civilian
life in large industrial enterprises as is the case with the modern
working class. Once outside the army, economic necessity forced them
back to an isolated petit-bourgeois way of earning their livelihoods
which made effective mass organisation impossible.</p>
<p>Further, the old feudal class and the new merchant capitalists
were rapidly patching up their quarrel and this compromise was firmly
consolidated with the re-establishment of a new bourgeois monarchy.
In this way the ruling class erected a durable barrier against any
further social revolution which lasted until our own times.</p>
<p>While it is just conceivable that the Levellers might have seized
power for a short time, they could not have prevented the
establishment of a capitalist Britain. As Marx later pointed out to
the early working class movement of the last century: <em>&#8220;Man makes
his own history but only within certain limits.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>These limits are set by the level of development of the productive
forces of a given epoch. Only if those revolutionary soldiers could
have linked with a great mass movement of the people would it have
been possible to set up a genuinely democratic republic. No heavy
industry existed, no large scale factories had yet been built, no
widespread and rapid system of transport had developed and,
therefore, the proletarian had not yet appeared on the historical
scene. Since none of these necessary economic conditions yet existed,
a Levellers&#8217; government could have done little to change the march
of events.</p>
<p>A hundred and fifty years later the Jacobins actually succeeded in
seizing power in revolutionary France, but in spite of their
revolutionary measures, it was the big industrialists and bankers who
eventually gained the upper hand because, here too, no industrial
proletariat yet existed powerful enough to play an independent
political role in the struggle for power.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<a name="p8"></a>
<h4>Today</h4>
<p class="fst">Today capitalism, long past its heyday, has created just those
social and economic conditions which were absent in England in 1649,
and in 1789 in France, and for several decades the industrial
proletariat has been in a position to succeed where the Levellers
failed. Already in 1917 the Russian workers utilising the
revolutionary experience of the common people in the West were able
to overthrow their own absolute monarchy and capitalist class. It is
true that owing to the rise of the Stalinist bureaucracy and the long
delay in the socialist revolution in the West, the Russian workers
have not gained the full fruits of the October Revolution.
Nevertheless it did lay the economic basis upon which a genuine
socialist society can be built once the bureaucratic caste now in
control there has been removed. Petrograd 1917 did in fact mark the
beginning of a World revolution even though it was delayed much
longer than Lenin had calculated. Today there is worldwide evidence
that the revolutionary wave is once again gathering speed.</p>
<p>In England, capitalism is forced to lean on the opportunism of the
right-wing Labour leaders, but they cannot prevent the continued
decline of capitalism, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for
them to hold back the workers with talk about the &#8216;Middle Road to
Socialism&#8217;. They overlook the fact that for many years the workers
of the world have been marching along the right road to socialism, in
overwhelming strength. The bourgeois historians give every support to
the Cult of the &#8216;Middle Road&#8217; (in reality the road back for the
workers) by the careful cultivation of the theory that it accords
with the historical traditions of the British people. This is the
reason why they have devoted but a few pages to the revolutionary
movement of the Levellers and whole volumes to the so-called
&#8216;Glorious Revolution&#8217; of 1688 which established the
constitutional Monarchy. Of course the real revolution took place
fifty years earlier in the course of which King Charles lost his head
and the common people began their long march to freedom.</p>
<p>The revolutionary social theories expressed by men like Lilburn
and the more nearly socialist philosopher Winstanley established a
tradition of militant struggle, the continuity of which can be traced
throughout the three centuries of English history that have passed
since the execution of Corporal Perkins in Burford Churchyard. In the
same way the revolutionary thoughts and actions of these Englishmen
inspired the revolutionary thoughts and actions of the common people
in other lands. The great leaders of the French Revolution were
indirectly inspired by the writings as well as the deeds of these
English revolutionaries of the 17th Century, just as many of the
political demands made by the Levellers were inscribed on the banners
of the English Chartist workers a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Today the modern working class movement, and the Marxist wing of
the movement in particular, are the true heirs to this great
tradition of militant struggle against the exploiting classes.</p>
<p>We cannot claim that the Levellers ever adopted a clear-cut
socialist theory; on the contrary their ideas were often vague and
confused, but armed with the scientific theory of social development
&#8211; the theory of Marxism &#8211; socialism will eventually realise those
ideas towards which the Levellers were groping.</p>
<p>There is no recorded link between the army movement of the
Levellers and the more socialist movement of the so-called Diggers
which was led by Gerald Winstanley. Lilburn and many of his followers
repudiated Winstanley and denied any wish to interfere with private
property. Nevertheless, Winstanley described himself as a &#8216;True
Leveller&#8217; and appealed to the soldiers for support, and it would be
logical to believe that some of the rank and file would have
sympathised with his ideas. Many of the common soldiers were
impoverished or dispossessed yeomen, artisans and landless labourers
who would have approved of Winstanley&#8217;s plan to take over all
uncultivated land in the name of the people. Indeed, when soldiers
were sent to eject the &#8216;Diggers&#8217; from the land they had occupied
at St. George&#8217;s Hill, Surrey, the authorities had great difficulty
in inducing the troops to take any action against these primitive
collective farmers, and there is little doubt that Winstanley was
voicing ideas which were beginning to dawn in the minds of the common people.</p>
<p>In his great work <strong>The Law of Freedom the True Leveller</strong>
Gerard Winstanley clearly defines the only conditions in which a
really free society is possible:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;The storehouses shall be every Man&#8217;s substance
and not any one&#8217;s ... He or she who calls the earth his and not his
brother&#8217;s shall be sat upon a stool with those words written on his
forehead before all the congregation, and afterwards be made a
servant for twelve months under the taskmaster. If he quarrel or seek
by secret persuasion or open rising to set up such a kingly property
he shall be put to death.&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="fst">Thus would this typical Englishman have dealt with those who by
force or by cunning would seek a return to so-called &#8216;free
enterprise&#8217;. On capitalist trade and speculation his ideas are
equally stern:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;If any do buy or sell the earth or the fruits
thereof, unless it be with strangers or another nation according to
the Laws of Navigation, they shall be both put to death as traitors
to the peace of the Commonwealth.&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="fst">Exceedingly harsh measures perhaps; if they were included in the
programme of the Labour Party the capitalist press would call this
further evidence of &#8216;Bolshevik ruthlessness and the alien political
ideology of the Communists&#8217;. Would it not he nearer the truth to
say that, when the Bolsheviks adopted similar methods in 1917 against
the ex-landlords, White Guards and grain speculators, they were
influenced by the ideas of these revolutionary Englishmen of the 17th Century?</p>
<p>Today the right-wing Labour leaders and others tell us how
necessary it is to preserve an opposition of big-business and
anti-socialists in Parliament. This is supposed to be &#8220;protection
of the rights of the minority&#8221;, meaning, of course, the rights of
the minority of property-owners against the commonwealth. No more apt
answer could be given than the words of Winstanley written three
centuries ago:</p>
<p class="quoteb"><em>&#8220;Everyone talks of freedom, and the actors for
freedom are oppressed by the talkers for freedom ... It is clearly
seen, that if we be suffered to speak we shall batter to pieces all
the old laws and prove the maintainers of them hypocrites and
traitors to the commonwealth of England ... Wherever there is a
people united by common community of livelihood into oneness it will
be the strongest land in the world for there they will be as one man
to defend their inheritance.&#8221;</em></p>
<p class="fst">In making this quotation from Winstanley, we do not mean to say
that we favour only one-party government. Lenin never declared in
principle for the elimination of all other parties or factions. Only
the terrorist methods of the White Guard and the old landlord
capitalist class forced the Bolsheviks to counterattack when these
elements threatened to destroy the infant Soviet State by violence,
sabotage and foreign intervention. Similarly, Cromwell was forced to
establish for a time a one party dictatorship when the monarchy
threatened a second Civil War and the importation of foreign troops
to destroy the new state which Parliament had created. In Soviet
Russia Lenin insisted until right up to his death that democratic
forms of rule including tolerance of a legal opposition should be
restored once the threat of violence had been removed. Contrary to
Lenin&#8217;s wishes, Stalin developed these temporary measures into a
permanent form to support his own &#8220;dictatorial&#8221; rule.</p>
<p>These noble words of Winstanley must therefore be seen in relation
to the bitter Civil War which had been raging. The execution of
Charles I finally came about as a result of positive proof that he
was preparing to bring in Irish and French troops to over-throw the
will of his own people and also because his person constituted a
rallying point around which counter-revolutionary forces continually
grouped. Cromwell himself did not set out to establish one-party
government, but only suppressed the opposition when the Commonwealth
could not be preserved in any other way. He turned and destroyed the
Levellers for the same reason. From his viewpoint they were a threat
to the only kind of social order that could effectively replace the
absolute monarchy which he had overthrown &#8211; a system wherein the
new ruling class, the men of property and trade, would be free to
develop the economy of the country in accordance with their own
interest, unhampered by arbitrary feudal rights and privileges
previously used against them by the king and the nobility. Cromwell
no doubt was right in insisting that this rule of the men of commerce
and property was the only alternative to chaos. But let us remember
that in the light of man&#8217;s age-long struggle for full political and
economic freedom, Winstanley, Lilburn and the simple Leveller
soldiers also stood for the brighter future of mankind.</p>

<h3>Author&#8217;s Postscript</h3>
<p class="fst">I have been asked to give a brief bibliography and also explain
how a layman and active Trade Unionist who was a member of the Oxford
District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union during and
just after the Second World War came to be interested in the doings
of our Leveller forefathers 300 years previously.</p>
<p>The bibliography is extremely easy to provide. Almost all the
material on which the story of the brief battle at Burford is based
can be found in the local history archives of the Oxford City
Library. Most of the quotations from Leveller pamphlets are also
included in this material. I merely wrote this up in what I hope was
a more interesting and gripping manner. Some quotations from
Winstanley and from other anonymous pamphleteers during the
Cromwellian period can be found in the works of Christopher Hill who
I believe to be the outstanding historian of this period in Britain
today. Most of Winstanley&#8217;s views and those of many other radical
thinkers can be found quoted in great detail in Christopher Hill&#8217;s
books <strong>Puritanism and Revolution</strong>, and <strong>The Reformation to
Industrial Revolution</strong>, and many other works on different aspects
of the English Civil War period.</p>
<p>I wrote this pamphlet in 1947&#8211;8 when, after the honeymoon with
Stalinist Russia during the Second World War, the mass media were
once again portraying communism as everything that was alien to the
<em>&#8216;true spirit&#8217;</em> of the British nation &#8211; a purely foreign
importation. As a passionate young follower of the history of British
socialism I was convinced that the insinuation that the communist
idea had no roots in our own history was essentially false.</p>
<p>Therefore I felt the need to show that when those emotive words
<em>&#8216;our national heritage&#8217;</em> are used by the representatives of
capitalist society, the aim is to blot out that other heritage &#8211;
the heritage of the common people. I wanted to show that for hundreds
of years, indeed, from the days of Wat Tyler&#8217;s peasant revolt, the
labouring masses have always fought against the establishment of the day.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact communist ideas were prevalent among the
common people long before the USSR or even Karl Marx were heard of. I
believed therefore that it is this heritage that must be revived. The
story of the Levellers is just one incident in the age-long struggle
of the rank and file to change society. The official historians have
buried such incidents as the battle at Burford under great files of
dry as dust manuscripts. The uncovering of these revolutionary
struggles will become an inspiration to the working-class movement to
realise those ideas which were seen by the old pioneers as &#8216;through
a glass darkly&#8217;.</p>

<h3>Footnote</h3>
<p class="note"><a href="#f1" name="n1">1.</a> There was a curious pamphlet called
<strong>Terrible and bloudy Newes from the disloyall Army in the North</strong>
with a picture on the title page of soldiers impaling babies on
spears and swinging them up to dash out their brains. It proceeds to
relate the terror of the inhabitants of Market Harborough when some
Levellers arrived in the town on market day &#8211; they ran hither and
thither in fright. But the only facts to be related when it comes to
the point are that the Levellers proclaimed that there was nothing to
be afraid of, <em>&#8216;stayed awhile at the Crown and so departed
peacefully&#8217;</em>. Evidently some methods of modern journalism are
not new.</p>
