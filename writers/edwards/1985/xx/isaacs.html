<p class="fst"><strong>The Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution</strong> (3rd edition)<br/>
by Harold R. Isaacs<br/>
<em>Stanford University Press, &#0163;8.95</em></p>
<p class="fst">This third edition of <strong>The Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution</strong>
makes valuable reading for anyone wishing to understand Chinese
history in the 20th Century and also to know why the long drawn out
revolution in that country culminated in a Stalinist dictatorship.</p>
<p>However this third edition is inferior to the first edition
published in 1938 which is now unfortunately out of print and very
difficult to come by. This revised edition is inferior because in
1938 the author wrote from a genuinely Marxist and revolutionary
standpoint but abandoned this position in the period between the
publication of the first edition in 1938 and the second edition in 1951.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that in the second and third editions the
author eliminated the original introduction by Leon Trotsky in which
the original work was warmly endorsed. The author endeavours to
explain this in his new prefaces to the second and third editions,
but only succeeds in explaining his own confusion.</p>
<p>Although by 1951 the author has forsaken the basic Marxist
position of Trotsky, the book still gives an extraordinary factual
account of the false and opportunist policies foisted on the Chinese
communists between 1925 and 1927. The fatal nature of these Stalinist
policies for the Chinese workers is clearly demonstrated in the
numerous quotations given from the official documents of the
Communist International and from statements made by Stalin himself.</p>
<p>Despite his loss of faith in Marxist theory the author does not
deny the truth of Trotsky&#8217;s analysis and indeed is compelled to say
in his preface to the revised editions:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;He (Trotsky) predicted with startling precision every
turn of events as it took place. His analysis and criticisms of the
official course were confirmed again and again by the evidence which
this work examines in detail. <em>This is a fact that is not altered by passage of time, or again by shifts
in a writers outlook.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The value of this book for socialists therefore lies in the
enormous accumulation of factual evidence therein. It clearly shows
that the young Chinese working class movement which sprang up with
enormous speed and power after the First World War was torpedoed by
the opportunist tactics of Stalin, who through the Executive
Committee of the Communist International succeeded in dominating the
very new and inexperienced Chinese Communist Party.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Kuomintang slaughter workers</h4>
<p class="fst">The tactics put forward by Stalin, Bukharin and other Stalinist
functionaries were based on the idea of dissolving the organisational
independence and political programme of the Chinese Communist Party
into a bloc with the Kuomintang, the political organisation of the
Chinese national bourgeoisie. This meant that by keeping their &#8220;heads
down&#8221; and soft-pedalling on any kind of socialist programme &#8211; by
discouraging the peasants from taking over the land and refraining
from any action which would antagonise the landlords or capitalists &#8211;
the workers would be able to come out on top when the Nationalist
revolution, led by the native capitalists, was completed.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact the Kuomintang under Chiang Kai Chek was
totally incapable of completing the National Bourgeois Revolution
because it remained under the financial domination of the Western
Powers even after they handed over to Chiang Kai Chek the territorial
concessions they had previously wrung out of China by military force.
The only way that the national revolution would be completed was by
the rapid carrying through of radical land reform which handed over
to the peasants the vast areas owned by the Chinese landlords. This
the landlords and the weak Chinese capitalists were unwilling to do.
They were dependent on the huge loans provided by the western bankers
and financiers. And as soon as they saw that Chiang Kai Chek intended
to destroy the great movement of the workers and peasants, the
British, American, French and Belgian capitalists gave him their
support in return for being allowed to maintain their financial
domination in Shanghai, Hankow, Canton and other trading cities.</p>
<p>The tactics of appeasing the native bourgeois, who were in the
pockets of Western Imperialism, was therefore the exact opposite of
the Bolshevik strategy worked out by Lenin on the eve of the October
Revolution in 1917. It amounted to a switch over to the policy
advocated by the right wing Mensheviks who said that the Russian
labour movement should trail along behind the Liberals and make no
bid for power until a capitalist &#8220;democracy&#8221; had been established
in Russia; to which proposition they added the proviso that at some
indefinite period in the future the labour movement would then be
able to enter into a contest with the capitalist ruling class through
Western style parliamentary democracy. This policy recommended to the
Chinese Communists in 1927 by the Stalinist Executive of the
Communist International was a repudiation of Lenin&#8217;s tactics which
for the first time in history had brought the working class to power.</p>
<p>This confused &#8220;Two Stage&#8221; theory, manufactured by the
Stalinists for China in 1927, subsequently became the official
doctrine of the Communist Parties throughout the world, with
disastrous results for the organised working class as well as the
peasants. The Left Opposition took a completely opposite point of
view, warning that such a policy of class collaboration would lead
the working class of China to disaster and result in the massacre of
all the best cadres of the working class, which although still a
minority was, in 1927 growing and fighting with immense vitality.</p>
<p>Once Chiang Kai Chek entered the great city of Shanghai he did
indeed turn on the workers; the very same workers who had already
taken over the city and who had greeted Chiang Kai Chek&#8217;s troops.
Within 48 hours he ordered his troops to massacre many thousands of
militant workers in the streets.</p>
<p>As a young man at the time I well remember the photographs brought
back to Britain by merchant seamen and others. These pictures
depicted the numerous summary decapitations carried out by axemen in
the streets of Shanghai.</p>
<p>On 21 April 1927, scarcely a month after the coup in Shanghai, the
Russian <strong>Pravda</strong> published Stalin&#8217;s Thesis to the Executive
Committee of the Communist International. This was entitled: <em>The
Questions of the Chinese Revolution</em>. Stalin began by saying:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;... the line laid down was the correct line ... This
was the line of close co-operation of the left wingers and Communists
within the Kuomintang, of consolidation of the unity of the
Kuomintang ... of making use of the Right, of their connections and
their experience so far as they submitted to the discipline of the
Kuomintang ...&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">This, scarcely a month after the lower grade CP officials and
trade unionists in Shanghai were murdered in the streets by the
forces of this very same Kuomintang!</p>
<p>Trotsky replied to Stalin in <em>The Chinese Revolution and the
Thesis of Comrade Stalin</em> in May (his answers were never printed
in <strong>Pravda</strong> nor anywhere else):</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We know very well how the bourgeoisie submitted to
&#8216;discipline&#8217; and how the proletariat utilised the Rights, that is
the big and middle bourgeoisie, their &#8216;connections&#8217; (with the
imperialists) and their &#8216;experience&#8217; (in strangling and shooting
the workers). The story of this &#8216;utilisation&#8217; is written in the
book of the Chinese revolution with letters of blood. But this does
not prevent the theses (Stalin&#8217;s theses &#8211; <em>DE</em>) from saying:
&#8216;The subsequent events fully confirmed the correctness of this
line.&#8217; Further than this no one can go!&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">Stalin went on to say that the slogan of the soviets was therefore
inadmissible because it would mean &#8220;issuing the slogan of a fight
against the existing power in this territory (in Wuhan, where the
government was in the hands of the &#8216;left&#8217; Kuomintang &#8211; <em>DE</em>)
... of the fight against the power of the revolutionary Kuomintang
for in this territory there is at present no power other than the
power of the revolutionary Kuomintang.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trotsky replied to this:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;These words fairly reek with the apparatus-like,
bureaucratic conception of revolutionary authority ... The government
is not regarded as the expression and consolidation of the developing
struggle of the classes, but as the same self-sufficient expression
of the will of the Kuomintang ... The provincial Kuomintang of Chiang
Kai Chek has an old, reactionary, mercenary bureaucracy at its
disposal. What has the Left Kuomintang? For the time being nothing,
or almost nothing. The slogan of soviets is a call for the creation
of real organs of the new state right through the transitional regime
of a dual government.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">But despite the slaughter of the militant workers in Shanghai the
Chinese Communist Party continued with this fatal policy of class
collaboration. Trotsky summed it up, saying that this policy was &#8220;to
bring one&#8217;s head voluntarily to the slaughter. The bloody lesson of
Shanghai passed without leaving a trace. The Communists, as before,
were being transformed into cattle herders for the bourgeois
executioners.&#8221; Other massacres followed at Changsha, Wuhan and
other cities, towns and villages but the official line continued for
another two years leading to the slaughter of the best workers and
peasant cadres in all the big cities.</p>
<p>At last in the early 1930&#8217;s there was a sudden and typical
Stalinist reversal after the damage had been done. But this is
another story. It included the setting up of abortive &#8216;Soviet
Republics&#8217; in relatively small areas of rural China between 1929
and 1934. These were eventually overrun by Chiang Kai Chek&#8217;s armies
backed by the Western powers. This defeat lead on to the famous Long
March and the setting up of a peasant army which eventually took
power in 1949, without any significant contribution by the urban
proletariat, leading to the establishment of a Stalinist dictatorship.</p>
