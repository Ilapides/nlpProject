<p class="fst"><strong>The Pensioners&#8217; rally at TUC annual meeting has now become a
regular event. This year over 1,000 people marched through Brighton
to demand a big increase in pensions.</strong></p>
<p>However that such a march had to take place is a sad commentary on
the failure of our Labour government after nearly three years in
office to carry out the resolutions calling for older working men and
women to receive an adequate income passed at TUC and Labour Party
conferences over the last ten years.</p>
<p>The maximum old age state pension with supplementary benefits
added (obtained only after a humiliating personal means test) comes
to little more than one-third of the average wages paid to employed
workers. This low income leads to the frequent hypothermia which
carries off hundreds of the old and infirm each winter. The pension
increases are always six to nine months too late and therefore never
compensate for the enormous price increases which have repeatedly
taken place in the case of gas and electricity etc.</p>
<p>Because of this, old people are constantly receiving fantastically
high bills, often followed by threats to cut off all heat if they
don&#8217;t pay up. The &#8220;kind&#8221; permission of the government to allow
us to run into debt does not alter the fact that these demands still
come and with some old and infirm people it has actually hastened their death.</p>
<p>These are the people whom the Labour government should have
relieved of all financial worries by this time by providing all OAPs
with a minimum income which everybody working, unemployed, old or
sick should be entitled to as of right. That should be at least
equivalent to a &#0163;50 a week gross wage. Why should a worker who
reaches retirement age take a sudden drop in living standards just
because he is older. He has earned the right to an adequate living in
his last years.</p>
<p>And to be blunt how can Jack Jones and the other TUC leaders, who
have campaigned so hard on the pensions question, effectively fight
for a decent income for the elderly when they accept the spurious
argument that the public expenditure cuts must be accepted to keep
Labour in office. <em>The truth is that the cuts will put Labour out
of office and 50% of average earnings for pensioners will be stopped
for another decade.</em></p>
<p>In my own borough, one of the richest in the country, after much
pressure by the local Labour party and other we were granted &#8220;bus
tokens&#8221; enabling a certain amount of local travel at reduced rates.
At first these tokens amounted to 100 every quarter at 2p each. Then
in the alleged interest of economy the Tory Council cut the number of
tokens to 60. In the meantime fares have been increased four times,
and if I wish to make a trip to the Labour Club to see a few friends
over half a pint of beer the trip costs 26p return. Four trips and
the total token allowance is gone!</p>
<p>On the face of it I can get a 50% reduction on train fares on
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday only. If I wish to visit old comrades
in Liverpool for instance this sounds reasonable until it is realised
I must pay &#0163;6 for the rail pass.</p>
<p>At one time a pensioner wishing to raise a query with the local
Social Security Office could phone from a call box and then give the
number and the clerk would then phone back when the pensioner&#8217;s
money had run out. Now this has been abolished &#8211; no reverse calls
are allowed. This means the pensioner must either put more money in
the phone box or got to the office over three miles on foot, or pay
out more exorbitant bus fares.</p>
<p>The fight for a decent pension cannot be separated from the fight
to reverse the public expenditure cuts, lower unemployment and raise
weal wages in general. That requires a new strategy by the TUC
leaders who spoke at the rally, based on the socialist aims of the
labour movement that many old age pensioners who were present at the
tally fought for in their years at work.</p>
