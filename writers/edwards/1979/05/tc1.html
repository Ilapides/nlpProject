<p class="fst"><i>Not only did trades councils precede the TUC [Trades Union
Congress], but it was these bodies which brought the TUC itself into
existence. As a matter of fact, they were an independent, grass-roots
working-class movement from the very first.</i></p>

<p>Today, many thousands of workers in Britain have served as
delegates to their local trades councils. This very numerous body of
working men and women often represents the most class-conscious,
active, and intelligent section of the working class in the locality
in which they work.</p>

<p>They spend many hours of their leisure time endeavouring to
co-ordinate all the working-class struggles for a better life in
their district. They discuss and take decisions on every conceivable
issue involving the interests of the workers.</p>

<p>The trades councils themselves can generally quite justly be
described as the advanced detachment of the organised working class.
Most of them are also inspired by the idea that they are working for
a greater cause than themselves. They believe there is a need for a
fundamental change in society.</p>

<p>At the same time, they struggle for a decent living wage, adequate
housing, a fair deal for old age pensioners, a better urban or rural
environment – they discuss and formulate countless other demands
and then campaign for them.</p>

<p>All this activity is done voluntarily, without thought of
remuneration or personal advantage. But of over 500 Trades Councils
no more than three or four have full-time secretaries. For this
reason the Trades Council movement is probably freer from the
bureaucratic mentality than any other area of the British trade union
movement.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, sometimes this self-sacrificing body of workers are
not sufficiently aware of the great significance of their own
dedicated work, or of the tremendous historical role of the Trades
Councils in the long struggle of the working class to create an
organisation powerful enough really to change society and put an end
to the system of monopoly capitalism under which we live.</p>

<p>History shows that the Trades Councils could well become the
organs through which working class power will finally be achieved. To
quote Frederick Engels: “The full emancipation of the working class
must be the act of the working class itself.” The Trades Councils –
which, significantly, were in the past combined with Labour Party
general management committees in some key industrial areas – could
be a vital means of carrying through this action to its logical
conclusion.</p>

<p>In the recent past, this revolutionary side of Trades Council
action has often not been very evident.</p>

<p>The decades of capitalist economic upturn which followed the
Second World War brought a period of relative lull in the class
struggle, and many Trades Councils become docile appendages of the
TUC, concerned with little more than “parish pump” politics.</p>

<p>Yet, whenever the working class began to move on a broad front
against the capitalist establishment, the Trades Councils sprang into
action. It is for this reason that the more right-wing section of the
trade union officialdom became concerned to reduce the Trades
Councils to purely consultative bodies, and many workers came to
think they had been created by the TUC to be nothing but the General
Council’s mouthpiece in the localities.</p>

<p>A look at history shows that this is a false notion. The TUC
actually grew out of the trades council movement. It was a number of
the key trades councils, already established as the leadership of the
movement locally, who took the initiative in bringing the trade
unions together in a national body.</p>

<p>Today, this aspect of trades councils is again becoming of vital
importance in the present growing struggle to repel the efforts of
the Tory government and big business to put the trade union movement
in a straight-jacket by means of various kinds of anti-union
legislation, wage freezes, and other reactionary moves.</p>

<p>It was Sam Nicholson, President of the Manchester and Salford
Trades Council speaking at its first meeting in 1868, who first
called “for a congress of our own”, and the first TUC was
actually called in that year.</p>

<p>The invitations were sent out only to “trades councils and
trades federations.” “Thirty four delegates attended this
congress of which eleven were from provincial trades unions. At the
1868 congress, the Birmingham Trades Council was deputed to convene
the next one.”</p>

<p>At this second congress in 1869, forty delegates attended, still
mostly from trades councils. For the first time delegates from the
London Trades Councils were present.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that at this time a committee was
appointed “to prepare a statement to go out to the world, to trade
unions and legislators as to the reasons why we hold the opinion
therein contained.”</p>

<p>Its agenda reminds us of our fight against the Industrial
Relations Act today (i.e. under the 1970–74 Health government –
<i>ed.</i>). Most of the discussion centred around how a fight could
be waged against a report of a Royal Commission on TU legislation
which left unionists liable to criminal prosecutions under an 1825
Act.</p>

<p>The first victories for a really radical policy calling for an
eight-hour day – a potentially revolutionary demand at that time –
and other socialist demands were won at the 1890 TUC. This break with
the old-style trade unionism was largely the work of trades councils.</p>

<p>But in 1895, the more conservative elements retaliated are were
able to get the trades councils excluded from direct affiliation –
ostensibly because this involved dual representation.</p>

<p>Today, the trades councils have only one fraternal representative
at TUC. The Trades Council Joint Consultative Committee has only six
representatives elected by trades councils, with six appointed by the
TUC. It has therefore become a “policy executing, rather than a
policy-making body.”</p>

<p>Despite this constitutional restriction of their powers, however
the trades councils have rapidly increased their authority during
periods of economic crisis and sharpened class struggle. During such
periods they have become the focusing point of all working-class
struggles, especially in the big industrial centres.</p>

<p>In particular, the sudden increase in the authority and
independent action of the trades councils during the 1926 general
strike alarmed the right-wing leaders of the TUC. This was the basic
reason why such leaders as James Thomas worked frantically to stop
the strike as soon as it had started.</p>

<p>One could do no better than quote the words of the famous Labour
and Social Democratic historian, G.D.H. Cole, to illustrate what the
Jimmy Thomases were afraid of. In his book <b>British Trade Unionism
Today</b>, Cole wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">“The hour of glory of the trades councils came in the
General Strike of 1926, when either directly or through councils of
action which they took the initiative of creating on a broad base,
they assumed the task of local organisation and responsibility for
the conduct of the strike.</p>

<p class="quote">“A great many of them during this period issued local
newspapers or bulletins to replace regular newspapers ... They issued
permits for goods to be delivered to hospitals and other necessary
services; they improvised special transport services and conducted
intensive propaganda campaigns in neighbouring villages.</p>

<p class="quote">“On the whole this work, improvised in a few days, was
done with remarkable skill and efficiency and showed large resources
of strength and competence in the local leadership.”</p>

<p class="fst">It was this which struck fear into the hearts of the employers,
and worried the right-wing TU leaders. It was a flowering of that
amazing initiative and ingenuity of which the British working class
is capable, when the dead hand of officialdom is removed.</p>

<p>During the nine days which shook capitalist Britain, the embryonic
forms of what Lenin called ‘dual power’ were rapidly forming.
Some trades councils even began to set up their own workers’
defence force – to establish their own law and order. In Newcastle,
almost complete control over all transport was established. In some
areas in the North East, under pressure, the police even agreed that
the special constables should be recruited from the strikers
themselves.</p>

<p>Contrary to the views expressed by the TUC president at the 1973
congress, the workers demonstrated in 1926 that the organised working
class could take responsibility for the efficient administration of
each area and, if necessary, of the country.</p>

<p>If the leaders of the General Council in 1926 did not understand
this then, the Tory Prime Minister Baldwin certainly did when he
mobilised all the forces of repression: tanks, armoured cars, and the
OMS – the auxiliary strike-breaking organisation, backed and
subsidised by the government. The ruling class saw the whole movement
as a challenge to their system.</p>

<p>Naturally, when the strike was betrayed, the trades councils were
again reduced to the passive and secondary role allotted to them by
the right wing bureaucracy. Nevertheless, the trades councils remain
potentially capable, in any new period of great events, of mobilising
the working-class struggle to change society.</p>
