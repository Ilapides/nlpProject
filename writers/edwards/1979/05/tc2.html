<p class="c"><b>The second part of an article by Dudley Edwards<br/>
Written during the office of 1970–74 Tory government</b></p>

<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />

<p class="fst"><i>The idea of broadening Trades Councils to include
representatives from shop stewards’ committees and councils is
gathering growing support among the rank and file of the trade unions
and from the leadership of some unions.</i></p>

<p>Such changes would immensely increase the co-ordinating power of
Trades Councils. They would then become the real parliaments of
Labour in each locality, drawing into their meetings representatives
from the factories, offices, transport depots and hosts of other
establishments.</p>

<p>This would infuse new life and strength into the entire labour
movement.</p>

<p>The areas where the trades councils have been playing a major part
in the local and national strikes and struggles are, significantly,
precisely those in which Labour has the most solid basis of electoral
support – Liverpool, Manchester, Tyneside. This fact destroys
forever the false argument of those right wingers who are forever
suggesting that militant industrial action on the wage front or
political strikes against anti-union legislation such as the
Industrial Relations Act harm the Labour Party in elections.</p>

<p>It is the determination to use both political and industrial means
against the Tories and big business who are attempting to solve the
capitalist crisis at the expense of the working class, which welds
the whole class together as a united force. It is this struggle which
increases support for the return of a Labour government – if Labour
fights on a genuine class policy.</p>

<p>No exact formulas can be laid down, but history suggests that such
initiatives to expand the scope of Trades Councils could prepare the
way for future genuine ‘councils of action’ uniting and
co-ordinating the struggles of all the working people in a local
area.</p>

<p>Trades Councils can become the lynch pins of that working class
unity which is the pre-condition for the overthrow of capitalism,
laying the corner-stone of the socialist society.</p>

<p>It was the National Conference of Trades Councils which first took
up a position of uncomplicated opposition to the big businessmen’s
club, the Common Market. At that National Conference (held at the
time of writing, under the Health government) the resolutions
included a straightforward socialist motion on the economy and
opposition to any further consultations with the Tory government:</p>

<p class="quoteb">“This Conference believes that no good will come to the
working people of Britain from the pursuance of tripartite
consultations between the government, the TUC and the CBI conference
and therefore calls on the TUC to waste no further effort in such
consultations, but instead redouble its efforts to establish a truly
socialist state and to work for the return of a Labour government
firmly pledged to the introduction of legislation designed to achieve
this end.”</p>

<p class="fst">It is true that such forthright resolutions are not binding on the
trade union movement, but the rank and file sentiment expressed here
is an indication of the direction which the whole trade union
movement is likely to take in the stormy years ahead.</p>

<p>There are few, if any, other countries where such a great mass
movement exists, entirely controlled by ordinary men and women from
their places of work.</p>

<p><i>Trades Councils can be built up into organisations capable of
not only changing society but of acting as a channel for the full and
democratic participation of the whole working class in the building
and control of the new democratic socialist society of the future.</i></p>
