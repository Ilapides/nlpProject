<p class="fst"><strong>Proletarian Philosophers</strong><br/>
by Jonathan Ree<br/>
<em>Oxford University Press 1984, &#0163;15.</em></p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;He will be a smart policeman who can arrest the spread
of ideas.&#8221; (Quotation from the old <strong>Plebs</strong> magazine which was
published by the National Council of Labour Colleges during the 1920s)</p>
<p class="fst">This book gives a valuable picture of those more thoughtful
working men and women, who during the first quarter of the century,
strove to grasp the principles of scientific socialism as it was
followed by Marx and Engels, elaborated by Lenin, Trotsky and others
and skilfully expounded in Britain by the Scottish Marxist John
Maclean, and the great Irish workers&#8217; leader James Connolly.</p>
<p>In drawing attention to these early worker students of Marx, the
author has done the labour movement a service.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this long essay at no point sets out in a clear way
the main principals of Marxism considered as a &#8216;guide to action&#8217;
which if properly used by the working-class can bring about the
transformation of society and the carrying forward of mankind to the
next necessary stage in the organisation of civilization. Where the
author commits himself to any expression of view about the science of
Marxism, he reveals those prejudices frequent among university
lecturers on philosophy who see Marxism as a threat to their own
trade of teaching various philosophic systems, from which their
students may pick the one most suited to their taste. (&#8220;If you pays
your money, you takes your choice.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Here is an example of how that prejudice comes out in print:&#8211;
&#8220;Who, might it be asked, could trust a social theory which is
affiliated to the recondite, sectarian and implausible dogmas of
Dialectical Materialism?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet nowhere does he attempt to set out what this theory is;
contenting himself with a priori condemnations of the above kind.
Neither he, nor any of his professional colleagues can explain why
this allegedly &#8220;implausible dogma&#8221; has been more successful in
predicting the course of historical events over the last 100 years
than any other social theory produced by university professors &#8211;
nor why the influence of Marxism has steadily increased in all parts
of the globe, even though government spokesmen and their university
allies have presented a false, but or dried, version of Marxism to
the masses of workers.</p>
<p>This book does give a useful historical outline of two sections of
proletarian would-be Marxists &#8211; those that supported the versions
of Marxist philosophy conceived by the older National Council of
Labour Colleges in the early &#8217;20s, and the ever-changing versions
developed by the Communist Party theoreticians, constantly forced to
adapt their theoretical zig-zags of the Stalinist dominated Communist
International of those years.</p>
<p>The early NCLC versions of Marxist philosophy suffered from the
lack of any serious knowledge of the writings of Lenin, the most
successful revolutionary leader of the 20th century, who adhered to
the materialist philosophy of Marx, exactly defined as dialectical
materialism. He found it a guide to successful action.</p>
<p>The school of Communist theoreticians lambasted this early school
of working men and women because they did not acknowledge the
completely incorrect additions to Marxist philosophy made by Stalin.
Nor would they adapt their theoretical notions to the opportunist
political tactics of Stalinism which sprang from Stalin&#8217;s theory of
&#8216;Socialism in one country&#8217; &#8211; the idea of building a socialist
society alone without the assistance of working-class governments in
other lands.</p>
<p>Because this controversy between two distorted versions of Marxism
ended in confusion we are told that the whole materialist philosophy
of Marxism &#8220;collapsed&#8221;, when in fact a new generation of
working-class Marxists are now coming into being, many of whom are
gathering around the <strong>Militant</strong>
paper. Young workers in particular are learning to apply Marxism as a
guide to action.</p>
<p>Since this review charges the author with nowhere attempting to
define what he means by dialectical materialism, although he abuses
it, it would be well to conclude with such a definition. Two
quotations are taken from Engels, who formulated this materialist
theory, and Trotsky, who brilliantly continued to express those ideas
in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Engels tell us &#8220;... Dialectics is nothing more than the science
of the general laws of motion of nature, human society and thought.&#8221;
(Engels &#8211; <strong>Anti-D&uuml;hring</strong>) This scientific method came to be
know as dialectical materialism because Marx and Engels saw that
universal matter preceded the appearance of Man and therefore man and
his ideas are the product of material change.</p>
<p>The brief definition given by Engels is rounded off by a more
detailed explanation from Trotsky written 60 years later.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The essence of Marxism consists in this; that it
approaches society concretely, as a subject for objective research,
and analyses human history as one would a colossal laboratory record.
Marxism appraises ideology as a subordinate integral element of the
class structure of society, as a historically conditioned form of the
development of the productive forces. Marxism deduces from the
productive forces of society the inter-relations between human
society and surrounding nature, and these in turn are determined at
each historical stage by man&#8217;s technology, his instruments and
weapons, his capacities and methods for struggle with nature.
Precisely this objective approach arms Marxism with the insuperable
power of historical foresight.&#8221; (Leon Trotsky &#8211; Address to
Mendeleyev Congress, Sept. 1925 in USSR)</p>
