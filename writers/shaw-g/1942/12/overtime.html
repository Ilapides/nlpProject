<p class="fst">Without any camouflage, the post-election attack against the forty-hour week is really a murderous assault against wages.</p>

<p>Workers are actually putting in many more hours than forty. In fact, they work too long and get too tired &#8211; as testified to by the 11,000 industrial casualties EVERYDAY.</p>

<p><strong>What bothers the bosses and the political boosters of boss profits is that the workers are being paid time and a half for work beyond the forty hours.</strong></p>

<p>All talk about a forty-eight-hour week is so much dust in the eyes &#8211; thrown by labor&#8217;s worst enemies. What they are aiming at is to take away from workers who daily risk their life and limb a few dollars &#8211; the few dollars the workers now make on time and a half.</p>

<p>How much are workers making anyway? With this bountiful overtime pay, are they rolling in wealth? A good question &#8211; to which there is a very factual answer!</p>

<p>Yes, there is a war boom. Yes, workers are being paid time and a ball over forty hours. BUT WITH ALL THAT &#8220;PROSPERITY,&#8221; 16,000,000 WORKERS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE EARNING LESS THAN $16 A WEEK!</p>

<p><strong>These figures are for July of 1942, issued by Secretary of Labor Perkins. And these figures mean that at the height of the war boom one-third of the working force of the country gets old-time, sweat-shop wages. That&#8217;s capitalism for you!</strong></p>

<p>All right. Let&#8217;s come up the scale. Let&#8217;s see how the better-off workers are making out</p>

<p>The average wages in all manufacturing industries reached $37.88 a week in September. Out of this small amount must be paid the following long list of items: <strong>food, clothing, rent, entertainment, education; household furnishings and furniture; doctors, dentists, hospitals; debts and insurance; income taxes, victory taxes, war bonds; rising prices and consumers&#8217; taxes.</strong> Has something perhaps been omitted? Well, just keep the change.</p>

<p>Secretary of Labor Perkins obligingly breaks this figure down a bit and reveals that the average wages in the manufacture of non-durable goods are only $29.71 &#8211; not $37.88. <strong>With a wife and kids and the above list of necessities, these workers cannot be exactly rolling in wealth.</strong></p>

<p>These days non-durable goods means mostly civilian production. So let&#8217;s see how the other workers, the favored war workers, are wallowing in the lap of luxury.</p>

<p>Elsa Maxwell &#8211; that lady columnist who knows from nothing except how to gush &#8211; recently wrote in the supposedly pro-labor <strong>New York Post</strong> the following fabulous lie about wages: <strong>&#8220;Experienced workers average from $100 to $200 a week.&#8221;</strong> Thus Elsa Maxwell, the party-throwing expert of high society.</p>

<p>However, Secretary Perkins has statistical responsibilities which demand some regard for the truth. She assures us that in the production of durable goods &#8211; which these days is mostly war production &#8211; the average weekly wage in September was $44.47.</p>

<p>Go back and look at the list of necessities that $44.47 has to cover! Of course, with $44.47 a worker can do a little better than with $29.71. He can do a lot better than with $16 &#8211; which is next to nothing at all. <strong>But he won&#8217;t have much money to hide under the mattress. If he can get by without resorting to the loan sharks, he&#8217;ll be a mighty good financial manager.</strong></p>

<p>The labor-haters in Congress are paid $200 a week out of public funds. Nearly all of them have some other sources of income &#8211; honest and otherwise. They get fees of one kind and another. They get returns on investments. <strong>Where do they get off to attack labor&#8217;s overtime pittance?</strong> And what of the big industrial boys who are the powers behind the congressional throne? There&#8217;s Tom Girdler of Republic Steel pocketing in salary alone $275,000 in 1941 &#8211; and Ferguson of Newport News Shipbuilding being paid $127,000 &#8211; and Love of Burlington Mills rewarded with a $179,652 salary &#8211; and Grace of Bethlehem &#8220;earning&#8221; a salary of $537,734 &#8211; to take a few at random.</p>

<p><strong>Where do these fattened leeches, sucking their profits from labor&#8217;s toil, get off attacking the workers&#8217; bit of overtime!</strong></p>

<p>Obviously the bosses and their politicians believe the worker and his family are beings of inferior flesh. They consider themselves the &#8220;Aryan&#8221; class in American society &#8211; with the workers created as their eternal slaves!</p>

<p>In the last week there has been an ominous lull in the war these foes of labor are waging against the forty-hour week and against the workers&#8217; overtime pay. Doubtless preparations are being made for the next encounter.</p>

<p><strong>Is organized labor also preparing for a counter-offensive? This is what it must do!</strong></p>
