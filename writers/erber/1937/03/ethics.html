<h2>Ernest Erber</h2>

<h1>Political Ethics?</h1>

<h4>(Statement)</h4>

<h3>(March 1937)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Appeal</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/socialistappeal/index.htm#sa03_03" target="new">Vol. 3 No. 3</a>, March 1937, p.&nbsp;39.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by by Damon Maxwell for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>Socialist Clarity</b>, organ of the Zam-Tyler (&#8220;Fight-Left-and-Right-Danger&#8221;) group, has reprinted under my by-line an outline I wrote on the labor party question two years ago when I favored the incorrect position of having Socialists help create a reformist party.</p>

<p>While one may grant that it is permissible to reprint a political article without the knowledge and consent of the author, it was distinctly unethical to reprint this particular article of mine without indicating the date of its writing and without adding some note to the effect that I no longer adhere to the views expressed therein, a fact of which I am sure the editors of <b>Socialist Clarity</b> are fully aware.</p>

<p>I am however gratified to know that the comrades of the Clarity group have arrived at my position of two years ago; this promises well for the future, especially for the younger members of the group, who benefiting by the increased tempo of political life today will pass much more quickly through the labor-party state of their development. As for myself, I now hold a position on this question in common with the other comrades in the Editorial staff of the <b>Socialist Appeal</b>.</p>
