<h4>*</h4>

<p class="fst">The political crisis which has gripped the Fourth International
since the outbreak of World War II is rooted in its false position on
the nature of the Russian state. However, as has been demonstrated so
many times in the history of political movements, a false position on
a key question disorients the entire program of a movement and
renders it incapable of answering other questions, even those that
appear to be unrelated to the key question. It was, therefore, not
long after the split in the movement over Russia&#8217;s role in the war
that the Fourth International committed its error on the national
question, the consequences of which all but equal those of the
Russian question.</p>

<p>The disastrous policy advocated by the Fourth International for
Poland and the rest of Eastern Europe under Russian rule is the
bitter fruit of <em>both</em> of these major errors, because the
political situation of these countries is dominated by national
oppression imposed by Russia. The result is that the political line
of the Fourth International, which <em>tends</em> everywhere to subvert
the revolutionary movement into a left opposition to Stalinism,
emerges in these Russian-occupied countries, as a result of the
direct effect of both major errors, in the role of <em>open</em>
defenders of the Stalinist police regime and of national oppression
against the popular democratic movement of national liberation.</p>

<p>The connection between the Russian question and the national
question is far more intimate than appears from superficial
examination. The link between these two questions is formed by the
fact that both are integrally related to an evaluation of the nature
of the epoch, one as a determinant of it and the other as an
extraction from it. Whether or not one recognizes that the national
question has reappeared in Europe as one of the main political
questions depends upon one&#8217;s analysis of the main trends of
development during the last twenty-five years of European history.
Without making the latter analysis the framework for one&#8217;s
investigation of the national question, it is impossible to establish
the relationship of national liberation struggles to the socialist
revolution. However, a historical analysis of this period of history
that proceeds, as must that of the Fourth International, from the
view that the Russian Revolution still lives and that Stalinism, no
matter how degenerate, represents its continuity, cannot possibly
come to the same conclusions about the nature of the epoch as a
historical analysis which proceeds, as ours does, from the view that
the Russian Revolution is dead and that Stalinism represents one of
the beginnings of barbarism.</p>

<p>Proceeding from the perspective that the social, economic and
political conditions of Europe, including the revolutionary
consciousness of the proletariat, had undergone no basic change since
the period of the early Comintem and that the prospects for the end
of World War II were for a repetition of the post-war revolutionary
waves of 1917&#8211;19, one could not possibly conclude that the national
question had returned after seven decades to dominate European
politics. The <em>strategy</em> of the proletarian revolution, as
formulated by the early Comintem and defended by the Left Opposition,
would then continue as the central political axis with the struggle
for proletarian state power as the main <em>political</em> slogan. The
occupation of the continent by Germany would, in this event, be but a
passing phase of the war which would be resolved by the rising tide
of proletarian revolution as was the less extensive German occupation
during the First World War. Under these conditions, the emergence of
national resistance movements with influence among the masses would
be correctly viewed as solely of <em>tactical</em> importance for the
revolutionary movement.</p>

<p>The Fourth International, of course, proceeded from the above
analysis. Its theoreticians could not understand that the events of
the last quarter century required that the <em>strategy</em> of world
revolution be altered <em>precisely</em> in order to achieve the aim of
world revolution. Being epigones, these theoreticians had learned the
strategy by rote and had come to assume that any changes in &#8220;<em>the</em>&#8221;
strategy must mean changes in the revolutionary goal. A strategy of
world revolution that took into account the events of history and
sought to find new points of support for the proletarian revolution
in the mass national and democratic movements appeared to them as an
attempt, not to make necessary revisions in strategy, but. to
substitute some other kind of &#8220;revolution&#8221; for the
proletarian revolution.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Taking Note of Some Changes</h4>

<p class="fst">Our struggle against this sterility based itself, in large
measure, upon an analysis in which our views on the nature of the
Russian state and on Stalinism played a major role. This analysis was
composed of the following decisive factors that had shaped world
history since the early 1920s:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>The first workers&#8217; state had been destroyed and replaced by
a totalitarian rule that based itself upon the state-owned economy;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>The organized mass revolutionary movement, product of
decades of struggle that crystallized in the Comintern, had been
destroyed and replaced by a ruthless and efficient agency of
counter-revolution in the form of Stalinism;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>The working class, deprived of a revolutionary leadership,
had fallen victim to fascism in Central Europe;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>The combined effects of reformism, Stalinism and fascism
had hurled back the proletariat in terms of political consciousness
and revolutionary organization;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>The continued decline of capitalist economy was bringing
about a decay and disintegration. in social institutions and in
culture that marked the undoing of several centuries of civilized progress;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>The emergence of the outlines of organized barbarism
(Germany, Russia) as the alternative to a socialist reorganization
of society;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>The outbreak of a Second World War with its threat to
complete the destruction begun by fascism.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">The correct reading of these changes revealed that Europe, in the
absence of the proletarian revolution, was rapidly slipping backward
and that long outlived political problems were once more reappearing
on its agenda. This is the essence of what we have referred to as
&#8220;retrogression,&#8221; a concept which has been so badly
misunderstood or misrepresented by our opponents. One of the products
of this retrogression is the undoing of a great part of the progress
achieved in an entire historical period (the bourgeois revolution) in
the solution of the national problem. State frontiers, having
outlived their usefulness, had become fetters on the economic and
political progress of Europe by the beginning of the Twentieth
Century. Europe could not progress without the abolition of state
frontiers through the unification of European economy as a whole. But
this unification would mark progress <em>only</em> if it were brought about by
the democratic process of the socialist revolution. The unification
of Europe through imperialist conquest and oppression could mark, not
a step forward, but only a step backward. Leaving aside the fact that
the imperialist unification would not necessarily raise the level of
production, it would constitute a retrograde process because its
political effect would not be, as some falsely believe, the transfer
of the proletarian struggle for power from a national to a
continental basis, but, rather, the transfer of the struggle in the
oppressed nations from <em>directly</em> proletarian socialist goals to
national liberation.</p>

<p>All modern history teaches us that national oppression has the
general effect of blurring class consciousness and heightening
national consciousness. The proletariat of the oppressed nation
quickly discovers that every struggle which it wages in behalf of its
class interests finds its <em>first</em> and <em>most formidable</em> obstacle in the
troops and police of the state power, i.e., the foreign oppressor.
The proletariat&#8217;s struggle for national liberation is, therefore, not
the result of some vague feeling without material basis, born of
bourgeois patriotic propaganda, as some sectarians believe. It arises
from the logic of the class struggle itself. The course pursued by
the proletariat in the struggle for national liberation &#8211; whether it
submerges its class interests in the struggle of the nation for
liberation or whether it wages its class struggle as a struggle on
behalf of the nation as a whole through <em>leading</em> the struggle for
national liberation &#8211; depends entirely upon the correct strategic
orientation of the proletariat, that is to say, of its organized,
political vanguard. The struggle for national liberation, therefore,
can become the lever by which the proletariat achieves the leadership
of its nation and by which the successful liberation of the nation
becomes merged with the socialist revolution as a consequence of the
proletariat taking state power in the process of liberation. It is
this aspect of the problem that gives the national question its
crucial importance wherever the national question emerges as the
dominant political problem. It is because of this that a movement
which is incapable of understanding the national question is totally
impotent as a revolutionary leadership wherever the national question
predominates. That is why the bankruptcy of the Fourth International
on the national question during the occupation of Europe by the Nazis
meant its bankruptcy as a revolutionary leadership, no matter how
loudly it called for &#8220;soviets&#8221; and the Socialist United
States of Europe. Or rather, one can say, the louder they called for
these as <em>substitutes</em> for the struggle of national liberation, upon
which they had turned their backs, the more bankrupt they declared
themselves in the real struggle for the proletarian revolution.</p>

<p>No graver error, nor a more revealing one, can be made than to
assume that the national question was a problem limited to wartime
Europe. Those who hold this view cannot possibly understand the
Marxist-Leninist concept of the national question, in general, nor
the essence of the national question in its reappearance under new
world conditions in particular. Every wartime military occupation of
foreign soil does not give rise to a national question, even if it
does give rise to <em>movements</em> of national resistance. Such movements
in the course of the First World War were correctly denounced by the
revolutionary Marxists as social patriotic movements that could only
<em>divert</em> the proletariat from its revolutionary goals. It is, as we
have said previously, a problem of the epoch.</p>

<p>The liberation of the continent from the Nazis did not do away
with the national question. It merely shifted national oppression
from Western Europe to Germany, leaving Eastern Europe unchanged in
this respect except for a change from German to Russian oppression.
The national question has reappeared in Europe to remain until the
socialist revolution. This assertion is true because the solution of
the national question on the plane of 1871&#8211;1939 would require a
degree of progress under capitalism which it is utterly incapable of
achieving, above all, when the real prospect for Europe under
capitalism is for <em>no progress whatsoever</em>.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The National Question Remains</h4>

<p class="fst">The unification of Europe through imperialist conquest, which we
referred to previously, was not a necessity that was peculiar to
German capitalism alone. It is part of the whole drive of modern
imperialism which has resulted on a world scale in the trend toward
fewer and ever greater powers just as within each capitalist nation
the trend is toward fewer and greater units of monopoly capital. The
division of the world into a Russian and an American sphere has not
yet exhausted this process. The two giants stand poised to grapple
for final world supremacy.</p>

<p>The corollary of this process is the reduction of the rest of the
nations of the world to one of varying degrees of subserviency to the
two great powers This does not mean that every n.ation has a national
question as a result of domination by Russia or the United States.
The great economic power of the latter permits it to dominate other
nations through a variety of forms that enable it to gain its ends
without direct military occupation. Russia likewise dominates some
countries (Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia) without direct occupation,
through the agency of the native Stalinist apparatus. Wherever the
foreign domination is exercised without a direct use of military
power by the oppressing nation, the national question tends to recede
in importance because the direct state power is exercised by the
native ruling class, however subservient it may be to the foreign
power. As a result, the national question remains as the dominant
political question in those nations of Central Europe (Germany,
Austria) and of Eastern Europe directly occupied by the forces of
Anglo-American or Russian imperialism.</p>

<p>We see, therefore, that the national question is not a matter of
wartime military occupation. It is, as would have also been the case
in the event of a German victory, a matter of national oppression for
an indefinite period. This means that we face a period in which the
revolutionary strategy of large sections of the European proletariat
will revolve around the national question. By the same token, we face
a period in which a revolutionary movement that persists in
misreading history and misunderstanding the national question can
have no prospect of success.</p>

<p>The ability of the Fourth International to free itself from the
sectarian impasse in which it has landed on the national question is
severely restricted by the role of its Russian position as an
obstacle to a clear comprehension of the extent to which Europe has
been &#8220;hurled back.&#8221; How can one comprehend the reality of
retrogression if one believes that half of Europe is dominated by the
armies of a workers&#8217; state, which introduce &#8220;reforms&#8221; which
&#8220;<em>facilitate</em> the realization of the socialist revolution&#8221;?
No matter how much such a position laments the fact that the
socialist revolution is brought closer through the agency of the
Russian bureaucracy itself instead of by the proletariat itself, such
a position must still contend that socialism is being brought closer.
This latter process does not constitute retrogression. It constitutes
progress. If Russia, <em>vis-&#224;-vis</em> capitalism, represents
progress and Russian might, assisted by the Stalinist mass movements?
pas grown, all talk of retrogression and the reappearance of the
national question becomes objectively counter-revolutionary. That is
why two basic currents that struggle for supremacy in the
international movement divide on <em>both</em> questions, the Russian question
<em>and</em> the national question.</p>

<p>An attempt to establish a position which believes that Russia
remains a &#8216;Workers&#8217; state but that retrogression has carried Europe
to the point where the national question dominates the politics of
half the continent is an attempt to make an illogical,
internal1y-contradictory construction. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> It would fall apart
immediately if tested in a real political situation, such as Poland
represents today. Likewise, an attempt to establish a position that
holds that Russia has retrogressed to capitalism (which means
fascism), but that Europe as a whole has not retrogressed to the
point where the national question reappears on its agenda, is to make
an eclectic construction which is absurd on the face of it. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> The
absurdity of this latter theoretical construction is that it
recognizes the complete retrogression of the Russian Revolution into
its extreme opposite, fascist barbarism, but fails to understand the
simple fact that the retrogression of the Russian Revolution, both in Russia and as a
world movement, is the starting point from which all other aspects of
retrogression get their impetus. This position also would find its
total debacle in Poland. To make the call for &#8220;soviets&#8221; and
the &#8220;Socialist United States of Europe&#8221; the central
political slogans in Poland today would expose this position as
totally sterile and without the possibility of finding a point of
political contact with either camp-the Warsaw Quisling regime or the
national liberation movement. A position that denies retrogression
and preaches the imminent proletarian revolution but finds itself
reduced to neutrality between two mass forces that periodically
threaten to erupt into civil war becomes a laughable incongruity.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Germain Does Violence to Facts</h4>

<p class="fst">In our previous article on Poland, dealing with the nature of
state power in that country, we pointed out how the false position on
the Russian question held by the Fourth International forces it to
maintain that Russia is interested in saving capitalism in Poland and
that it erects a police dictatorship for that purpose, but concludes
that the Polish workers must defend this regime against the bourgeois
democratic opposition. This unfortunate position leads its unhappy
exponent, Ernest Germain <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a>, to do further violence to fact and
reason whenever he touches upon the national question in Poland. The
result is a repetition of all the traditional errors on the national
question which have been the stock-in-trade of every sectarian
opponent of Leninism on this question, plus a few new ones tailored
to fit the exceptional situation in which the official policy of the
Fourth finds itself in Poland.</p>

<p>We say &#8220;touch upon&#8221; advisedly, because Germain is careful to skirt around the national
question in Poland in order to avoid the necessity of making an
analysis of Russia&#8217;s role in Poland. Germain&#8217;s article abounds with
indications of what he believes Russia&#8217;s role <em>not</em> to be. From our
foregoing analysis of the relationship between the Russian question
and the national question, it is easy to see why Germain should be so discreet.</p>

<p>Germain, for instance, finds it necessary to place quotation marks
around the words &#8220;exploit&#8221; and &#8220;oppress&#8221; when
referring to our view of Russia&#8217;s role in Poland. The purpose of
these quotation marks is to make sure that the reader under&#8221;
stands that these characterizations of Russia&#8217;s role are those of <strong>The
New International</strong> and not of Germain. A few lines later, Germain
makes reference to the views of our collaborator, A. Rudzienski, on
the nature of the revolution which Poland faces and, in quoting,
finds it necessary to include in his quotation a sentence which
expresses Rudzienski&#8217;s view that Russia subjects Poland to colonial
exploitation. Lest someone be given the impression that Germain
accepts this part of the quotation, he hastens to introduce his
comments by saying, &#8220;Let us disregard the question of whether or
not Poland is at present subject to &#8217;colonial exploitation&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the absence of a forthright statement on the question, we are
entitled to assume, at least, that Germain is not prepared to commit
himself as to whether Poland is oppressed and exploited by Russia,
either in a colonial or any other manner. The <em>facts</em> of Russia&#8217;s role
in Poland are not in dispute. Almost everyone, with the exception of
the Stalinists and their apologists among the liberals, accepts the
view that Russia subjects Poland to political dependence and forces
upon her such trade relations as are Ito the advantage of
Russia. This has been amply demonstrated in the studies of
Russia&#8217;s role in Poland by <a href="../../../rudzienski/index.html" target="new">Rudzienski</a>, which have appeared in these pages and in <strong>Labor Action</strong>. We very much doubt that Germain will rest
his argument on a refutation of our factual material. To do this, he
would have to paint the Kremlin in such altruistic colors that they
would be unacceptable to anyone in the Fourth International.</p>

<p>If Germain agrees with us that the Polish regime is politically
subservient to the will of Moscow and that the laUer seeks to use
Polish economy and resources for purposes of rebuilding Russian
economy, why should he refuse to tenn this relationship as oppression
and exploitation? The answer rests on the fact tlIat what is at stake
is an <em>interpretation</em> of more or less commonly accepted facts about
Russiaos role. Germain admits the facts of Russian political and
economic policy in Poland but is forced to support Russia against the
bourgeois democratic movement of national liberation on the basis of
his view that Russia is a workers&#8217; state and Poland a bourgeois
state. One may condemn and criticize the <em>methods</em> by which the Kremlin
carries out its policy in Poland (which Germain does) and keep within
the Russian position of the Fourth, but how can one denounce the
role of a workers&#8217; state, no matter how degenerate, and support its
bourgeois democratic, peasant opponents or its reformist (really,
Menshevik) proletarian opponents? If one proceeds from the view that
Russia and Poland rest upon antagonistic class foundations, the
former working class and the latter bourgeois, then support to a
national liberation movement in Poland would constitute aid to the
bourgeoisie against the workers&#8217; state, i.e., aid to the
counter-revolution.</p>

<p>The only political conclusion possible in Poland on the basis of
Germain&#8217;s reasoning is the conclusion he arrives at support the
imperialist oppressor and denounce his victims. This is the sum and
substance of Germain&#8217;s political line in the context of the actual
political relations in Poland today.</p>

<p>&#8221;Not true!&#8221; say the partisans of the official policy.
&#8221;We call for an independent Soviet Poland!&#8221; Yes, we are
aware of this slogan. More than that, we note that Germain labels
this the <em>central</em> slogan in Poland today. But this knowledge does not
affect by a hair&#8217;s breadth our characterization of Germain&#8217;s line as
being support to the Quislings and opposition to the fighters for liberation.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Poland Is Not China, You Say</h4>

<p class="fst">What does it mean to say that one is for an independent Soviet
Poland? Are we not also for an independent Soviet India? Or an
independent Soviet Indo-China? Or an independent Soviet Indonesia?
The aim of our struggle in these latter countries is certainly not
the replacement of British, French or Dutch imperialism by native
exploiters. Yet we never lose sight of who the <em>main enemy</em> is in
these oppressed nations. <em>Today</em> the main enemy is foreign imperblism.
Our central slogan is, therefore, &#8220;Drive out the imperialist
oppressor.&#8221; Our struggle against the bourgeois nationalists in
the nationally oppressed countries remains on the level of political
criticism, denunciation, clarification, etc., in an effort to wrest
the national liberation movement from their domination. But if we
permitted our struggle against the bourgeois wing of the national
liberation movement to become our <em>main</em> struggle <em>before</em> the
imperialist enemy has been driven out, we would be guilty of playing
a counter-revolutionary role. Trotsky&#8217;s criticism of the Comintern
line in the Chinese Revolution was not that it failed to make the
Kuomintang the main enemy in the period <em>before</em> the fall of Shanghai.
Trotsky&#8217;s criticism was directed at the policy of political and
military subordination of the Communists to the bourgeois nationalist
leaders and the failure to organize the masses independently of the
Kuomintang movement.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;But Poland is not China,&#8221; our opponents will protest.
&#8220;Poland is a European nation that has
gone through many national liberation struggles in its history and
cannot succeed any more today than in the past in achieving its
independence short of a socialist revolution.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">That Poland is not China, we are willing to grant. Yet the two
nations, today, have more in common than the fact that they both
excel in the quality of their pork products. One such common feature
is that neither enjoys national independence, <em>Poland less than China</em>.
A second common feature is that the main tasks of the revolutionary
partya re the same in both countries. These tasks can be described
in the following manner:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The task of the revolutionary party is ... to formulate its
program and its slogans in such a way as to rally <em>around
itself</em> all the exploited masses in the struggle against all
their exploiters. It bases itself on the dynamics of the class
struggIe and not upon the depth of chauvinist feelings, because
it knows that in the last analysis the struggle of the masses for
their national democratic aspirations can be victorious only by
colliding with bourgeois nationalism, can be victorious only through
the realization of the socialist revolution, which will require the
expulsion of the &#8220;occupier&#8221; as well as the destruction of
the &#8220;native&#8221; reactionary classes.</p>

<p class="fst">This description of the tasks of a revolutionary party which <em>I</em>
hold, apply in <em>both</em> Poland and China is a quotation from the article
by Germain. No Marxist who stands upon the theory of the permanent
revolution could reject its formulation wilhout becoming a petty
bourgeois nationalist. Germain, who wrote these words, is under the
impression, however, that they constitute a refutation of the
possibility of supporting the national liberation struggle in Poland!
If he believes that adhering to the above tasks means that the
Marxists cannot support the national liberation struggle, he must
believe that in those countries where Marxists <em>do</em> support the
national liberation struggle there is no need to adhere to these
tasks! Here we see revealed the fact that Germain knows nothing of
the Marxist concept of the national question and the Marxist strategy
in the struggle for national liberation. What he clearly implies is
that in a country like China the task of the revolutionary party is
something other than he describes above. What other policy does he
have in mind? Namely, one in which the revolutionary party does not
carry on the struggle for national liberation on the basis of its
<em>own</em> slogans, its <em>own</em> class organizations, etc., but
<em>subordinates</em> itself to the bourgeois nationalist movement. This
does not follow? This is an unfounded accusation and, therefore, a
slander? We shall demonstrate otherwise.</p>

<p class="quoteb">The &#8220;liberty&#8221; which Shachtman demands for &#8220;Poland&#8221;
has its very different meaning for the different social classes. The
&#8221;free Poland&#8221; of General Anders and Cardinal Hlond,
that is the Poland where the gentry and colonels are free to exploit
the peasants, assassinate strikers, and organize pogroms. The
&#8221;freedom&#8221; which the workers and landless peasants
require, is the freedom to drive out the land-owning clergy, the
capitalists, and the &#8220;managers&#8221; forced on them by the
State; it is the freedom to manage industry and the land themselves.
Petty-bourgeois politicians think that they can for the
moment disregard this difference in content, remaining 
satisfied with the similarity in formulation of the slogan. But to
drag the bourgeoisie and the proletarians, landless peasants and
exploiting peasants behind one and the same banner, means, in
the Twentieth Century, to fill an empty form with <em>bourgeois</em> content!</p>

<p class="fst">The above sentences of Germain precede immediately the previous
quotation on the tasks of the revolutionary party. These latter tasks
we have described as being an adequate description of the role of the
revolutionary party <em>in the national liberation struggle</em>. But to
Germain these tasks are <em>counterposed</em> to support for the liberation
struggle. But what role would the revolutionary party play if it <em>did</em>
support the national liberation movement according to Germain? The
role of joining with General Anders and Cardinal Hlond and dragging
all the conflicting classes behind the same banner, a bourgeois
banner, and of refraining from fighting for the kind of &#8220;freedom&#8221;
(i.e., freedom from exploitation) which the worker and peasant masses desire.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What Is a Bolshevik Policy?</h4>

<p class="fst">We ask, is this the role of the Fourth International in those
countries, like India, where it supports the national liberation
struggle? Was this the role of the Fourth International when it
supported China in the war against Japan, even after China became
openly a tool of American imperialism after Pearl Harbor? According
to Germain, supporting the national liberation struggle in India and
China requires the revolutionary party to drag the masses along
behind Chiang Kai-shek and Gandhi and to deny the right of the masses
to struggle for their own class interests.</p>

<p>If Germain still wishes to contend that this policy is falsely
imputed to him, let him describe the tasks of the revolutionary party
in India and China and show wherein they differ from the tasks which
he outlines for Poland as being the alternative to supporting the
liberation struggle. But let him not say that <em>he</em> implies no support
to the Chinese and Indian General Anders and Cardinal Hlonds, but
that in Poland &#8220;Shachtman&#8221; (i.e., the Workers Party) does
imply such support. For this requires citing chapter and verse from
our voluminous writings on the Polish question. He will not succeed,
either in reading such support <em>out</em> of our writings or <em>into</em> them.</p>

<p>It is not enough, therefore, to say that one is opposed to Russian
domination of Poland by virtue of raising the slogan of an
&#8221;independent Soviet Poland.&#8221; This slogan states our final
aim in <em>every</em> country. The problem of Marxist <em>politics</em> is not to state
the final aim (this is already stated by our program, if not by the
entire content of revolutionary Marxism), but to state at every
period what stage the struggle is in and <em>what to do next</em>. The
Mensheviks and Bolsheviks had complete agreement on the final aim of
the Russian Revolution. They adopted a common program in 1903,
largely written by Plekhanov. This sufficed for both factions until
1918, a year after the revolution! But each separate stage of the
revolutionary process found Mensheviks and Bolsheviks giving
different and opposing political answers to the problems of the day.
We can readily accept the slogan of an &#8220;independent Soviet
Poland&#8221; <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> put forward by Germain. Yet we would find ourselves
looking across barricades at Germain in Poland today were the
national liberation movement to erupt into civil war against the
Russian oppressor and its Warsaw Quisling regime. To call for an
&#8221;independent Soviet Poland&#8221; as the final goal and then to
proclaim the need to support the Russian puppet regime today, reveals
that this <em>central</em> slogan, whatever its propaganda value may be, gives
no automatic political line in the actual struggle of contending
forces today. The political line of Germain is adduced from other considerations.</p>

<p>Germain, who, presumably, unlike us, prefers an &#8220;independent
Soviet Poland&#8221; to one ruled by Gen. Anders and Cardinal Hlond,
cannot resist falling into the same sectarian channel which has been
worn deep but never wide, by successive generations of anti-Leninists
on the national question. Says Germain, in the section we have
quoted, &#8220;... in the last analysis the struggle of the masses
for their national democratic aspirations can be victorious only
through the realization of the socialist revolution.&#8221; This gem
of a thought has been the &#8220;crushing&#8221; argument of every
sectarian on the national question since Rosa Luxemburg <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> first
formulated it. Why should a mind allegedly sharpened with a study of
the Marxist method find it so difficult to distinguish between the
struggle for national liberation and the solution of the national
question? Why should it seem a contradiction people like Germain to
declare the national liberation struggle progressive and
simultaneously state that the national problem cannot be resolved
under capitalism?</p>

<p>Lenin&#8217;s polemics on the national question has already filled a
heavy volume. But were one to subtract his expositions on the
compatibility of the national struggle with the struggle for the
socialist solution of all social problems, the heavy volume would be
a mighty thin brochure indeed. For the concept of the relationship
between these two struggles composes practically the whole of Lenin
on the national question. Yet here we hear, in the middle of the
twentieth century and from the theoretical representative of the
Fourth International, the old bromide about the fallacy of the
national liberation struggle because socialism is the only solution.
The source of the errors of Luxemburg, Gorter, Bukharin, Ryatokov,
etc., on the national question in the period before the Russian
Revolution can be readily understood. They could at least argue (1)
that the proletarian revolution was an imminent probability and with
it the solution of the national questions and (2) that the national
liberation movements in countries like Poland succeeded in achieving
mass support only through advanced programs of economic and social
radicalism, like that of the Polish Socialist Society. Germain,
however, is forced to admit that the two main camps in Poland
represent the regime of oppression and the movement for national
liberation respectively, neither of them on the verge of erupting as
proletarian revolutionary movements. As a consequence, Germain is
reduced to resting his case solely upon the well-worn misconception
that since socialism is the only solution to the national question
today, all struggles for solutions under capitalism are utopian and reactionary.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The &#8220;Independent Soviet Poland&#8221;</h4>

<p class="fst">&#8220;But Germain does more than call for an independent Soviet
Poland,&#8221; his partisans will protest, &#8220;Germain also demands
the immediate departure of the Soviet occupation troops.&#8221; Good!
We heartily approve of this demand. Even more important, the vast
majority of the Polish people approve of this demand. But what if the
Russian troops refuse to heed our demand? If the Fourth International
intends that its demand for the &#8220;departure&#8221; (what a
delicate and considerate term!) be more than platonic advice, it must
implement it with a program of <em>action</em>. The following is suggested by
Germain. He states that the Fourth International will link the slogan
for &#8220;departure&#8221; with that of &#8220;fraternization between
the Polish workers and the Russian soldiers.&#8221; Again we say,
good! Again, we heartily endorse it. But we endorse it because we
comprehend the full revolutionary significance of fraternization and
do not accept it as a substitute for revolutionary struggle against
the imperialist oppressor. Fraternization is a weapon of the
revolution with which to disorganize and disrupt the organization and
discipline of the armed forces of the class enemy, with which to
weaken him militarily in preparation for the final struggle.
Fraternization was encouraged by the Bolsheviks on the fronts of the
First World War as a means of breaking up the imperialist armies. The
tactic of a national liberation movement in Western Europe during the
Nazi occupation would have been that of fraternization with the
German troops if the movement would have had a proletarian
revolutionary approach to the struggle. The fraternization with the
German troops would have had as its purpose the disruption of the
German army as a means of facilitating the process of <em>driving out</em> the
German occupant, not the hope of fraternally convincing them to
depart. If, however, Germain sees the tactic of fraternization with
the Russian troops in Poland in this light, much else that he sets
forth must go by the board.</p>

<p>If Germain agrees that the Polish masses are to mobilize around
the slogan of &#8220;drive out the Russian oppressors,&#8221; he must
proceed from the view that the Russians constitute <em>the main enemy</em>. In
this case, however, he will be in essential agreement with us on the
national question and the nature of the national liberation struggle.
For the slogan of &#8220;drive out the Russians&#8221; is not merely a
proletarian revolutionary slogan. It will set in motion wide masses
of people from various classes on a national basis. But it is
precisely because Germain understands the consequences of the slogan
of &#8220;drive out the Russians&#8221; that he balks at its acceptance
and takes refuge in the weasel-worded formula of calling for the
&#8221;departure&#8221; of the Russians and seeks to give to
fraternization a non-revolutionary, a &#8220;friendly&#8221; content.
The call for the &#8220;departure&#8221; of the Russian troops within
the context of the position of the Fourth is a cowardly concession to
the overwhelming national sentiment in Poland. It is a crumb thrown
in the direction of reality, a crumb that will be immediately taken
back by the Fourth International if the Polish masses undertake any
measures to hasten the &#8220;departure&#8221; of the Russian troops.</p>

<p>Germain seeks to give the demand for the departure of the Russian
troops a reason other than the national sentiments of the Poles. He states:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It [the Fourth International] demands the departure of the
occupation troops <em>precisely because</em> their presence is a brake upon
the struggle for the realization of the socialist revolution in
Poland, is even a brake upon the struggle for the defense of the nationalizations.</p>

<p class="fst">How explain the fact that the presence of the Russian troops is a
brake upon the realization of the socialist revolution? Is it not
precisely because the Polish masses are taken up with a national
problem as the number one political problem? Is not this fact which
Germain adduces only further verification of the validity of our
position on the national question?</p>

<p>The reference of Germain to the Russian troops constituting a
brake &#8220;upon the struggle for the defense of the
nationalizations&#8221; just makes no sense at all. If the aim of the
Russians is toward the &#8220;structural absorption&#8221; of Poland,
why should the presence of the Russian troops undermine the defense
of the nationalized economy which they seek to absorb into Russian
economy? It may make sense if Germain were willing to explain this
statement in terms of the increasing hatred of the Polish masses for
the Russians being also directed against the nationalized economy and
the consequent increase of the possibility that an overturn of the
Russian power would see the anti~Russian feelings vented against the
nationalizations introduced by the Russians. We are quite sure that
Germain does not have this possibility in mind.</p>

<p>What Germain really does is to (1) call the Warsaw regime a
bourgeois state, (2) call Russia a workers&#8217; state and (3) call upon
the workers&#8217; army to liberate the soil of the bourgeois state. This
is some going for a man who insists that the class criterion is basic.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What Is the Social Character?</h4>

<p class="fst">Germain asks us, with his usual sneer, what our attitude was
toward the resistance movements in Europe during the German
occupation. He writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Shachtman obstinately refused to answer the question: &#8220;What
is the social character of the various organizations toward which it
is necessary to take a position? Is it necessary, on the basis of a
distinction between mass organizations led by petty-bourgeois leaders
and bourgeois organizations directed by White Guards, to have a
different tactic toward these different organizations?&#8221; He waxed
indignant, however, when he was shown that under these conditions his
slogan of &#8220;Unconditional support of the resistance movement&#8221;
(in general? of all organizations?) implied by its lack of precision,
a support of <em>bourgeois</em> organizations.</p>

<p class="fst">The impertinence which Germain displays here is matched only by
his polemical dishonesty. (We will retract the characterization of
Germain as being dishonest in polemic, only if Germain insists that
he never read our resolution on the national resistance movements
which appeared in these columns in the issues of January and February
of 1943. In this case, however, Germain would be guilty of wanton
irresponsibility for engaging in a polemic based on hearsay evidence
of his opponent&#8217;s views.)</p>

<p>The confines of this article do not permit us to quote our resol
uti on of 1943 on the national question and the resistance movements.</p>

<p>But to date no opponent who has read our material has made the
accusation which Germain does. They have not made it because the
resolution deals at length with the heterogeneous character of the
resistance movements and the necessity to separate out the
proletarian elements and organize them in their own class
organizations. In the actual military operations against the Germans,
there is no alternative but to shoot in the same direction as do
reactionary bourgeois nationalists, while subordinating all other
struggles to the main struggle against the Nazis as a step toward
dominating the resistance movement and imbuing it with a
revolutionary proletarian perspective.</p>

<p>To recognize that the national question has reappeared in Europe
today does not mean that Europe is literally back in the period of
1793&#8211;1870. Only especially ignorant or especially malicious people
could read this out of or into our writings. The national question
reappears in an entirely different world situation and must be dealt
with along entirely different strategical lines. We can illustrate
this with the example of the views of Lenin and the Mensheviks on the
character of the Russian Revolution. Both proceeded from the view
that the Russian Revolution was a bourgeois revolution. For the
Mensheviks this meant that Russia would literally live through
another 1793. The roles of classes and parties were to be assigned
accordingly. Since the bourgeoisie led the 1793 revolution in France,
it would have to be the same in Russia. History, according to the
Mcnsheviks, demanded that Milyukov play the role of Robespierre.
Lenin, on the contrary, saw the bourgeois revolution against the
background of his time and the actual character of the Russian
bourgeoisie. He sought that strategical orientation that
realistically took into account the character of the revolution but
just as realistically proceeded from the conditions that prevailed in
the world of the twentieth century and their effect upon Russia.</p>

<p>Likewise, to recognize realistically the dominant position which
the national question has again assumed in much of Europe does not
mean to apply the strategy that was valid in Italy and Germany in the
period of 1848&#8211;71 when Marx and Engels wrote about it. Why do
opponents of the type of Germain then find it necessary to attribute
to us the view that recognition of the nationa1 question and support
to national liberation movements means a search for a Garibaldi among
the Polish colonels? We proceed from the view that (1) socialism is
on the order of the day, not a nascent bourgeois democracy, (2) only
the proletariat can lead progressive struggles to their final goal
and (3) a proletariat at the head of the national liberation movement
means a proletariat in power if the liberation is achieved, i.e., the
solution of the national question merges with the socialist solution
of the social, political and economic problem as a whole.</p>

<p>We repeat. Germain can only accuse us of fighting to restore the
Poland of 1939 because for him national liberation consists of
placing the native bourgeoisie in power. Because he does not see a
need for the latter in Poland today (confining it &#8211; wrongly &#8211; to
&#8221;backward&#8221; countries like India), he opposes the struggle
for national liberation. Is it for this that Trotsky labored to
clarify his concept of the permanent revolution against Stalinist
misrepresentation? One can truly state that we, thc open opponents of
Trotsky on the Russian question, remain the only people who can
consistently defend his great revolutionary contributions and
preserve them for the new generation of revolutionists. Our defense
of his views must be directed in the first place against those who so
zealously yearn for his mantle.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#f1" name="n1">1.</a> Trotsky&#8217;s views on the eve of the war were of this general
character. Trotsky not only recognized the retrogressive process and
the key role of Stalinism within it, hut made this recognition an
important consideration in his calculations. As a result, he was
acutely aware of the growing contradiction between his views on the
working class nature of the Russian state and the implications of his
analysis of retrogression. He resolved this dilemma by postponing any
further theoretical conclusions until the second world war would be
concluded and its political repercussions were known. His brilliant
article. <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1939/09/ussr-war.htm" target="new"><em>U.S.S.R. and the War</em></a>, written a few weeks after the war began, was his final rounded presentation on the subject of
retrogression and the nature of the Russian state. In this article he
poses the entire question from the point of view that either the
war will &#8217;conclude with a revolution, in which case both the problem
of the class character of the Stalinist state and the problem
of retrogression will he automatically resolved, or the proletariat
will fail to take power and require a complete re-analysis of
Marxist fundamentals, including the possibility of a world of
bureaucratic slave states. The actual results of World War 
II are somewhere between the two alternatives which Trotsky
posed. The failure of the proletariat to make a revolution in
post-war Rurope does not demonstrate its historic incapacity to
play the role which Marx assigned to it. Yet the continued and
accelerated retrogressive process places a question mark over
the abilitv of the proletariat to reassemble a revolutionary
leadership and take power before it is overtaken and destroyed by the
disintegrative tendency of capitalist civilization, of which the
threatening atomic war is the most potent force.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f2" name="n2">2.</a> This absurd position is actually held by the tendency led by
J.R. Johnson. In the course of the debates on the national question,
he added a further absurdity to it. This consisted of denying
the retrogressive development of Europe but of &#8220;recognizing-&#8221;
the reappearance of the national question! According to Johnson
Europe did not retrogress but moved forward &#8211; from the
proletarian revolutions of 1917&#8211;23 to the national liberation
movements of 1941&#8211;45! That is to say, from millions rallying to the
banner of Lenin to millions rallying to the banner of de Gaulle! This
utterly contradictory position could be encommpassed by the same
mind only because it was devoid of any understanding of what the
national question means in the Marxist-Leninist concept. For Johnson,
the beginning and end of the problem was to advise the French
proletariat that in process of making the proletarian revolution
they should also &#8220;throw out&#8221; the Germans, except, as
Johnson carefully added, those German soldiers who wanted to marry
French women and settle down to live in a Socialist France!</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f4" name="n4">4.</a> The use of the word &#8220;Soviet&#8221; in a popular description
