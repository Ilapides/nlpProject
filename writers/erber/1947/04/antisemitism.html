<p class="info">From <strong>The New International</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/issue3.htm#ni47_04" target="new">Vol. XIII No. 4</a>, April 1947, pp.&nbsp;127&#8211;128.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">The editors of <strong>The New International</strong> seek to edit it in the
spirit of free scientific inquiry within the general framework of
Marxist thought. As a result, there is no effort to counterpose &#8220;an
official&#8221; view in reply to every aspect of a subject dealt with in
a signed article. This is above all true where the subject matter is
not directly related to current political questions as in the fields
of history, philosophy, anthropology, literature, psychoanalysis,
economic theory, etc. Where the general line of an article is in
direct conflict with the view represented by the magazine, it is
published under the heading of &#8220;discussion article.&#8221; The general
line of the articles by A. Rudzienski on the problems of the Polish
labor movement is in accord with the views we have expressed
<a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/vol12/no07/notm2.htm" target="new">editorially</a> (September 1946), as well as with the views expressed regularly in <strong>Labor Action</strong>. The specific criticisms made in the
above letter by Edward Findley will, no doubt, be dealt with directly
by the author of the articles in question. However, in view of the
seriousness of the charges, we will express our views on several of
the questions which deal with matters of known fact or of general
political concepts.</p>

<p>The real facts of the Kielce pogrom are not yet established in
detail. This can only be done by an international commission of
investigation representing various tendencies of the labor movement
and having authority to conduct an inquiry on the spot, including
access to all pertinent documents relating to the incident. What is
known about Kielce is what Findley himself records in his letter. The
central fact which refers to the question of the Stalinists&#8217; guilt
is contained in Findley&#8217;s parenthetical insertion, &#8220;... tortured
to death several dozen Jews (who had been disarmed and turned over to
the mob by the Stalinist militia).&#8221; The responsibility of providing
protection to persecuted citizens rests in the first place upon the
authorities. If the Stalinist militia, the main armed force for the
preservation of &#8220;law and order,&#8221; turned the Jews over to the mob,
the guilt of the Stalinist regime should be considered established
beyond a doubt. Their participation in the pogrom must be considered
to have been explicit. To the extent that the political opposition,
mainly the Peasant Party, was in a position to intervene against the
pogromists and did not, they too bear the guilt for the barbarous
spectacle. However, it is exceedingly difficult to establish the
facts about the role of the Peasant Party. Here above all we have no
facts, only surmises, like Findley&#8217;s about the influence of the
Mikalyczyk movement in the area. The guilt of the Stalinist militia,
however, is established.</p>

<p>The fact that the workers struck in protest against the execution
of the &#8220;nine lynch mob leaders&#8221; cannot be accepted as evidence of
anti-Semitism. It must first be established that the persons executed
were the guilty ones. We would be most foolish to accept the word of
the Warsaw regime for this. If the local Stalinist militia was guilty
of turning the victims over to the mob, why should we believe that
their Warsaw chiefs dealt even-handed justice in seeking out the
pogromists? Is there not extreme plausibility on the side of
Rudzienski&#8217;s charge that the Stalinist agent provocateurs stir up
the pogroms and that the Stalinist police utilize them as an occasion
to frame up and liquidate political oppositionists? Is it not
possible that the strikes were on behalf of victims of Beirut&#8217;s GPU
and not in defense of pogromists?</p>

<p>We know from all experiences with pogroms and lynchings throughout
history that the actual participation in the mob actions usually
embraces an infinitesimal percentage of the population. That the
actual participants also usually have the sympathy of wider circles
goes without saying. But even these wider circles need not represent
more than a minority of the population.</p>

<p>Rudzienski has never denied the prevalence of anti-Semitism in
Poland. On the contrary, his articles have sought to trace this
characteristic of Polish life to its historic sources. What he did
contend was that the anti-Semitism of the Polish people as a whole,
and of the Polish working class especially, was greatly exaggerated
in the minds of people in Western Europe and America. The role which
Polish anti-Semitism has played in active political life is related,
as in other countries, to the amount of encouragement or tolerance it
receives from the authorities. In this sense, Rudzienski&#8217;s view
that the revival of active anti-Semitism is the result of artificial
stimulation through Stalinist channels does not deny the prior
existence of anti-Semitism among the people, especially the petty
bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>Nor does existence of Jews in prominent posts of the Stalinist
regime preclude an anti-Semitic role on the part of the latter. We
need but read the record of the Nazi occupation in Poland to realize
that among the Jews, as among all peoples, were found those elements
who faithfully served as Gestapo agents even though they knew that
they were assisting in the extermination of their own people. The
Jewish police of the Ghetto continued to carry out the task of
rounding up the deportees for the death camps even when their own
families were no longer immune, according to Marek Edelman in <strong>The
Ghetto Fights</strong>. Why should we expect protests from Jews in the
Warsaw regime who are either old-time Stalinist hacks, devoid of any
moral concepts other than those of the Kremlin machine, or
broken-down and exhausted ex-reformists who want nothing but the
peace and security they hope for in a government post? Trotsky has
had occasion to refer to the fact that Stalin was not above utilizing
undercover anti-Semitism in his fight against the Opposition,
especially where the continual reference to the Jewish names of
prominent Oppositionists and their alleged anti-peasant program would
line up support for Stalin in the countryside. The following
quotation is of interest in this regard:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;On February 27th in Jerusalem the Jewish daily,
<strong>Hadashot Haerew</strong>, denounced the growth of anti-Semitism in the
USSR. The Soviet authorities appear to &#8216;object&#8217; to this
anti-Semitism, but in reality the Jews see themselves passed over in
a thousand ways. For instance, entry to the schools which train
Soviet diplomats is practically barred to Jews, as only persons
originating from the National Republics are admitted. In practice,
people have to be of Russian origin to be considered as originating
from a National Republic. In the domain of literature and the cinema,
frequently subjects are chosen which are likely to evoke the old
anti-Semitic prejudices. For instance, it has become a popular theme
to extol Bohdan Chmielnicki on the screen and in books. It is well
known that Bohdan Chmielnicki, who lived in the 16th century in the
Ukraine, ardently persecuted the Jews.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;That anti-Semitism survived in Russians who have known
the old regime is a phenomenon by itself; but the fact that it also
exists among the younger generation is even more astonishing. It is
true that the awakening of a certain anti-Semitism seems called forth
by recent press and film propaganda.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;&#8216;Naturally this novel form of anti-Semitism provokes
reactions among the Jews of the USSR. That is why, for instance, no
more mixed marriages are being contracted.&#8217;&#8221; (<strong>East Europe</strong>,
March 12, 1947, London.)</p>

<p class="fst">Without knowing the political tendency of <strong>Hadashot Haerew</strong> nor
the accuracy of their reference to mixed marriages, we know from the
whole trend of Russian nationalism and Great Russian chauvinism that
Stalinism is not at all immune to the practices referred to. Who
would deny that in a period of crisis the Kremlin would not resort to
pogrom as a means of diverting mass discontent that would threaten
the regime, even as the Czars did? The last thing that would stand in
the way of those who have the blood of millions of innocent people on
their hands would be moral scruples. Then why is it not likely that
the Stalinist machine in Poland, where it confronts a mass
opposition, engineers events like the Kielce pogroms for its own
political purposes? To determine the role of NSZ bands from the
forests or to analyze the extent of anti-Semitism among people is
important. But it must not obscure the fact that the prime guilt is
upon the heads of the Warsaw regime.</p>

<p>Findley&#8217;s challenge to Rudzienski &#8220;to cite specific acts of
material aid to the Warsaw ghetto fighters&#8221; on the part of the
Polish underground reveals an astounding lack of information about
the Ghetto uprising on the part of one whose contributions in the
pages of our press have been so rich in factual material on Jewish
political problems. All accounts of the Ghetto battle establish that
the Ghetto fighters were armed entirely from the outside. Their chief
supplies of arms, as well as military instructors and advisers, came
from the underground Polish Socialist Party.</p>

<p>Mary Berg&#8217;s <strong>Warsaw Ghetto</strong>, written as a diary of her
experiences as an inhabitant of the Ghetto and an internee in a
Ghetto prison, speaks bitterly about the failure of the Polish
population to give more aid to the Jewish victims of their common
oppressor. Her bitterness seems restrained when one considers the
circumstances under which she wrote it. Yet one must weigh the
failure of more Poles to conceal Jews in their homes at the risk of
their own lives (and the hiding of someone in a city apartment for
years is not easy) against the operation of this same instinct of
self-preservation among the Jews themselves, above all the hostility
of the Jewish community during its first two years against those in
its midst who carried on a counter-terror against the Gestapo. Their
hostility was born of a fear of Gestapo reprisals against the
community as a whole. But even Mary Berg&#8217;s account, that of a
young, unpolitical observer, repeatedly exonerates the Polish working
class movement from her accusations against the Polish population at large.</p>
