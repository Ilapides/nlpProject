<p class="fst">The Polish question is today the acid test for the two opposing
concepts that have struggled for supremacy in the Fourth
Internationalist movement since the American party split over the
issue of defensism in Russia in 1940.</p>

<p>The importance of the Polish question does not stem from the
possibility of the Fourth International effecting the situation one
way or the other in that unhappy country in the foreseeable future.
Unfortunately, few Polish Trotskyists have survived the ravages of
the Gestapo and the GPU. The task of rebuilding the revolutionary
movement in Poland is, of course, related to the theoretical and
political dispute represented by the Polish question. But the
immediate and over-all importance of the Polish question exists in
the fact that the political line taken on Poland will indicate
whether the Fourth International will pass yet deeper into the shadow
of Stalinism or whether it will resolve its political crisis by
cutting itself free from the Russian axis, around which its politics
have revolved, and emerge as a revolutionary, proletarian force,
truly independent of the two great imperialist power combinations
that dominate world politics.</p>

<p>The reason why Poland provides such an exceptional test is that
the Polish situation combines the two main theoretical questions that
divide the international Marxist movement today. These are (a) the
<em>Russian question</em> and (b) the <em>national question</em>.</p>

<p>The Russian question is involved in the form of (a) Russian
occupation, (b) Stalinist domination of the legal labor movement and
the native Polish regime and (c) the nationalization of the decisive
part of Polish economy.</p>

<p>The national question (which is for Europe but a concrete
manifestation of the broader theoretical problem of retrogression) is
present in the form of (a) a nationally-oppressed country with a
movement for national liberation and(b) a brutal police dictatorship
with a mass struggle for political democracy.</p>

<p>Realizing the key importance of the Polish question to the
programmatic struggle in the international movement, the Workers
Party established its position nearly a year ago. It appeared in the
form of an editorial in our issue of August, 1946. Since then we have
had many occasions to elaborate upon aspects of the Polish question,
mainly through the excellent contributions of our collaborator, A.
Rudzienski. However, we have not had occasion to re-state our
fundamental analysis and basic conclusions. In the absence of such a
restatement, our factional opponents, with a woeful lack of
intellectual integrity in polemics, have so distorted our position in
their desperate efforts to refute it, that we find it necessary to
re-state (and even in part reprint) our position to clarify the
atmosphere before making a polemical reply to these attacks.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Workers Party Analysis</h4>

<p class="fst">Our analysis of the Polish situation can be summed up in the
following points:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>Russian control of Poland is basic to Russia&#8217;s position
in Eastern Europe as well as important to Russian economic needs;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>it is to Russia&#8217;s advantage to rule Poland through a
&#8220;native&#8221; Quisling regime, dominated by a Polish Stalinist
apparatus, rather than by direct Russian military control;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>due to international power relations and to efforts to
placate public opinion in the West, as well as resistance in Poland
itself, Russia is forced temporarily to tolerate a legal opposition
in the form of Mikolajczyk&#8217;s Peasant Party;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>due to the police regime which throttles a free political
life, a vast underground opposition exists;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>this opposition is composed of heterogeneous and
antagonistic elements, as was the wartime anti-German resistance
movement, both in Poland and in Western Europe;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>the only political aim held in common by the entire
opposition is that of national liberation;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>the predominant character of the opposition is that of a
bourgeois-democratic movement, mainly composed of peasants,
reflecting in the underground the political views of the Peasant Party;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>this underground has a strong proletarian wing, with its
main center apparently being the industrial city of Cracow, composed
of old PPS and trade union cadres which refused to submit to the
Stalinist rape of the official labor movement;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>the underground also has a reactionary,
bourgeois-feudal-clerical wing, composed of old Pilsudski elements,
organized in the NSZ;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>the reactionary wing of the underground is increasingly
less important as a political factor as a consequence of its loss of
an economic base through the nationalization of economy and the
breaking-up of large estates and as a consequence of desertions to
the Stalinist state apparatus;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>the actual state power in Poland is Russian imperialist rule;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>the latter seeks to consolidate its rule through the
crystallization of a new bureaucratic class, composed of the
Stalinist political apparatus, the state job-holders, the
Russian-trained officer caste, a section of the old reformist labor
bureaucracy, and the technical personnel of the new nationalized
economy &#8211; a bureaucratic class in the image of the Russian ruling
class but subservient to and dependent upon the latter;<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>the ultimate aim of the Stalinists in Poland is to proceed
by stages to eliminate all opposition and all &#8220;unassimilable&#8221;
elements and achieve a totalitarian state resting upon a
nationalized economy, identical with, and incorporated into, the
Russian political and economic structure.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h4>The Political Conclusions</h4>

<p class="fst">On the basis of this analysis, our <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/vol12/no07/notm2.htm" target="new">original statement</a> offered the following political conclusions:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The new political pattern of Poland consists, therefore,
of a crystallizing bureaucratic class basing itself upon a
nationalized economy and ruling the country by police terror,
accompanied by demagogic gestures to win some proletarian and peasant
support. It is opposed by a broad popular movement of peasants who
rally around the banner of democracy and receive support from such
divergent elements as the reactionary and fascistic former rulers, on
the one hand, and the best socialist elements of the proletariat on
the other.</p>

<p class="quote">This political pattern is no phenomenon peculiar to
Poland, but extends to all the occupied territories. This poses for
the revolutionary Marxists a most critical situation. It gives flesh
and blood to the theoretical question which the movement posed when
it considered Trotsky&#8217;s slogan of self-determination for the
Ukraine. The question is: what is the revolutionary Marxist attitude
toward a broad opposition that rallies under democratic slogans
against a totalitarian regime that bases itself upon nationalized
economy?</p>

<p class="quote">How do the actual forces in conflict pose this
theoretical question? In its crudest form it <em>seems to be</em> the
question of the relative weight of <em>nationalization of economy</em>
against the relative weight of <em>political democracy</em>. This is
becoming one of the touchstone questions of our times. Woe to the
movement that chooses wrongly or seeks to ignore it.</p>

<p class="quote"><em>The revolutionary socialists, of course, want BOTH,
nationalization AND democracy. That is the socialist solution
everywhere. In Russia the struggle for the revolutionary overthrow of
the regime will begin as a struggle for political democracy as the
instrument by which the rudder can again be placed in the hands of
the &#8216;masses. In the United States the struggle for nationalization
of economy is the struggle for the indispensable framework for a
democratic social, economic and political existence for the masses.</em></p>

<p class="quote">But the essence of politics is not merely what we <em>want</em>.
A political line must proceed from the reality of the existing
struggle. The main battle lines are not drawn up between a socialist
proletarian movement and the Stalinist regime, nor between a
socialist proletarian movement and a Mickolajczyk regime. The main
battle lines find the Stalinist dictatorship confronted by a popular
opposition movement headed by Mickolajczyk. Our problem is to create
a Third Camp which will fight both against Stalinist totalitarianism
and the bourgeois reaction inherent in the petty bourgeois peasant
movement. But the question is: where are the elements <em>today</em>
out of which such a Third Camp can be constructed? Are they in the
GPU-staffed, misnamed &#8220;Workers Party&#8221; and the GPU-staffed
government unions? Or are they in the opposition elements grouped
around Mickolajczyk? It is precisely in such a posing of the question
that the difference between the French situation and the Polish
situation comes to the fore. In France the decisive sections of the
proletariat are in the Stalinist and social democratic camp. The
power, however, remains in the hands of the capitalist class. The
class interests of the Stalinist workers require that they engage in
a class struggle with the bourgeoisie and aim toward a proletarian
solution. The Marxists seek to drive this struggle to its ultimate
revolutionary conclusions as a means of breaking the workers from the
Stalinist straightjacket, bound in France as elsewhere by the limits
imposed by Russian needs. In France, therefore, the elements for a
Third Camp are today in the Stalinist and Socialist parties. Without
them there will be no socialist revolution in France.</p>

<p class="quote">In Poland the case is radically different. The
bourgeoisie has, for all practical purposes, been expropriated. The
workers do not engage in a class struggle in industry against a
capitalist owner. Those workers who support the Stalinist regime do
so under the illusion that socialism is being constructed or out of
purely opportunist motives, like jobs or food rations. Those workers,
on the other hand, who wage a class struggle today, do it precisely
<em>against</em> the Stalinist overlords of government and industry. In
order to wage that struggle effectively they must fight for the
democratic rights of existence as a labor movement, the right to free
speech, to organization, to a free press, to assembly, etc., all
finding their final expression in the slogan, &#8220;Out with the
Russians!&#8221; and &#8220;Long live a Free Poland!&#8221; These are rights for
which the vast majority of the Polish population yearns today and
which finds its distorted expression in the Mickolajczyk opposition.
It is here that the revolutionary Marxists will find the decisive
elements for the Third Camp, i.e., a revolutionary, proletarian,
socialist opposition to the Stalinist dictatorship. The political
line of the Marxists must, therefore, be one of critical support to
the Mickolajczyk camp.</p>

<p class="quote">What is meant by &#8220;critical support&#8221;? It means first
of all complete <em>political independence</em> from the Mickolajczyk
movement. It means political criticism of that movement. It means
independent proletarian organizations in the shops and proletarian
methods of struggle, all aimed at wresting the leadership from
Mickolajczyk and making the proletariat the leader of the broad
people&#8217;s movement against the Stalinist regime. The proletariat
cannot remain on the side lines when two sections of the nation stand
locked in deadly struggle.</p>

<p class="quote">If barricades arise between the two camps, on which side
do the Marxists seek to rally the proletariat? In Poland today the
civil war smoulders underground and we must take a position. Do
Polish Marxists condone the GPU arrests of Peasant Party leaders as
being the liquidation of capitalist restorationist elements? Or do
they actively fight alongside of the Peasant Party leaders to defend
them against GPU persecution? For the Marxists, the revolutionary
socialist struggle is the only decisive one in a historic sense.
However, where they cannot determine the nature of the struggle, they
must lead the proletariat, as an independent force, into that camp
which represents the best possibility of socialist advancement.</p>

<p class="fst">We ask our reader&#8217;s indulgence for the necessity of reprinting
this key section of our statement. We are sure, however, that our
readexs, regardless of their political judgment of our position, will
agree that there is a need for such a restatement when our opponents
have chosen to restate our position for us in the following piece of skullduggery:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Shachtman&#8217;s position can be summarized as follows: &#8220;I
consider as primary my right to be able to express my own opinions. I
abandon in advance the attempt to conquer this right <em>within the
framework</em> of the defense, of the expansion, and of the
consummation of expropriation measures against the old possessing
classes. I refuse to get mixed up with those opportunistic workers
who choose their camp solely on the basis of questions of food
rations and of jobs. I am ready to return the factories to the
bourgeois and the land to the landlords on condition that I have
freedom to smear as much paper every week as I desire.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">The above appeared in a polemic against us in the <strong>Fourth
International</strong> of February 1947 under the title of <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1946/11/shachtman.htm" target="new"><em>The Conflict in Poland</em></a> with the sub-title, <em>From Abstentionism to Active Intervention &#8211; In the Camp of the Class Enemy</em>. The author of
this particularly ignorant and vicious piece is one Ernest Germain,
of late, unfortunately, regarded as the leading theoretician of the
Fourth International. We can only list this sad fact as further
evidence of the extent to which Marxian thinking has been lowered in
the world workers&#8217; movement, including its vanguard, the Fourth
International. Yet, since we must assume that Germain&#8217;s article is
the official reply of the leadership of the Fourth International, the
further development of the discussion on this question requires that
we come to grips with this article rather than ignore it and permit
it to pass into the oblivion it deserves.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>On the Nature of State Power</h4>

<p class="fst">Basic to any discussion of whether one should support the state
power or the opposition that seeks its overthrow is the question of
the nature of the state power. We are, therefore, considerably
pleased to note, early in Germain&#8217;s article, a section boldly
entitled, <em>The Class Nature of the Polish State</em>. After telling
us that Shachtman <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> will not succeed in
confounding the &#8220;militants of the Fourth International&#8221; by posing
questions about the nature of the Polish state, and after reminding
us that the question of the nature of a state is not &#8220;a subject for
cheap jokes,&#8221; and that Trotsky devoted twenty pages of <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/revbet/index.htm" target="new"><strong>The Revolution Betrayed</strong></a> to explaining the nature of the Russian state plus forty (!) additional lines for summary, Germain finally launches
into <em>his</em> explanation of the Polish state. He begins by
formulating a broad theoretical precept as to the nature of state
power, the first sentence of which reads:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The nature of the state is dependent in the last analysis
on the class structure of society.</p>

<p class="fst">We take this to mean that the state is the political expression of
the class that is economically dominant. However, as Germain states,
this is true only <em>in the last analysis</em>, i.e., only in the
historical sense and not in every given instance. If it were true in
every given instance there could never be a proletarian revolution.
For the proletariat seizes the state power at a time when the
bourgeoisie is still the dominant class in the economy. &#8220;In the
last analysis&#8221; means, therefore, in so-called normal periods and
above all not in times of revolution and counter-revolution.
Consequently, in the latter periods one cannot determine the class
nature of the state power by examining the economic structure of
society. How then can one determine the class character of a state in
time of revolution and counter-revolution? We shall answer this
question presently, since it contains the powder that blows apart
Germain&#8217;s laborious theoretical structure, which we have not yet
finished examining. Germain continues:</p>

<p class="quoteb">But this structure [the class structure of society] is in
turn reflected in the structure of the state itself and can impose
<em>forms</em> upon it which are in contradiction with the class
interests of the ruling class. (Italics in original &#8211; <em>E.E.</em>)</p>

<p class="fst">If this is not gibberish, then we must take it to mean that the
state does not correspond at <em>all</em> times and in <em>every</em>
respect to the class needs of the dominant class. The state is
subject to the stresses and strains of the class struggle and can
yield to the measure exercised against it from below. This is, of
course, a daily feature in the political life of bourgeois
democracies, especially in those where the direct administrator of
the state is the labor bureaucracy, such as the British Labour
government. In dictatorial regimes, the state, as with all
institutions in the superstructure of society, develops interests of
its own and often imposes these upon the dominant class. The latter
phenomenon Marxists. have long ago given the name of Bonapartism.
Often the political heads of the state, the ideologists of the ruling
class, follow policies in keeping with the <em>historic</em> interests
of the ruling class at the expense of its <em>immediate</em> interests
and a sharp political struggle ensues between the majority of the
ruling class and its state apparatus. The regime of Roosevelt and the
New Deal was an example of the latter.</p>

<p>However, whereas the policies of the state in all of the above
instances &#8220;are in contradiction with the class interests of the
ruling class&#8221; (Germain) <em>they never upset the social order which
gives to the ruling class its dominance</em>. If the policies of the
state systematically destroy the social order of the dominant class,
these policies are part of <em>a social revolution</em> (or
counter-revolution). We do not know what Germain understands by
<em>forms</em>, which he italicizes. If he means <em>political</em> forms
like monarchy, directorate, republic, fascist dictatorship, etc.,
this is quite in keeping with what we have outlined above. What other
possible forms could there be imposed upon &#8220;the structure of the
state&#8221;? Since the state is a <em>political</em> instrument, its forms
can only be political forms. If Germain knows of any other, we wait
to be enlightened.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Germain Sees ... a Bourgeois State</h4>

<p class="fst">What is the purpose of this theoretical introduction to Germain&#8217;s
conclusions about the class nature of the Polish state? Its purpose
is an attempt to prove that the <em>nationalization of economy</em> is
a state form imposed upon the Polish bourgeoisie by its own state.
Or, to put it differently: the fact that the state renders the
bourgeoisie propertyless does not alter the fact that the state is
still a bourgeois state!</p>

<p>We are willing to grant that all manner of contradictions may make
their appearance between the interests of the bourgeoisie and the
policy of the bourgeois state but the one that we shall never see is
precisely the one Germain would have us believe is taking place in
Poland &#8211; a bourgeois state carrying out an economic policy that
removes the bourgeoisie from its dominant place in the economy by
taking away from it the ownership of the means of production, i.e.,
passes the death sentence upon it.</p>

<p>&#8221;But we cannot, in any degree, equate the nationalizations to an
&#8216;expropriation of the bourgeoisie: or to the destruction of
capitalism, which Shachtman seems seriously to imply,&#8221; protests
Germain. Why? Germain tells us why in the very next sentence: &#8220;The
former proprietors are to be indemnified up to the end of ....&#8221;
Take a guess! 1996 perhaps? No! &#8220;... up to the end of 1946!&#8221; And
Germain wrote his article on November 15, 1946, when the Polish
bourgeoisie had a life expectancy, as rentiers of the state, of
exactly six weeks!</p>

<p>But there are additional reasons adduced by Germain. We read on:</p>

<p class="quoteb">A <em>part</em> of these indemnities can be invested in new
<em>private</em> industrial and commercial enterprises, explicitly
authorized by the law. A system of special credit is functioning for
the &#8220;private sector&#8221; of industry and commerce, and is designed to
favor the development of medium and large <em>commercial</em>
enterprises, as well as medium <em>industrial</em> enterprises of
certain sectors (the only ones which can at this time be created by
the Polish bourgeoisie with the capital at its disposal). (Our
italics &#8211; <em>E.E.</em>)</p>

<p class="fst">What does this add up to? To the fact that a <em>part</em> of the
money received from the state may be re-invested. (We do not know
what happens to the other part, but taxes probably account for much
of it.) Where may this part be invested? In commercial enterprises of
both medium and large size. What does this mean? The former
proprietor of a manufacturing plant may open a store, even a big one.
Where else may this remnant of his capital be invested? In industrial
enterprises. In any the capitalist may choose? No. Only in &#8220;certain
sectors&#8221; as &#8220;explicitly authorized by law.&#8221; May he open as
large a plant as he chooses? No, only a medium industrial enterprise.
This is the best he could have done in any case, Germain assures us,
since the Polish capitalist has little capital left. With such a
&#8220;capitalist state&#8221; to look after his welfare, little wonder[ But
then, you see, that is one of the contradictions of which we were
warned in advance. And life is so full of contradictions. Most
anything can happen &#8211; especially in these days, and above all, in Poland.</p>

<p>Of course, capitalism has not been abolished root and branch in
Poland. Who is Germain polemizing against to prove this point?
Certainly not anyone who has written in these pages. Capitalism was
not &#8220;abolished&#8221; in Russia until the first Five Year Plan, and
then not entirely. A well-known expert on Russian affairs recently
wrote in the press of the Fourth International that he had located a
kulak in Novisimbirsk who owned his own cow. And it recently came to
light that there are private watch-repair shops in Moscow itself,
thinly disguised as artisans&#8217; collectives.</p>

<p>What was the NEP in Russia during 1922&#8211;28 but permission for
small and medium capitalist enterprise, particularly in commercial
undertakings, to operate subject to strict regulation by the
government? Nor do we contend that capital in Poland today has been
restricted to channels as narrow as those of the NEP. But the
difference is one of <em>degree</em> and <em>direction</em> and not one
of type. A proletarian state in Poland would not necessarily go
beyond the scope and tempo of nationalization as carried out to date
by the Stalinist regime. The Civil War in Russia necessitated wide
and sweeping measures of expropriation; measures from which the NEP
marked a retreat in the interests of economic rehabilitation. A
workers&#8217; state which is in a position to set its own pace of
nationalization will take proper care not to throw the country into
economic chaos by nationalizing a lot of medium and small industry
and commerce before the economic institutions of the state are in a
position to utilize them properly.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Economy in Poland</h4>

<p class="fst">What then is the nature of the economy in Poland today? Is it
private capitalism? Is it &#8220;state capitalism&#8221;? Is it bureaucratic
collectivism? The nature of the economy is not uniformly anyone of
these. As with every economy in <em>transition</em> from one social
order to another, the Polish economy has a <em>mixed</em> character.
But the real question cannot be answered by determining <em>just how
much</em> is privately owned and <em>just how much</em> is state owned.
Such figures are not without interest, but they cannot answer the key
question: <em>toward what social order is the economy in transition?</em></p>

<p>How can one determine this? In a bourgeois economy which operates
free of hostile state interference, the basic trends are the result
of the inner laws of motion of the economy itself. In this case it
suffices to study the economic trends and generalize upon them. But
where the direction of economic development is not automatic but
state-directed by an anti-bourgeois force, the &#8220;laws of motion&#8221;
arising from the blind working of economic laws can be <em>cancelled
out</em> by the planned intervention of the state.</p>

<p>During the 1920&#8217;s in Russia, the accumulation of kulak and
Nepman capital began to outstrip the accumulation of capital in the
state-owned economy. On the basis of an analysis of economic trends
alone, one would have to say that the further development of the
economy on the basis of these laws of motion could only result in the
complete triumph of capitalism over the nationalized economy. Trotsky
predicted this and proposed a program to prevent it. The essence of
this program was to use the state power over the economy to <em>cancel
out</em> the blind working of &#8220;laws of motion.&#8221; The means by which
this was to be done were two-fold: (a) a planned program of
accumulation of capital for the expansion of the nationalized sector
of the economy and (b) state measures directed against the kulaks and
Nepmen, especially tax measures, which would halt their growth and,
finally, systematically reduce them. Unfortunately, Trotsky believed
that the Stalin bureaucracy was a pro-bourgeois force and incapable
of maintaining the nationalized economy against capitalist pressure.
Trotsky, consequently, failed to foresee that the bureaucracy, also,
could use the state power as an economic force against the capitalist
trends, in the interests of its own special position, without thereby
strengthening the proletariat or moving toward socialism. In line
with his mistaken analysis, Trotsky was forced to regard the Five
Year Plan as a temporary &#8220;left zig&#8221; &#8211; i.e., a pro-Stalinist and
pro-proletarian measure taken under the pressure of the workers &#8211;
on what was otherwise a &#8220;zig-zag&#8221; course toward capitalist
restoration. The sad fact, however, was that while there was less
capitalism than ever in Russia at the end of the Five Year Plan,
there was also less socialism than ever, despite the vast expansion
of the nationalized economy.</p>

<p>If a study of the economic trends alone cannot tell us toward what
the economy is in transition, how can we discover the answer to this
latter question? <em>By analyzing the class nature of the state power
which is determining the direction of economic development.</em></p>

<p>This brings us back to the question we posed earlier but postponed
answering; namely, how does one determine the class nature of state
power in periods of revolution (or counter-revolution) when the state
does not necessarily represent the economically dominant class? One
determines it on the basis of <em>state policy</em> toward the
different classes composing the social order. How did we know that a
workers&#8217; state was at the head of Russian society despite the NEP
concessions to small capital? Because the state policy was
predominantly a pro~proletarian policy. How did we know that the
workers&#8217; state was degenerating? Because its policy increasingly
favored the special interests of the bureaucracy at the expense of
the proletariat.</p>

<p>We must therefore ask: If Germain states that Poland is ruled by
&#8220;a bourgeois Polish State apparatus&#8221; and that &#8220;the structure of
this state remains unchanged&#8221; from that of the pre-war state, why
has the Polish bourgeoisie fared so badly at the hands of its own state?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Which Class Holds Power?</h4>

<p class="fst">The next question which immediately suggests itself is this: which
class has been favored by the state policies in Poland? Before
answering this question, we will first examine another aspect of the
nature of state power to determine in whose hands the Polish state rests.</p>

<p>Germain belligerently asks us:</p>

<p class="quoteb">How were you able to write an editorial of close to 4,000
words on Polish policy without telling us explicitly what is the
class nature of the state and of the society in that country?</p>

<p class="fst">Four pages later in his article, Germain himself quotes our answer:</p>

<p class="quoteb">According to the editorial writer of the <strong>NI</strong>, &#8220;the
Stalinist regime is seeking [!] to compose [!] the new bureaucratic
class from the state apparatus. [The exclamations were inserted by Germain.]</p>

<p class="fst">&#8221;Ah-ha!&#8221; Germain wants to say. &#8220;You see, they are only <em>seeking</em> and want to <em>compose</em> but the editorial writer does not explicitly tell us who holds the state power today.&#8221;</p>

<p>Who holds the state power today? In Poland? Of course, we did not explicitly set
down the answer to this. Because we don&#8217;t know? No! Quite the
contrary, because we were sure that <em>every</em>
schoolboy knew the answer to this question. When we said the &#8220;<em>Stalinist regime</em>
is seeking, etc.,&#8221; whom did Germain think we had in mind? Lest we not be sufficiently
explicit, we will answer at greater length the question of who holds
the state power in Poland today.</p>

<p>What is the state in the last analysis? As Engels was at such
pains to make clear, it is &#8220;an armed power.&#8221; Lest one think this
too narrow a concept, Engels adds that &#8220;it consists not merely of
armed men, but of material appendages, prisons and repressive
institutions of all kinds ...&#8221; And Lenin comments on Engels&#8217;
definition and says somewhat categorically:: CIA standing army and
police are the chief instruments of state power.&#8221;</p>

<p>What standing army is the backbone of state power in Poland? <em>The
Russian army.</em> What police rules the country? <em>The GPU.</em> What
repressive institutions exist? <em>Special courts and concentration
camps for the opponents of Russian rule.</em></p>

<p>We hope that Germain will not quibble about the fact that in
addition to the Russian army of occupation there is also a &#8220;Polish&#8221;
army that wears Polish uniforms and even has officers who speak
Polish without Russian accents. Their arms, however, are Russian,
both in origin and in point of control. We are even willing to grant
that many of the chiefs of the Polish GPU speak Polish. Here,
however, we are not ready to guaran tee that they speak without a
Russian accent.</p>

<p>What is the nature of the state power in Poland today? <em>The
nature of state power is Russian imperialist rule, i.e. occupation,
domination, oppression and exploitation of the country by the
bureaucratic collectivist state power of Russia.</em></p>

<p>This is the bald fact which it seems everybody in the world knows
(whether they call Russia bureaucratic collectivist or not) but
which, it would appear, everybody has carefully withheld from Germain
out of regard for his tender sensibilities.</p>

<p>What is the state power in Japan today? Everyone knows that the
real state power rests upon the American imperialist forces of
occupation. The United States being a capitalist power, it leaves
undisturbed the basic class relations in capitalist Japan. Here there
is no contradiction between the regime of MacArthur and Japanese
capitalism, insofar as their common desire to maintain capitalism is concerned.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>How Is Conflict Being Resolved?</h4>

<p class="fst">But we know that where a contradiction does exist between the
basic social aims of the state (i.e., the armed power) and the
economically dominant class, this contradiction cannot continue
indefinitely. If it did, then the entire Marxist theory that the
state is an instrument of force in the hands of the economically
dominant class would be invalidated. Germain correctly notes, in
connection with another point, that the workers&#8217; state in Russia
ruled for some six to eight months with only few nationalizations.
But this situation could not continue. Either the capitalist owners
of industry would overthrow the Soviet state and again take the state
power or the Soviet state would remove the capitalists from their
economically dominant position by expropriations. If there is a
contradiction between the class aims of the state power in Poland and
those of the bourgeoisie [whom Germain considers still the
economically~dominant class], how is it being resolved? We submit
that all evidence proves that it is being resolved by systematically
removing the bourgeoisie from its role as the &#8220;dominant class&#8221; in
the economy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The character of the state which appears in its structure must
rest, however, on a well defined social base,&#8221; we are told by
Germain. The real state power in Poland, the Russian imperialist
occupant and the native Stalinist~Quisling apparatus through which it
rules, certainly intend to give their state power &#8220;a well defined
social base.&#8221; But other than Germain thinks, it will not be
bourgeois. This latter illusion rests upon yet another theory of the
majority which is basic to their analysis of Poland. This is the
theory that the Russian bureaucracy seeks to restore capitalism in
Russia, and, consequently, to maintain it where it already exists.
For you see, when all is said and done, Germain proceeds not from the
nature of the economy in Poland <em>but from the class aims of the
Russian bureaucracy!</em></p>

<p>But the political intervention of the Soviet bureaucracy was
primarily <em>counter-revolutionary</em>. The Soviet Army was used to
&#8220;restore order,&#8221; re-establish the authority of employers and to
rapidly rebuild a <em>bourgeois</em> Polish state apparatus.</p>

<p>Here we can clearly see that the Polish question is
indistinguishable from the Russian question. How can it be otherwise
when the real state in Poland is the Russian military power plus its
native apparatus? The analysis of the Polish situation, therefore,
cannot be the same for those who see a workers&#8217; state in Russia as
for those who see bureaucratic collectivism or state capitalism in Russia.</p>

<p>The above quotation reveals that those who hold the view that
Russia is a workers&#8217; state and that the only alternative is the
restoration of private capitalism can only equate counterrevolution
to <em>bourgeois</em> counter-revolution. If the &#8220;Red Army&#8221; enters
Poland to suppress in incipient proletarian revolution, Germain can
only conclude that it does this in order to place the bourgeoisie in
power. That the Russian army may smash a proletarian revolution and
simultaneously move to eliminate the bourgeoisie is ruled out as
&#8220;Shachtmanite&#8221; revisionism (and in more truculent moods as Burnhamism).</p>

<p>According to the majority theory the Russian bureaucracy plays a
<em>dual</em> role: reactionary and progressive, i.e., pro-capitalist
and pro-socialist. It is either one or the other. If it suppresses a
proletarian revolution, it must be pro-capitalist. If it divides the
land and nationalizes economy, it must be pro-socialist. Accepting
this mode of reasoning for the moment, we ask Germain this question:
If one casts up a balance sheet of the Russian record in Poland,
placing all the &#8220;progressive&#8221; acts in one column and the
reactionary ones in another, which reveals itself as the decisive
class policy, the pro-capitalist or the &#8220;pro-socialist&#8221; measures?</p>

<p>What have been the pro-capitalist measures in Poland cited by
Germain? The Russians (a) saved the Polish bourgeoisie from a
proletarian revolution and (b) generously permitted the bourgeoisie
to keep its small and, to an extent, medium enterprises.</p>

<p>What have been the &#8220;pro-socialist&#8221; measures according to
Germain? The Russians (a) nationalized banking and the key industries
and (b) broke up the remaining landed estates. In the words of
Germain, &#8220;the total expropriation of the bourgeoisie after an
eventual conquest of power by the proletariat presents itself as
infinitely easier and requiring less expense than in 1939&#8221; and
therefore &#8220;economically, socially and technically the reforms of
1945&#8211;46 <em>facilitate</em> the realization of the socialist revolution.&#8221;</p>

<p>Can one assume anything else from this balance sheet than that the
<em>decisive</em> class policy in Poland has been anything <em>but</em>
pro-bourgeois? Germain could conceivably conclude that the policy has
been &#8220;pro-socialist,&#8221; but hardly pro-bourgeois.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Russia&#8217;s Aim of Structural Assimilation</h4>

<p class="fst">We cite one more item of evidence from Germain to bolster this
conclusion. In explaining the reasons for the nationalization policy,
he sums them up as: &#8220;... workers&#8217; pressure; the tendency toward
statism inherent in Polish capitalist industry; <em>the tendency
toward structural assimilation inherent in the policy of the Soviet
bureaucracy in the &#8216;buffer&#8217; countries</em>.&#8221; (Our italics &#8211; <em>E.E.</em>)</p>

<p>We ask: if it is the aim of the Russian bureaucracy to assimilate
the Polish economy &#8220;into the structure of the USSR,&#8221; will this be
done on the basis of a Polish <em>bourgeois</em> economy? How could a
bourgeois economy be grafted onto the collectivized economy of
Russia? Or does Germain see in this, as did Oehler a few years ago,
the secret design of the Kremlin to bring capitalism back into
Russia? &#8220;Structural assimilation&#8221; to Russia! This is a most
gloomy perspective which the Polish bourgeois state has outlined for
the Polish bourgeoisie! Never has the &#8220;executive committee of the
bourgeoisie as a whole shown such disregard for the most basic
interests of its constituents, including their very lives!<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Comparison of Poland and Spain</h4>

<p class="fst">But Germain cites us an historical precedent for what is taking
place in Poland. What is the precedent? The Loyalist government in
Spain during the Civil War. Here, he says was a bourgeois state which
fought the bourgeois as a class, the vast majority of the latter
having been in the camp of Franco. Germain, however, omits one item
from his analogy between Poland and Spain of 1936&#8211;39. The entire
activity of the Republican government after July 18, 1936, was not
merely to oust the workers from the control they had established in
industry, but to conduct <em>a consistent policy of restoring the
property to the bourgeoisie</em>. This latter policy was most ardently
pursued by the Spanish Stalinists, under the direct orders of the
Russian Ambassador in Madrid. Those bourgeois who had fled abroad but
had not taken an active part in the Franco rebellion were even
invited to return and resume their bourgeois functions.</p>

<p>Why did the Spanish bourgeoisie encourage the Franco uprising? Was
it because the People&#8217;s Front regime was going to expropriate them?
No. It was because they viewed the Republican government as too weak
to prevent a proletarian revolution. They viewed Azana as the Russian
bourgeoisie viewed Kerensky and, like the Russian bourgeoisie, the
Spanish sought its own &#8220;Kornilov,&#8221; unfortunately, a victorious
one. Does any Polish bourgeois oppose the present Warsaw government
because it is weak in the face of a threatening proletarian and
peasant upheaval? They could find no stronger counter-revolutionary
regime than the one now in power. However, a regime that saves the
bourgeoisie from the proletariat only in order to expropriate the
bourgeoisie itself is of little consolation to the latter. The
Stalinist course in Spain was anti-proletarian and pro-bourgeois. The
Stalinist course in Poland is anti-proletarian <em>and</em>
anti-bourgeois and pro-bureaucratic collectivist. They find
themselves able to achieve in Poland today what was out of the
question in Spain &#8211; namely to recast Polish society in the image of Russia.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Russia&#8217;s &#8220;Children&#8221;</h4>

<p class="quoteb">As a consequence, Shachtman asserts that the &#8220;unique&#8221;
Russian bureaucratic class can produce children &#8211; &#8220;intentionally,&#8221;
of course, in order to insist on the determinist and historical
character of this strange &#8220;sociology,&#8221; which continues out of
laziness of thought to call itself &#8220;Marxist&#8221;! We have the right
to ask him: And the French Stalinists, wouldn&#8217;t they, too, like to
form a &#8220;new bureaucratic class,&#8221; if God furnishes the occasion?</p>

<p class="fst">Yes, Germain may as well know the worst; the Russian
bureaucratic-collectivist class can &#8220;produce children.&#8221; Not only
&#8220;intentionally&#8221; but also &#8220;necessarily.&#8221; <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>
What is at the root of the Russian expansion into the
&#8220;buffer-states,&#8221; according to the position which Germain holds?
At the root is the bureaucracy&#8217;s concept of how to defend the
&#8220;Soviet Union.&#8221; The very term &#8220;buffer&#8221; indicates this. But
what is a more reliable buffer-territory, one with a bourgeois
economy or one with a nationalized economy? Obviously, the latter.
Yugoslavia is certainly more reliable than Finland in case of an·
American attack upon Russia. If the antagonism between Russia and the
capitalist world rests upon two mutually hostile social systems, why
should Russia <em>desire</em> to have the <em>enemy</em> social system
behind its first line of defense (the iron curtain) and extending
right up to the frontiers of Russia itself? We speak of &#8220;desire&#8221;
here for it is Germain&#8217;s contention that Russia <em>seeks</em> to
restore and maintain capitalism in Poland. We credit the Kremlin, if
solely from an aim of self-preservation, with enough foresight to
have the &#8220;intentions&#8221; of extending its social system throughout
the buffer territory.</p>

<p>However, more than that, Russia finds it <em>necessary</em> to
expand imperialistically due to her own economic needs. We dealt with
this at length in an editorial in the April 1946 issue of this
publication. The same point is made in different terminology in the
<strong>Fourth International</strong> (March 1946) where we read on page 103 as
follows: &#8220;The regime [in Russia] sees no way out in the economic
field save through the realization of the fourth Five-Year Plan,
which cannot be achieved by the devastated country without the
resources of the &#8216;buffer zones&#8217;.&#8221; Most certainly &#8220;the
resources of the buffer zones&#8221; cannot be exploited by continual
looting. They must be geared into the economy of Russia. This is what
Germain speaks of when he refers to the Russian aim of &#8220;structural
assimilation.&#8221; What will these &#8220;assimilated&#8221; states be other
than &#8220;children&#8221; of the Russian bureaucratic collectivist system?
E.R. Frank, in his study of the buffer-states, admits that
Yugoslavia looks terribly much like Russia already, though he also
gags at calling it one of the &#8220;children.&#8221;</p>

<p>If capitalism is everywhere in decline, it is at its most feeble
stage precisely in this buffer zone of Russia. Short of a war, this
territory is lost to capitalism. The latter system no longer has the
dynamism to make a comeback here. Certainly, Germain would be one of
the last to predict an economic resurgence of world capitalism that
would sweep over into these states. The only capitalist resurgence
that is possible lies along the path indicated by Truman&#8217;s
intervention in the Eastern Mediterranean &#8211; military might. Unless
the proletarian revolution intervenes with its solution to the
desperate situation of these nations, the vacuum will be filled by
Russian policy &#8211; ending in bureaucratic-totalitarian rule by a new
exploiting class that basis itself upon a nationalized economy.</p>

<p>But in France, too? mockingly asks Germain. Yes, the French
Stalinists, too, seek to develop bureaucratic class rule, and &#8220;if
God furnishes the occasion,&#8221; they will. This occasion, however, we
do not see in France today nor for a long time to come. If it
materializes, it will not only denote a crushing defeat of the
European proletariat at the hands of Stalinism but it will also be
the signal for the outbreak of the Russo-American war for world
supremacy.</p>

<p>Why should the fact that the French Stalinists seek bureaucratic
class rule of their own strike Germain as extremely preposterous? He
should be well acquainted with the following quotation:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The predominating type among the present &#8220;Communist&#8221;
bureaucrats is the political careerist, and in consequence the polar
opposite of the revolutionist. Their ideal is to attain in their own
country the same position that the Kremlin oligarchy gained in the
USSR. They are not the revolutionary leaders of the proletariat but
aspirants to totalitarian rule. They dream of gaining success with
the aid of this same Soviet bureaucracy and its GPU. They view with
admiration and envy the invasion of Poland, Finland, the Baltic
states, Bessarabia by the Red Army because these invasions
immediately bring about the transfer of power into the hands of the
local Stalinist candidates for totalitarian rule. (Leon Trotsky, [<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1940/08/gpu.htm" target="new"><em>The Comintern and the GPU</em></a>], <strong>The
Fourth International</strong>, November 1940)</p>

<p class="fst">You see, this &#8220;strange &#8216;sociology: which continues out of
laziness of thought to call itself &#8216;Marxist&#8217;&#8221; did not even
originate with us! We deem it far less &#8220;strange&#8221; than that
sociology which sees the class aim of the bureaucracy of the
&#8220;workers&#8217; state&#8221; to be the rebuilding of the &#8220;bourgeois
Polish State apparatus&#8221; by means of nationalizing the economy and
partitioning the land. We cannot refrain from noting that the Russian
bureaucracy, no doubt, does this &#8220;intentionally&#8221; to help poor
Germain resolve the many theoretical contradictions he finds himself in.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Shachtman&#8217;s View in 1941</h4>

<p class="fst">But Shachtman did not say that the Russian state could produce
children when he first developed his theory of bureaucratic
collectivism in 1941, complains Germain. This is not entirely true.
For the Russian state already had produced several children by that
time. Esthonia, Latvia and Lithuania were small nations but they were
nations nevertheless and as capitalist as many another. Russian
occupation, however, did not &#8220;rapidly rebuild a bourgeois
[Esthonian, Latvian or Lithuanian] state apparatus.&#8221; It recast
these nations in its own image of bureaucratic collectivism, or as
Germain would have it, it &#8220;structurally assimilated&#8221; them. The
assimilation has been so thorough that these nations have almost
passed out of the memory of mankind.</p>

<p>Shachtman would have flown in the face of well-known facts (and
facts which helped his case rather than weakened it) to deny that
bureaucratic collectivism in Russia could have offspring. What our
resolution on Russia in 1941 did say was that the Second World War
would be decisive in the great contest between the proletariat and
the bourgeoisie and that regardless of which won, the bureaucratic
collectivist class would have an equally limited future. History has
proven that we were one-sided and therefore wrong on this score. We
were wrong not because we believed in the theory of bureaucratic
collectivism, but because we did not fully comprehend and develop all
the ramifications of this theory and continued to operate on many of
the false concepts laid down by Trotsky on the Russian question. The
result of the war was (a) the failure of t!le proletarian
revolutionary wave to reach even the heights of 1917&#8211;23, (b) the
terrible disorganization and disintegration of capitalism in Europe
and (c) the emergence of Russia as the second greatest world power,
supported in Europe by mass Stalinist parties. Rather than a limited
future, bureaucratic collectivism today enters the lists as a
powerful contender against both capitalism and the proletarian
revolution. We took note of this changed relationship in the
<a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/vol13/no04/wp.html" target="new"><em>International Resolution</em></a> of our party convention of May 1946 and stated that the future of bureaucratic collectivism was not
absolutely decided but would be resolved in struggle. We seek to
effect the outcome of this struggle by being active participants.</p>

<p>That is why we remain unrattled when Germain, after noting that we
see Poland as the pattern for the other states of the buffer zone,
asks: &#8220;Does he [Shachtman] perhaps think that King Michael finds
himself at the head of &#8211; a bureaucratic state?&#8221; A pattern
according to the dictionary is &#8220;anything cut out or formed into
shape <em>to be copied</em>.&#8221; Stalin works with the easiest material
first, i.e., Poland and Yugoslavia. Rumania, together with King
Michael, will have their turn in being cut to the pattern. Meanwhile
Stalin has use for King Michael &#8211; who has about as much power in
Rumanian affairs as Kalinin had in Russia, a good deal less, in fact.
Stalin has use for all kinds of conscious and unconscious
collaborators &#8211; from the Metropolitan of the Holy Synod in Moscow
to those who call upon the Polish masses to defend the Stalinist
police regime against the bourgeois democratic peasant movement. As
to the number of countries in which, and the extent to which, the
&#8220;pattern&#8221; will be used, this &#8211; we repeat &#8211; will be decided
iIn struggle.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#f1" name="n1">1.</a> Throughout the article, Germain
chooses to speak of &#8220;Shachtman&#8221; rather than the Workers Party.
thus giving the impression of a polemic directed against an
individual rather than a party which represents a counter-position to
that of the majority in the international movement; e.g., &#8220;The

suspect that Germain is unconsciously expressing a view found in some
quarters of the movement that parties are merely appendages to

of course, flows from its basic views on the Russian and national questions.</p>
