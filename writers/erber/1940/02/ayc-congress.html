<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="fst">Here are a few of the pertinent facts and highlights
of the February 9&ndash;12 &ldquo;National Citizenship Institute&rdquo;
of the American Youth Congress:</p>

<p class="fst"><b>1. REPRESENTATION:</B> Some 4,600 &ldquo;delegates&rdquo;
registered who, the AYC leaders claimed; represented over four
million young people. About a thousand or so were delegates from
various <I>bona-fide</I> national and local organizations in which
members of the Young Communist League are active. Among these
organizations were Stalinist-dominated AFL and CIO locals, Industrial
Girls Clubs and Business and Professional Women&rsquo;s Clubs of the
Young Women&rsquo;s Christian Association. Then there were delegates
from the Stalinist peripheral organizations: American Student Union,
youth sections of the Workers Alliance, the International Workers
Order, the International Labor Defense, the Finnish Workers
Federation, Armenian Workers Federation, etc. Then came delegates
from hundreds of organizations with dubious names like the Modern
Youth Group, the Williamsburg Youth Center, the Streamlined Dance
Group, etc. In a word, the vast majority of the &ldquo;delegates&rdquo;
were members or sympathizers of the Young Communist League;</p>

<p class="fst"><b>2. PROCEDURE:</B> The entire two-day &ldquo;Institute&rdquo;
was controlled by the top leadership of the AYC with a firm hand.
Neither speakers nor resolutions were permitted from the floor.
&ldquo;Discussion&rdquo; was organized by having delegates submit a
slip of paper with their name and organization to the platform. A
&ldquo;Trotskyite&rdquo; delegate had as much chance of getting by
the committee on the platform as a snowball in hell. Ushers and
police took care of anyone attempting to speak from the floor.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>3. PRESIDENT&rsquo;S SPEECH:</B> The delegates,
paraded down Pennsylvania Avenue in a drizzling rain on Saturday
morning, displaying banners with all the slogans which the Stalinists
are currently stressing, &ldquo;The Yanks Ain&rsquo;t Coming,&rdquo;
&ldquo;For the American Youth Act,&rdquo; &ldquo;Not a Dime for
Mannerheim,&rdquo; &ldquo;Keep America Out of the Imperialist War,&rdquo;
and so on.</p>

<p>The parade ended on the White House lawn; where
arrangements had been made for an address by the President. The
delegates waited for a half hour in a rain that had become a downpour
to listen to Roosevelt denounce the Soviet Union as a dictatorship in
no way different than any other and call for American support to
Finland. The speech brought slight response from the delegates. At
one point the crowd began to boo, and the radio operators were forced
to cut out all microphones except those into which the President was
speaking directly.</p>

<p>The thousands of YCLers were a sorry sight as they
trudged back, wet, cold and miserable after Roosevelt&rsquo;s
tongue-lashing.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>4. THE LEWIS SPEECH:</B> John L. Lewis decided to
address the Congress only on the day before he spoke. Speaking to the
delegates only some three hours after the President, Lewis&rsquo;
speech was greeted with thunderous ovations. The bitter sarcasm he
poured upon the President&rsquo;s remarks appeared as vindication to
the delegates for the abuse they had suffered in the morning.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>5. TREATMENT OF AUBREY WILLIAMS:</B> Coming right
after Lewis&rsquo; eventful speech, the speech of Aubrey Williams,
director of the National Youth Administration, received scant
attention from the press. Williams devoted the first part of his
speech to the economic needs of youth and surpassed any of the
invited speakers in the &ldquo;radicalism&rdquo; of his demands. He
referred to the $500,000,000 appropriation requested in the American
Youth Act as &ldquo;insufficient&rdquo; and called for billions of
dollars to finance a program to &ldquo;rehouse America&rdquo; and
&ldquo;put youth to work at useful occupations.&rdquo; However; when,
at the close of his remarks, he sought to justify his action of
turning over the NYA lists to the Army Recruiting Office, he was
greeted with such a storm of boos, and hisses that it became
impossible to continue his speech. He explained that he had nothing
against militarism as such but that &ldquo;militarism must be
subordinated to democracy.&rdquo; This brought forth renewed booing
from the young Stalinists, who, only a half year ago, printed
articles in the <B>Young Communist Review</B> on the advantages of
life in the U.S. Army.</p>

<p class="fst"><b>6. MRS. ROOSEVELT&rsquo;S SPEECH:</B> Visibly
nervous and tense, Mrs. Roosevelt answered a series of questions at
the session on <I>The International Scene</I> on Sunday night. Her
remarks were the climax to participation in the previous sessions and
an active support to practical arrangements. Over a hundred delegates
were put up at the White House, in addition to other hundreds that
she provided with accommodations at the homes of Mrs. Cordell Hull
and other wives of government officials, at army barracks and a girls
school, and through negotiations with the hotel managers association
to lower rates.</p>

<p>Mrs. Roosevelt grimly sat on the platform through
speeches by Frederick &ldquo;Blackie&rdquo; Myers, Communist Party
whip in the National Maritime Union, an Indian &ldquo;nationalist&rdquo;
named Luis Perez of the &ldquo;Brotherhood of Cuban Youth,&rdquo; and
other speakers who followed the political form of the current <B>Daily
Worker</B> attacks upon Roosevelt. After the first speaker of what
the chairman announced would be a panel of five youths on the subject
of <I>How the War Affects Me</I> had concluded with a continuation of
the attacks upon Roosevelt as a war-monger, Mrs. Roosevelt, without
waiting to be introduced, strode to the rostrum and prepared to
speak. The chairman solved the situation by simply announcing, &ldquo;I
present, Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt.&rdquo;</p>
