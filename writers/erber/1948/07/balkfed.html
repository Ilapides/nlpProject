<p class="fst"><B>Tito&rsquo;s main aim in his opposition to Moscow emerged more
 clearly in the past week in the form of a series of moves designed to
 force Stalin to permit Yugoslavia an independent role within the
 Russian bloc, with the opportunity of building a Balkan federation.</B></P>
<P><I>It has become apparent that Tito is banking heavily upon the
 strategic position occupied by Yugoslavia in the Russian defense
 system to force Stalin to accept Tito&rsquo;s terms and keep
 Yugoslavia as an ally, rather than lose her to the Western powers.</I></P>
<P>This supposition assumes that Stalin will consider the military
 loss entailed by Yugoslavia&rsquo;s going over to the Western camp to
 be more dangerous than the political loss entailed by granting Tito
 an independent role within the bloc.</P>
<P>The military effects of a complete break with Yugoslavia would be
 exceedingly serious for Russia. Yugoslavia protects the southwestern
 flank of the Russian empire. In actuality, Yugoslavia protects more.
 It is the key to the Balkans and the Danube valley. Were Yugoslavia,
 together with Albania, to become a base for the American bloc, the
 Hungarian, Rumanian and Bulgarian plains would be difficult to defend
 in time of war. A successful thrust to the east would place Russia&rsquo;s
 enemies on the shores of the Black Sea. A successful thrust to the
 north would place Russia in danger of losing the rich industrial
 regions in western Czechoslovakia. The immediate effect of losing
 Yugoslavia to the West would be the virtual liquidation of the civil
 war in Greece, for which Yugoslavia is the main base of operations on
 the Stalinist side.</P>
<P>In a counterblast addressed to the Czech, Bulgarian and Hungarian
 Stalinist leaders, Milovan Djilas, Tito&rsquo;s propaganda chief,
 said:</P>
<p class="quoteb"><i>&ldquo;We do not feel isolated. This conclusion may
 seem funny to you. But we do not feel isolated, because we arc
 convinced that the Soviet Union will not and cannot abandon
 Yugoslavia in her relations with the imperialists.</I></p>
<p class="quote">&ldquo;This arises from the Soviet Union&rsquo;s
 anti-imperialist policy. Besides this, the Soviet Union is an
 existing reality and not an abstraction and is the leading
 peace-loving power. Yugoslavia takes that into account as a realistic
 factor in today&rsquo;s relations and has no reason to feel that she
 is being abandoned to the imperialists.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="fst">Djilas sought to underscore his view that Russia has no
 alternative but to maintain the alliance by comparing it to a
 marriage that brings a couple together &ldquo;for better or for
 worse.&rdquo;<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Tito&rsquo;s Immediate Aims</H4>
<p class="fst">Djilas&rsquo; reference to Russia as &ldquo;the leading
 peace-loving power&rdquo; and such similar remarks are, of course,
 mere observance of the ritual of the Stalinist faith. The essence of
 his argument is the remark that Russia &ldquo;will not <I>and cannot</I>&rdquo;
 permit Yugoslavia to join the West.</P>
<P><I>It is of the highest significance that Tito&rsquo;s statements
 have been addressed, mainly, to the Bulgarian, Hungarian and Czech
 Stalinist leaders. He is saying to them, in effect, that they too can
 assert themselves against Russia without fear that Russia will
 abandon them to the Western powers.</I></P>
<P>This approach links up with Tito&rsquo;s program for a Balkan
 federation, a proposal severely condemned by Moscow when it was
 advanced by Dimitrov in Bulgaria last year. Tito&rsquo;s Balkan
 federation can only be realized, therefore, against the will of
 Moscow and as a result of Bulgaria, at least, following in the
 footsteps of Yugoslavia in asserting its freedom of action against
 Russia.</P>
<P><I>Tito&rsquo;s immediate aims are for a federation of Yugoslavia,
 Bulgaria and Albania. However, Stalin is well aware that such a
 federation would only be a stepping-stone toward the inclusion of
 Hungary, Czechoslovakia and, ultimately, Rumania. A federation of
 such dimensions, which Tito, of course, hopes to boss, would
 represent a considerable concentration of economic and military
 power. Though its industrial base would be relatively weak, it would
 certainly not be less, and probably would be more, than Russia
 possessed at the start of the first Five Year Plan. Tito may dream of
 several five-year plans establishing an extensive industrial base for
 such a Balkan-Danubian federation.</I></P>
<P>It is interesting to note in this connection that Djilas stated
 that he would leave unanswered the question of whether Yugoslavia had
 sufficient strength to build socialism without the help of the other
 &ldquo;socialist nations,&rdquo; but stated that it would be strange
 if the others were to force Yugoslavia to prove that she can or
 cannot build socialism herself. The underlying thought in Djilas&rsquo;
 reference to other countries is not about whether Russia helps
 Yugoslavia, but whether the Balkan and Danubian countries do. Djilas
 is here appealing to the widely known resentment, which even the
 Stalinist leaders of the Russian puppet states feel, against Russia&rsquo;s
 draining the economies of its satellites for her own needs. Tito
 seeks to hold out the prospect of the Balkan and Danubian countries
 pooling their resources to build up the economy of the proposed
 federation, and carrying on economic relations with Russia as equals.
 Such a relationship would almost nullify the great economic potential
 Russian imperialism established for itself in Southeastern Europe.</P>
<P>It is, above all, the far-reaching implications of Tito&rsquo;s
 fight for an independent role that may cause Stalin to consider
 seriously the alternative of an all-out struggle to force Tito&rsquo;s
 capitulation, even risking the loss of Yugoslavia to the West. Stalin
 thoroughly realizes, as does Tito also and all others who know the
 inner mechanism of the Stalinist state and party system, that the
 latter would receive their death blow if two totalitarian power
 centers existed in the Iron Curtain world.</P>
<P><I>As <a href="tito-stalin.html" target="new">we explained last week</a>, the existence of two centers means
 two policies and a struggle for domination in the world Stalinist
 movement. Yet such a struggle would shatter one of the indispensable
 pillars of the Stalinist&rsquo; system &ndash; monolithism. Tito&rsquo;s
 defiance of the Cominform has already given evidence of this result.
 A fierce internal struggle has broken out in the Communist Party of
 Trieste, between a Stalin majority and a Tito minority. Without a
 doubt, pro-Tito wings will take form in the CPs of the neighboring
 countries, just as a pro-Stalin wing will oppose itself to Tito in
 the Yugoslavian CP.</I></P>
<P>These deep-going threats, which Tito&rsquo;s program represents,
 may yet cause Stalin to choose the loss of Yugoslavia to the West as
 the lesser of two evils. Though such a course would mean an
 immeasurable weakening of Russia&rsquo;s military situation, it would
 permit the Kremlin to consolidate what remains and integrate it even
 more closely into the Russian political and economic order.</P>
