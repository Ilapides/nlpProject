<p class="fst">The bulk of both the Cominform attack upon Tito and Tito&rsquo;s
 reply is composed of demagogical charges aimed at securing support in
 the ranks of the Yugoslavian Communist Party and among Stalinists in
 the rest of the world. However, buried between the lines of both
 documents are enough clues to compose a fairly comprehensive picture
 of what is at stake. A knowledge of Stalinism and its internal
 structure should cause any competent observer to dismiss all the
 charges of &ldquo;Trotskyism,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bukharinism,&rdquo;
 ideological deviations on the role of the party, lack of internal
 party democracy, &ldquo;Turkish rule,&rdquo; tactical errors in
 nationalization, etc., and seek the basic causes of Stalin&rsquo;s
 concern over Tito&rsquo;s role and the latter&rsquo;s intransigent
 defiance of the Kremlin.</P>
<P><I>Stalin&rsquo;s main concern is over Tito&rsquo;s independence
 of Moscow dictation, regardless of whether this exerts itself in
 questions of major or of minor importance to Russia. It is part of
 the very essence of Stalinism that it cannot tolerate 99 per cent
 loyalty. A totalitarian structure demands TOTAL acceptance. Anything
 less than this is dangerous and must be overcome. If it cannot be
 corrected through pressure, it must be fought and &ldquo;destroyed&rdquo;.</I></P>
<P>The identification of &ldquo;rule or ruin&rdquo; as the basic
 operational principle of Stalinism may be an over-simplification, but
 basically it describes the only final alternatives before Stalinism
 in its relations with any other force, including those that are 99
 per cent Stalinist.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Cannot Be an Equal</H4>
<p class="fst">This factor works with special importance in the Kremlin&rsquo;s
 relations with its satellite states. Russia can only tolerate a
 nation as a &ldquo;sphere of influence&rdquo; while in the process of
 reducing it to a complete puppet. It cannot achieve a status quo in
 its relations with another state on the basis of a division of power,
 such as capitalist imperialists have done historically.</P>
<P><I>The capitalist imperialists have succeeded in maintaining
 certain nations as their &ldquo;sphere of influence,&rdquo; like the
 United States in Latin America, for long periods of history because
 the domination of capitalist imperialism is basically an ECONOMIC
 one. Russian imperialism can only dominate through its military and
 political power, the latter exercised through its control of the
 international Stalinist apparatus which is essentially a secret
 police network. Every evidence of independence on the part of the
 satellite state, consequently, is tantamount to rebellion.</I></P>
<P>Were Tito to succeed in establishing even a measure of
 independence, every puppet leadership in the Russian empire would
 seek to do the same. To permit Tito to &ldquo;become an equal,&rdquo;
 as he insists, would mean the beginning of the disintegration of the
 entire web of Stalinist control. A comprehension of this fact
 explains what has puzzled so many commentators, namely, why Stalin
 acted so precipitously and so brutally against Tito. Stalin, like
 every authoritarian, knows that a system that rests upon authority
 dares not temporize with those who defy it. Disaffection in the ranks
 must be wiped out, quickly and decisively, lest it spread and become
 unmanageable. Stalin&rsquo;s relation to the Yugoslavian assertion of
 rights to independence is the same as that of a military commander to
 mutiny in the ranks. To temporize with it, to negotiate with it, to
 compromise with it, can only destroy the system as such.</P>
<P><I>For Stalin to permit Tito any degree of autonomy is to permit
 Tito to influence the other Communist parties in his own right and in
 possible opposition to Russia. Stalinism cannot survive under these
 circumstances. It must remain monolithic or not exist. Stalinist
 parties cannot be confronted with a choice between a Stalin policy
 and a Tito policy. Such a situation requires party democracy,
 discussion and a democratic vote&mdash;all of them tantamount to a
 death sentence to Stalinism.</I></P>
<P>As a nation on the border between the Russian empire and the West
 and as a nation that is not occupied by Russian troops, Yugoslavia&rsquo;s
 assertion of independent rights is especially dangerous, since it
 raises the specter of Belgrade seeking to play a diplomatic role of
 its own between Russia and the Anglo-American bloc. The Kremlin can
 tolerate a nation seeking to play such a role if that nation is not
 yet fully under Stalinist control but in the process of being
 coordinated, as was the case with Czechoslovakia. Russia permitted
 Prague to make gestures of diplomatic independence, because Moscow
 knew that such gestures would be made on a decreasing, not an
 increasing, scale. Stalin could afford to wait patiently, because he
 knew that Czechoslovakia would soon be &ldquo;in the bag.&rdquo;
 However, the reverse process was taking place with Yugoslavia. It was
 escaping &ldquo;the bag.&rdquo; Patience and toleration could only
 facilitate its escape. What was required was swift and drastic
 action. The Cominform resolution was the result.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Self-Interests Endangered</H4>
<p class="fst">In seeking to understand what motivated Tito, one must begin from
 the premise that no ruling class willingly submits to dictation from
 another power when it receives nothing in return. The <I>compradore</I>
 classes in colonial countries have traditionally accepted imperialist
 domination of their foreign policy and; in less measure, their
 domestic policy, because the dominant imperialist power provided them
 with economic advantages by permitting them to share in the
 exploitation of the material and human resources of the country.</P>
<P><I>Russia had nothing to offer to Yugoslavia in this sphere. It
 could only take from it and give nothing in return. Furthermore,
 Yugoslavia was forced to deny herself the economic advantages of
 unrestricted trade with the capitalist world, not to speak of the
 possibility of Marshall Plan aid, solely in the interests of Russia&rsquo;s
 strategy against the western imperialists. The new bureaucratic
 ruling class of Yugoslavia would tolerate this situation only as long
 as it was forced to tolerate it. As soon as Tito felt safe in doing
 so, he began to cast loose from his Russian moorings and seek means
 of resolving his problems at home without regard for Russian
 interests.</I></P>
<P>Aside from the fact that no ruling class plays an altruistic role
 and pursues its own interests whenever possible, Tito found himself
 in a position where adherence to Russia&rsquo;s interests at the
 expense of those of Yugoslavia endangered his own regime. The
 deep-seated national sentiments of the Yugoslav peoples, fired by
 their liberation struggle against Germany, were not conducive to
 acceptance of subordination to the interests of Russia.</P>
<P>The references in the Cominform document to &ldquo;a hateful
 policy toward the Soviet Union&rdquo; on the part of the Tito
 leadership have their origins in this attitude. Tito came to power as
 a Yugoslavian hero and exploited nationalism in the most shameless
 manner to consolidate his regime. Much of his mass support and a
 large section of the officialdom is heavily saturated with such
 Yugoslavian nationalism, only slightly varnished over with devotion
 to Stalin&rsquo;s version of internationalism. A policy that ran
 counter to these sentiments would find mounting dissatisfaction in
 the ranks of Tito&rsquo;s supporters and undermine his position.<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Economic Crisis</H4>
<p class="fst">Another factor that forced Tito&rsquo;s hand was the economic
 crisis in the country, related in the minds of a large section of the
 population to the economic measures forced upon Yugoslavia as part of
 the Molotov Plan for Eastern Europe and to Tito&rsquo;s program of
 &ldquo;Sovietization&rdquo; of the country. Though Tito carried
 through further measures of extreme nationalization of small shops
 and trade as late as April 27, measures which practically wiped out
 any enterprise employing labor, he has followed an extremely moderate
 policy in reference to the peasants, who form the overwhelming
 majority of the population and furnish the regime with a large part
 of its mass support. An active policy of collectivization on the
 Russian pattern would jeopardize this base. The accusation of the
 Cominform that the Yugoslavian CP is a &ldquo;pro-kulak&rdquo; party
 stems from this situation.</P>
<P><I>The possibility of a breakaway by one of the satellites was not
 ignored by Moscow. However, their means of preventing it were
 limited, in the main, to infiltration of the Yugoslavian party and
 state apparatus with secret agents, directly under Moscow direction.
 Tito was fully aware of this technique of Moscow control and took
 steps to offset it by pitting his own secret police, the OZNA,
 against the GPU operatives. The Cominform document&rsquo;s charge
 that Cominform representatives in Yugoslavia, including its head
 representative, Judin, together with Russian military and technical
 specialists, were kept under constant surveillance by Yugoslavian
 police agents, is rooted in this situation.</I></P>
<P>The reply of Tito to this charge confirms the fact that the secret
 police played a decisive role in Moscow&rsquo;s efforts to control
 the Tito regime. Tito&rsquo;s reply states that the GPU sought to
 recruit agents from among Communists and other citizens of Yugoslavia
 for purposes of espionage upon the regime. Tito&rsquo;s break,
 successful as of this writing, indicates that secret police controls
 are exceedingly difficult to maintain against a regime that is itself
 a police slate.</P>
