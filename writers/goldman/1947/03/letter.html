<p class="quoteb">... &#8220;those of the bureaucratic collectivists who argued.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">In the great controversy between Max Shachtman and Ted Grant (see <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/vol13/no02/grant-shachtman.html" target="new"><strong>The New International</strong></a>, Feb. 1947) as to whom the above clause refers to, I want to be recorded as voting for Comrade Grant</p>

<p>It should be clear to everybody that the word &#8220;those&#8221; singles out a group of bureaucratic collectivists and indicates that not all of the proponents of the theory of bureaucratic collectivism have the same arguments. The past tense of the word &#8220;argue&#8221; indicates that the argument occurred in the past.</p>

<p>If Comrade Grant&#8217;s sentence is not clear to some people it should certainly be clear to those who followed closely the 1940 controversy. When I read the sentence I unhesitatingly took it for granted that Grant referred to Trotky&#8217;s comment on Bruno R. It never occurred to me that he referred to Shachtman.</p>

<p>The fact that Bruno R. is a mysterious person is completely immaterial. By the way, his book, if I am not mistaken, can be obtained at the New York Public Library. The fact that &#8220;those&#8221; is plural is also immaterial since Grant has the right to assume that Bruno R. had at least one follower.</p>

<p>There is nothing for Max Shachtman to do except to admit having made a mistake &#8211; in fact two mistakes: one in his original comment and one in the rebuttal.</p>

<p>And please do not permit him to make the same mistake for a third time.</p>
