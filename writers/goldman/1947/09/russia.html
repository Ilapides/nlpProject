<p class="fst">The consequences of the victory of the Stalinist army have been so
devastating to the socialist revolution that one would expect the
entire Fourth International to give up the slogan of defense without
extended discussion. But so great is the power of a formula created
by a master, even when the master himself paid little attention to
formulae, that it becomes next to impossible to tear the blind
followers away from it.</p>

<p>To defend Stalinist Russia means not only to offer an explanation
of what we are defending but also, wherever possible, to help the
Stalinist army gain victory. This course was perhaps justified when
we did not know the actual results that would follow from such a
victory. After these results stare us in the face, to help the
Stalinist army gain victory means, regardless of our intentions, to
share in the responsibility for the crimes of Stalinism, resulting
from that victory. It is, to say the least, criminally reckless, to
wish and work for the victory of ah army which is nothing but the
instrument of a group desiring to increase the number of people under
its oppressive rule.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to elaborate on the consequences of the
Stalinist victory. The most important single factor in preventing the
socialist revolution in eastern Europe was the Russian army. Because
of that victory the strength of the Stalinist parties in western
Europe has been greatly enhanced and the failure of the socialist
revolution to develop in France and other western European countries
can be attributed to the fact that the. workers followed the
Stalinist parties. The victory of the Stalinist army meant the
plundering and looting of eastern Europe and Manchuria; it meant
forced labor and death for millions of German, Polish, Balkan, Baltic
and Japanese workers and peasants.</p>

<p>Expressing their regrets at the consequences of the victory of the
Stalinist army, the official theoreticians of the Fourth
International cling to the formula of Trotsky about nationalized
property and base themselves entirely on that formula. Comrade
Germain writes about the &#8220;brilliant&#8221; results achieved by the
Stalinists in rebuilding the devastated portions of Russia and barely
mentions the millions of slaves who make these&#8221;brilliant&#8221; results
possible. These are people who have not advanced on: step since
Trotsky wrote <strong>The Revolution Betrayed</strong>. They continue with the
pattern created by him and differ only in their figures on production
and consumption.</p>

<p>Perhaps these theoreticians would learn if they had the
opportunity to present the theories and their figures to the
miserable slaves in the. Stalinist concentration camps. Or will It
require the occupation of Belgium and France by Stalin&#8217;s
&#8220;liberating army&#8221; before they get some practical lessons on
Russian economy and production relations? Let us hope they will not
have to go through this bitter experience.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Nationalized Property and Defense</h4>

<p class="fst">Basically we based our defense of Stalinist Russia primarily on
the fact that nationalized property achieved by the proletarian
revolution still existed. We accepted without argument the
proposition that nationalized property is, in and of itself,
progressive as against capitalist property. To a certain extent
therefore our defense of nationalized property was implicitly
based on the proposition that the consequences of that form of
property are necessarily progressive.</p>

<p>Reality showed us that the results of the victory of the army
which defended nationalized property in Russia and the interests of
the bureaucracy were anything but progressive. viewing those results
from the standpoint of the interests of the socialist revolution. The
implicit assumption that the consequences of a &#8220;victory of
nationalized property&#8221; would be progressive was proved false by
events. They are not Marxists who fail to regard the actual course of
events and cling to a theory that has been proved false.</p>

<p>When we consider the events that have occurred since 1939 we
should be able to realize that Trotsky was mistaken when he
formulated the proposition that we must defend Stalinist Russia so
long as nationalized property exists. It is true that in his
discussions and arguments he implied that the defense of nationalized
property would be followed by progressive consequences. But the
formula itself did not include that thought. It is within the spirit
and method of Trotsky and all other great Marxists who insisted on
analyzing events and not clinging to a theory that we must now
proceed to correct the error made by Trotsky and accepted by us.</p>

<p>Our defense of the Soviet Union should not have been based solely
on the fact that nationalized property was still in existence but
also on all of the conditions under which nationalized property was
functioning. When we defended the Soviet Union in the days when Lenin
and Trotsky were guiding its destinies we did not do so because
property was nationalized. (For a short period it was not
nationalized.) It is far more correct to say that we defended the
Soviet Union at that time because the program and policies of the
Bolshevik party were leading the country in a socialist direction.</p>

<p>With the defeat of the Left Opposition representing the program of
October it became necessary at every stage to indicate the factors,
in addition to the existence of nationalized property, which made it
obligatory for us to defend the Soviet Union. The existence of the
traditions of October in the consciousness of the masses and the
possibility, therefore, of their taking advantage of a war to
overthrow the Stalinist bureaucracy was an important factor in favor
of defense. So also was the expectation that a victory of the Russian
army would set the European Revolution into action.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that to regard the existence of nationalized
property as the basic and sole criterion for defense simplifies the
problem enormously. It is a criterion that is more objective than any
other and is more easily measurable. Introducing other factors such
as the existence of workers&#8217; control and the traditions of October
in the consciousness of the masses complicates the problem of
defending or not defending Russia. But simplifying the problem does
not make for a correct solution.</p>

<p>Had Trotsky emphasized that nationalized property functions under
certain conditions and that some of these conditions must be taken
into consideration in determining our attitude on defense he would
have been far more correct.</p>

<p>Let justice be done though the heavens fall. This is the rule
followed by those who cling to the formula: Because there is still
nationalized property Russia must be defended, regardless of the
consequences. The rule of the Stalinist bureaucracy has of course
nothing to do with justice.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Possible Theories for Defense</h4>

<p class="fst">What theory can possibly justify defense of a state when the
victory of its army leads to such dire consequences to the masses of
the defeated countries? If the victory of an army leads to robbery
and pillage, to the execution of the best representatives of the
socialist movement, to the forced labor of millions of people, what
possible theory is there to justify wishing and working for such a victory?</p>

<p>One can claim that the consequences resulting from the victory of
the Stalinist army are temporary in nature; that somehow or other
nationalized property under Stalinism will ultimately increase the
productivity of labor and due to that the masses will gain democracy
and thus place Russia and the Russian satellite states in the path of socialism.</p>

<p>That Trotsky never had that theory goes without saying. He stated
definitely that without the European Revolution Russia will return to
capitalism. The correctness of that theory may be questioned but what
cannot be questioned is that Trotsky never had a theory claiming that
Russia would return to the path of socialism by virtue of the
existence of nationalized property. (I am given to understand that
lately some French comrades have accepted some such theory. If that
is true they will in all probability capitulate to Stalinism completely.)</p>

<p>We based ourselves on the theory that only a socialist revolution
in Europe would give the Russian masses a chance for victory against
the Stalinist bureaucracy. Now it has been shown to those who have
eyes to see that a victory of the Stalinist army prevents a socialist
revolution in Europe. <em>A successful revolution must be predicated
upon the defeat of the Stalinist army.</em></p>

<p>That the bureaucracy constitutes a burden upon the development of
the productive forces in Russia has been one of our chief tenets.
Strictly speaking there may not be sufficient evidence to conclude
that nationalized property under Stalinism cannot exceed the
productivity of labor reached by capitalism. All indications,
however, point to the truth of that conclusion. Certainly we are
justified in making the <em>a priori</em> statement that slave and
semi-slave labor cannot, in the long-run, be the basis of an increase
in the productivity of labor.</p>

<p>Another theory justifying defense is that the victory of a
capitalist army would lead to even worse consequences. It is indeed
difficult to envision worse consequences than those resulting from
the victory of the Stalinist army. Even the Jews had little to choose
between a victory of the Stalinist or of the Nazi armies. It is true
that the Jews do not generally suffer under the Stalinist regime
because they are Jews, but it is very little consolation to be given
the choice between death in the gas chamber and &#8220;life&#8221; in the
Siberian concentration camps together with non-Jews.</p>

<p>Certainly as between a victory for the Russian armies and one for
the democratic capitalist armies the choice, for the immediate
future, is all in favor of the latter. To those who present us with
the argument that a victory of the Nazis would have destroyed
completely the possibilities of the socialist revolution for
generations (and this is absolutely true) the answer is that it is
not the victory of the Stalinists that gave the European workers a
breathing spell but the victory of the British and American
imperialists. (It is not, I hope, necessary to state that this does
not mean that we should have supported the democratic imperialists.)
One must indeed be blind not to recognize that whatever independent
working class movement there exists at present in western Europe is
due largely to the victory of the democratic imperialists over Hitler.</p>

<p>Great emphasis has been and is being laid by those who follow the
old line of defense, on the argument that the victory of the
Stalinist army prevents the expansion of capitalist imperialism into
the territory now controlled by Stalinism. This argument was based on
the proposition that somehow or other nationalized property under any
conditions is to be preferred over capitalism under the most
democratic conditions. This argument had validity on the supposition
that the victory of the army defending nationalized property would
lead to progressive consequences from the point of view of advancing
the interests of the socialist revolution.</p>

<p>The consequences of the victory of Stalinism blasted that argument
to pieces and one must now change the theory to conform to the facts.
And the facts show that there are greater possibilities for the
socialist revolution in a democratic capitalist state than under a
Stalinist totalitarian regime. So long as democratic capitalism
lasts, so long have the workers some chance to organize and struggle
for the socialist revolution.</p>

<p>It is highly improbable that in case of a victory of democratic
capitalism over the Stalinist armies, capitalist property rebtions
would be re-established. But if they were and the Russian masses
would once more get a breathing spell the net result would be a gain
and not a loss for them. In the light of the probability of a war
between Russia and the United States and of the possibility of a
victory for the former the question must be posed: would the masses
under Stalinism be better off than they are under democratic
capitalism. Only those who see some mystical power in nationalized
property, which must ultimately lead to socialism regardless of
the totalitarian regime, can answer that question in the affirmative.
For those who do not believe in religion the answer must be that
there is as much chance for socialism emanating from the Stalinist
regimes as from a fascist regime.</p>

<p>Lenin, quoting Goethe, remarked that theories are gray but green
is the living reality. To cling to theories which are contrary to the
facts of life is not in line with Marxist tradition.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Nature of Russian Economy and State</h4>

<p class="fst">What is this monstrosity which is the result of the degeneration
of what was once a workers&#8217; state?</p>

<p>The development of a social order, totally different from anything
we expected has necessarily given rise to sharp differences of
opinion as to its nature. People who base themselves on the same
general principles of Marx disagree in defining the nature of a
social order which has the characteristics. of everything bad that
has ever afflicted mankind.</p>

<p>We are somewhat in the position of scientists confronted with the
birth of a strange and unexpected specimen. Some conclude that it is
a totally new species and proceed to give it a new name; some insist
that it is very similar to something with which we are familiar and
insist that we have at least the name of the familiar species as part
of the name for the new arrival; the more cautious ones say that it
is necessary to wait and see what developments will take place in the
monster, before coming to a definite decision. Meanwhile let us call
it a degeneration of the species from which it sprang.</p>

<p>For those who have given up the idea of defending Russia the
question of what it is and what to call it is not of very great
importance. No matter what one calls it, it is bad for the human
race. An explanation of its origin is important and most of us,
regardless of the differences we have on the nature of the Russian
state, accept Trotsky&#8217;s explanation for its origin. We look at the
monstrosity and in the main agree that it has certain aspects and
functions in a certain way. Above all, we agree that the bureaucracy
or class in power should be overthrown and the political and economic
life of the country be placed under the control of the workers.
Nevertheless the theory that we accept as to the nature of the
Russian state has some importance, as I shall try to show.</p>

<p>It must first of all be recognized that only two theories of its
nature settle the question of whether or not to defend Russia without
any further examination. The Stalinists have no problem of defense
because they consider Russia a workers&#8217; state. Those who consider
that capitalism as described by Marx prevails in Russia, except that
the state has replaced the capitalists, also have no problem of defense.</p>

<p>But if one accepts the theory that Russia is a bureaucratic
collectivist society or that it is a new social order that should be
designated as &#8220;state capitalism,&#8221; or that it is a degenerated
workers&#8217; state the question of defense is not automatically solved.
What should determine our decision as to whether or not to defend it
is not the label or the theory but whether or not we consider the
economy and the conditions under which it functions as progressive.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Bureaucratic Collectivism</h4>

<p class="fst">The fundamental proposition of the theory of bureaucratic
collectivism is that the Russian bureaucracy, constituting a new
class, owns the industries of that country, exploits the masses of
Russia and has launched upon an imperialist course to dominate and
exploit the masses of other countries.</p>

<p>The minority of 1940 in the Socialist Workers Party (the main
advocates at present of the bureaucratic collectivist theory) had
what then appeared to be an absolutely incorrect position, but which,
in the light of events, has proven to be the correct approach. The
comrades of that minority held that regardless of the fact that one
considered Russia a degenerated workers&#8217; state it should not be
defended. This position was not elaborated and made clear but
essentially, as a method of approach, it was more correct than the
method of the majority which held to the theory that so long as
Russia was a degenerated workers&#8217; state it must be defended.</p>

<p>It seems plausible to conclude that not the least important factor
which led the comrades of the minority of 1940 to adopt the theory
and label first suggested by the Italian Comrade Bruno R. was the
sharp criticism of Trotsky to the effect that they failed to take
into consideration the nature of the Soviet Union in arriving at
their position against defense.</p>

<p>As stated above, to consider Russia as a bureaucratic collectivist
state does not thereby solve the problem as to whether it should be
defended. As a matter of fact the theory of bureaucratic
collectivism, just as the theory of the degenerated workers&#8217; state,
speaks for defense rather than against it. For if Russian society is
some form of collectivism it should be defended as against
capitalism. It can be readily seen that the question of defense
cannot be settled by calling Russia a bureaucratic collectivist state
but by an analysis of its economy, the conditions under which the
economy functions and the consequences that would probably follow
from a victory of its army.</p>

<p>A minor objection to the term &#8220;bureaucratic collectivism&#8221; &#8211;
an outlandish term at best &#8211; is that it distorts somewhat the
picture of the actual situation in Russia. Actually the state
property is not owned by all of the bureaucrats collectively; it is
owned by the state and the state is &#8220;owned&#8221; not by all of the
bureaucrats but by those on the very highest rung of the ladder of bureaucracy.</p>

<p>One must also remember that the term &#8220;collectivism&#8221; was used
in the socialist movement as a synonym for socialism. If one were to
propose to label that which exists in Russia &#8220;bureaucratic
socialism&#8221; many would object on the following grounds: (1) there is
no socialism whatever in Russia; (2) the phrase is a contradiction in
terms, for if there is socialism it cannot be bureaucratic, and (3)
why defile the term &#8220;socialism&#8221;? The very same objections are
applicable to the term &#8220;bureaucratic collectivism.&#8221;</p>

<p>The most serious objection to the theory of bureaucratic
collectivism is that it tends to raise theoretical difficulties in
the path of the struggle for socialism. Thus far we have based
ourselves on the theory of Marx that the class struggle under
capitalism will result in the victory of the working class and the
establishment of socialism. Bureaucratic collectivism revises that
theory and indicates that a system other than socialism, that is,
bureaucratic collectivism, is just as likely to follow capitalism. At
first it seemed as if the proponents of the bureaucratic collectivist
theory confined the new social order to Russia but with the spread of
Russian domination in eastern Europe it appears as if bureaucratic
collectivism is a serious rival to socialism as the system of society
that will replace capitalism the world over.</p>

<p>This implication in the theory of bureaucratic collectivism is
strengthened by the fact that those who hold that theory contend that
the bureaucracy in Russia is a class. If it is, then, for those who
accept the Marxist concept of a class, it should have a progressive
task in the development of the productive forces and should be
expected to retain its rule for a comparatively long period.</p>

<p>And what would follow the social order of bureaucratic
collectivism? It is indeed difficult to imagine socialism emerging
from the womb of bureaucratic collectivism. The very reason for the
existence of this new social order the world over would be the
inability of the working class to take and retain power. If it cannot
do so under capitalism which permits a certain degree of freedom for
the education and organization of the proletariat how can it reach a
high level of education and organization under a system which
practically enslaves the masses?</p>

<p>One can visualize great conflicts resulting from the national and
social oppression of the masses in a totalitarian society but it is
highly improbable that an educated socialist proletariat should
develop in a police state. And such a proletariat is essential for
the establishment of a socialist society. The perspective which the
theory of bureaucratic collectivism gives us is a bleak one indeed.</p>

<p>To revise Marx when events demand it is not only justified but
absolutely essential. Otherwise one is not a Marxist. The comrades
who insist that the theory of bureaucratic collectivism best explains
the conditions in Russia can surely claim that they are applying the
method of Marx, although rejecting a basic conclusion of the founder
of socialism. Comrade Shachtman has adequately answered the
theoreticians of the Socialist Workers Party on that score. (See Max
Shachtman&#8217;s <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/shachtma/1947/04/russianstate.html" target="new">article</a> in <strong>The New International</strong> of April 1947.)</p>

<p>It is not because the theory of bureaucratic collectivism revises
a basic conclusion of Marx that it should be rejected; it is because,
by its revision, it raises possible theoretical difficulties in the
struggle for socialism that it should be rejected.</p>

<p>It may be argued that the theoretical difficulties are not the
fault of the theory but of reality. But if another theory explains
the facts just as well and does not raise the theoretical
difficulties that are implied in the theory of bureaucratic
collectivism, then such a theory is to be preferred. We can look at
the Stalinist bureaucracy and agree that what it does and how it acts
make of it the greatest enemy ,to socialism. We can call it by any
name we please and it will still act in the same manner. But if
calling it a &#8220;class&#8221; raises theoretical difficulties in the
struggle for socialism and calling it a bureaucracy avoids those
difficulties that is a good reason for calling it a bureaucracy. The
theory of socialism has for its purpose to achieve freedom for
mankind and unless there are compelling facts to revise it we should
reject every theory that revises it to the detriment of the struggle
for socialism.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>State Capitalism</h4>

<p class="fst">Most of those who accept the theory that state capitalism prevails
in Russia do so on the alleged ground that the economic system in
that country is essentially the same as in the United States or
England. According to them in Russia private capitalism has been
displaced by state capitalism &#8211; but all the laws of capitalism as
analyzed and explained by Marx continue to operate.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that sections of the Marxist theory of the
functioning of capitalism can be made to apply to the Russian system
of exploitation. But we must view the theory of Marx as a whole and
we must view the Russian economic system as a whole. If we do that it
becomes clear that the Russian system of economy differs radically
from the system of capitalism analyzed by Marx. The Russian system is
in effect a new system of economy.</p>

<p>Many who claim that there is state capitalism in Russia and insist
that it essentially follows the same laws that operate in the
&#8220;classical&#8221; capitalist system use somewhat the following logic:
In Russia the law of value functions; there is accumulation of
wealth; misery prevails for the masses and a high standard of living
for the few, etc. The same conditions exist under capitalism.
Therefore Russia is capitalist.</p>

<p>In general it can be said that all of the aspects of Russian
economy which the theoreticians of state capitalism point to as
evidence existed in modified form in the early days of the Soviet
Union. The fact is that the ultra-lefts have used the same arguments
to prove that state capitalism existed under Lenin and Trotsky.</p>

<p>Stalin did not introduce the law of value into Russian economy; it
certainly operated in Soviet economy during the days of the New
Economic Policy. One of the reasons for the retreat of the leaders of
Bolshevism from war communism to the New Economic Policy was
precisely because they saw that they were wrong in their attempt to
do away with the law of value. During the period of transition
between capitalism and complete socialism the law of value will
operate to a certain extent even under the best of circumstances.</p>

<p>The difference between a Stalinist regime determined to defend the
interests of the bureaucracy and a Lenin-Trotsky regime striving to
achieve socialism lies partly in this: whereas under Lenin and
Trotsky there was an interference with the law of value for the
benefit of the workers, the Stalinists interfere with it to the
injury of the workers and in favor of the bureaucracy. It is most
probable that if the bureaucracy permitted the law of value to
operate freely the workers would benefit thereby.</p>

<p>To designate the economy of Russia as state capitalist on the
basis that it is practically the same as the capitalist economies
analyzed by Marx is to fly in the face of the facts and that is one
thing Marxists must never do. The ownership by the state of the means
of production and the abolition of competition on the free market
means the abolition of capitalism.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>State Capitalism &#8211; A New Order</h4>

<p class="fst">It may be possible, however, to contend that the Russian economy
represents a new social order for which the best name is &#8220;state
capitalism.&#8221; Those who hold this theory do not attempt to prove
that state capitalism exists in Russia by pointing to some laws of
Marxian economics which prevail also in Russia. They face the fact
that Russian economy is totally different from American or English
economy and simply assert that state capitalism is the best label for
the Russian economic system.</p>

<p>Between the proponents of this theory of state capitalism and the
advocates of the theory of bureaucratic collectivism there is a
difference only in label. They both agree that a new class rules in
Russia and a new social order &#8211; neither socialism nor capitalism &#8211;
exists in that country. There can be only a terminological conflict
between these two theories with the advantages all in favor of the
label &#8220;state capitalism.&#8221;</p>

<p>That the industries are owned by the state and that the state is
&#8220;owned&#8221; by the top layer of the bureaucracy are facts which speak
persuasively in favor of calling the Russian system state capitalism.
Also at present there is some indication that in Russia there is
developing a group living off the interest obtained by virtue of the
ownership of bonds. The members of this group can now pass their
wealth on to their heirs. A state which owns the industries and which
has as its primary purpose the exploitation of the masses for the
benefit of those who &#8220;own&#8221; the state and of bondholders can very
well be designated as a capitalist state and the system which it
defends as &#8220;state capitalism.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trotsky&#8217;s objection to the term &#8220;state capitalism&#8221; was that
it was used in a different sense in the Marxist movement. It referred
to the ownership of certain industries by the capitalist state under
the prevailing regime of private property. That is not a serious
objection; the reply can be made that what is necessary now is to
find the best possible term to designate a new phenomenon. It is true
that we must invest the term &#8220;state capitalism&#8221; with a new
meaning in order to apply it to the Russian system of economy but
that should not constitute an insurmountable obstacle.</p>

<p>While I am opposed to the concept that state capitalism prevails
in Russia on the same general grounds that I oppose the theory of
bureaucratic collectivism, I am all in favor of using the term &#8220;state
capitalism&#8221; as against &#8220;bureaucratic collectivism.&#8221; Should we
be compelled by the course of events to revise Marx and recognize
that a social system which is not socialism is destined to follow
capitalism, then we should call it state capitalism rather than
bureaucratic collectivism. I strongly urge those who believe in the
theory that there is a new class which rules a new social order in
Russia to drop the term &#8220;bureaucratic collectivism&#8221; in favor of
the term &#8220;state capitalism.&#8221; From the propaganda point of view it
is the best tenn available because it is familiar to the advanced
workers and to some extent it creates a connection between the
struggle against the capitalist state as it exists in capitalist
countries and the struggle against the Russian state.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Degenerated Workers&#8217; State</h4>

<p class="fst">I hold that for the present the theory which best describes the
economic and social conditions prevailing in Russia is still
&#8220;degenerated workers&#8217; state.&#8221; There is one very serious
objection to the term and that is that the word &#8220;workers&#8221; can be
easily misunderstood and misinterpreted. It seems to be almost
impossible to use the term without having the objection raised that
the workers have no control whatever in Russia and that they are
oppressed and enslaved &#8211; all of which is perfectly true &#8211; and
that therefore it cannot possibly be even a degenerated workers&#8217;
state. From the propaganda point of view the term &#8220;state
capitalist&#8221; is much better than the term &#8220;degenerated workers&#8217;
state.&#8221; But the theory that Russia is a degenerated workers&#8217;
state avoids the theoretical difficulties of the theories of
bureaucratic collectivism and of state capitalism. These theoretical
difficulties are far more serious than the propaganda difficulties
connected with the use of the term &#8220;degenerated workers&#8217; state.&#8221;</p>

<p>When used at present the term &#8220;degenerated workers&#8217; state&#8221;
should mean only that Russia was once a workers&#8217; state and has by
this time degenerated to a point where it has nothing whatever to do
with socialism and should under no circumstances be defended. The
term &#8220;degenerated,&#8221; because of its vagueness, always demanded an
explanation. Stalinist Russia was degenerated when Trotsky advocated
a peaceful elimination of the bureaucracy; it was degenerated when he
changed his mind and said that a violent overthrow of the ruling
clique was necessary.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1936/revbet/index.htm" target="new"><strong>The Revolution Betrayed</strong></a>, Trotsky contended that the nationalization of the land, the means of industrial production,
together with the monopoly of foreign trade make of the Soviet Union
a proletarian state. This general principle must be revised. We must
say that what made the Soviet Union a workers&#8217; state was not only
the property relations but the program and policies which directed
the state in the path of achieving socialism. With the victory of the
Stalinist bureaucracy there was a turn away from the socialist path
and now the road leads in the opposite direction from that of socialism.</p>

<p>Where will it lead to? Almost up to the last months of his life
Trotsky held to his theory that it can lead either to a restoration
of capitalism or to the overthrow of the Stalinist bureaucracy and a
march back to socialism. In his last articles in 1939&#8211;40, during
the factional fight with the minority of the SWP, he presented the
possibility of a third alternative, the alternative of a degenerated
society such as exists in Russia under Stalinism, if the workers do
not take power. Trotsky went to the extent of saying that the workers
must take power during or immediately after the war in order to
prevent this &#8220;declining society of the totalitarian epoch&#8221; from
replacing capitalist society. I think we can say that in this
instance Trotsky was too pessimistic.</p>

<p>More than two years after the war we can still say that history
has not yet made a definitive decision. There are still great
possibilities for the victory of socialism, especially in the most
powerful country in the world, the United States. As fighters for the
freedom of mankind through socialism we have no right to give up the
struggle until the decision comes in this country. It is unnecessary
of course to drown out one&#8217;s doubts by shouting about the &#8220;coming
American Revolution,&#8221; as if it is around the corner (leaving a way
out of course by saying that the &#8220;coming revolution&#8221; does not
mean that it will come tomorrow). We can say truthfully that we do
not know when the decision will come but that we must do our utmost
to assure victory for socialism.</p>

<p>Victory for socialism in this country means the certain defeat of
Stalinism and fascism the world over. Defeat for socialism in this
country means the ushering in of the &#8220;declining society of the
totalitarian epoch&#8221; which may last for decades or centuries. And,
as Trotsky indicated, such a development will mean the necessity of a
thorough revision of Marxism.</p>

<p>The superiority of the concept of &#8220;degenerated workers&#8217; state&#8221;
over all other theories lies in the fact that it recognizes that
history has not yet said the last word and that whether or not a new
order other than socialism will replace capitalism will be decided by
the struggle that is still going on in Europe and especially by the
struggle in the United States.</p>

<p>What class rules in Russia? This is the insurmountable obstacle
for those who look upon Marxism as a series of quotations. Surely the
workers do not rule; they are semi-slaves at best. Surely the
capitalists as we know them in this country do not rule; they have
been eliminated in Russia and are being eliminated everywhere that
Russia gains control. The bureaucrats rule and the direction is
toward their development as a new class. If doctrinaires reject such
a concept because according to Marx either the capitalists or the
workers must rule, then our only answer is that they do not
understand the real method of Marx who insisted upon looking at
phenomena in process of development.</p>

<p>Weighing the merits and demerits of the various theories advanced
as to the nature of Stalinist Russia I conclude that, for the present
at least, we should retain the theory of degenerated workers&#8217; state
because it explains the existing facts as well as any other theory
and it does not raise any theoretical barrier to the continuation of
the struggle for socialism.</p>
