<p class="fst">What has become known as the &ldquo;Act of Chapultepec&rdquo; is
considered the major achievement of the Inter-American Conference
held recently in Mexico City. The masses of the Latin American
countries can with justification feel disquieted about this
achievement. Through it the door has been opened for the apparently
&ldquo;legal&rdquo; intervention by American imperialism in the
affairs of Latin American countries.</p>

<p>For the representatives of twenty American republics meeting in
Mexico City to deal &ldquo;with problems of war and peace&rdquo;
accepted a proposition which obligates these governments to guarantee
the territorial integrity and the political independence of every
country signing the Act of Chapultepec. In case of a threat to any of
the nations that sent representatives to the conference, either by an
American or non-American aggressor, all the others promise to
consult, to agree on measures to be taken against the aggressor, and
to use force if necessary to prevent or repel aggression.</p>

<p>For the duration of the war any intervention under the Act of
Chapultepec is to take place only if the aggression interferes with
the &ldquo;war effort.&rdquo; After the war a treaty is to be drafted
to be presented to the United States Senate for ratification
providing for the same guarantees but without the necessity of
justifying any intervention because of interference with the war
effort. This distinction was made to avoid any conflict between the
Roosevelt administration and the Senate.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>By signing the declaration the Latin American republics have
given up a tradition in existence for many decades &ndash; the
tradition of opposition to any interference by the United States in
their internal or external affairs. In 1933 at the conference held in
Lima these republics insisted on a statement that &ldquo;the
intervention of any state in the internal or external affairs of
another is inadmissible.&rdquo; This statement was aimed at American
imperialism. Roosevelt agreed to it because he had decided to
introduce the &ldquo;good neighbor policy&rdquo; and to use the silk
glove instead of the mailed fist in order to guard the supremacy of
American imperialism in the Western Hemisphere.</em></p>

<p>When one takes into consideration the fact that the only power
that is really capable of using force to prevent &ldquo;aggression&rdquo;
against any Latin American republic is the United States, it becomes
clear that the representatives of the Latin American republics have
permitted a loophole which the imperialists of this country may
utilize as a legal cover for any future intervention.</p>

<p>It may be true, as is claimed, that fear of a possible attack by
Argentina against its weak neighbors is the factor that led some of
the Latin American representatives to introduce the proposal embodied
in the Act of Chapultepec. But to depend upon U.S. imperialism to
defend the territorial integrity and political independence of any
Latin American country is a sign of imbecility or a conscious
betrayal of the masses of the Latin American countries. One might as
well depend upon the tiger for defense against the wolf.</p>

<p>At present it is the military-police dictatorship of Argentina
that has aroused the displeasure of the United States Government. All
other Latin American republics have willingly exchanged their
independence of action for economic help from the rich uncle. It
happens that Argentina is not so dependent upon help from this
country. It is in fact a competitor of the United States on the world
market for meat and grain products. Behind Argentina are the British
imperialists who are deriving great satisfaction from the
Argentina-United States controversy.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Will Scrap Treaties</h4>

<p class="fst">But it will not always be a reactionary government that will
oppose the dictates of the American imperialists. On the contrary,
the more democratic and progressive a government of any Latin
American country is, the more likely is it to come in conflict with
the colossus of the north.</p>

<p><em>It must be recognized of course that the imperialists of this
country will not, in the last analysis, be guided by provisions in
any agreement or treaty. If and when they think that intervention on
their part is necessary to protect their interests, they will do so
with or without any provisions in any treaty. But under no
circumstances should U.S. imperialism be furnished with a &ldquo;legal&rdquo;
pretext by the very countries who ought to oppose intervention under
any circumstances. The masses of Latin America must defend themselves
against the dictatorships of Argentina and other South American
countries but they must never rely on the American imperialists.</em></p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">If the Act of Chapultepec received the lion&rsquo;s share of
attention at the conference, the economic problems facing the Latin
American countries gave the representatives of those countries the
greatest worry. What will the capitalists of the United States and
their government do to help the Latin American countries economically
after the war? For the present the Latin American governments depend
for their economic stability upon the contracts for the sale of raw
material to the United States. Should the United States cease its
purchases it would result in economic breakdown and possible
revolutionary upheavals.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Socialist Latin America</h4>

<p class="fst">What the Latin American representatives received from the
representatives of the United States were some declarations on the
necessity of a higher standard of living and of encouragement for
private investments. The Latin American politicians were not greatly
interested in empty declarations. The best they could get, however,
was a promise that the contracts for the purchase of raw material
would be canceled only after due notice.</p>

<p><em>Undoubtedly United States imperialism will try to keep the
Latin American governments satisfied. But the fundamental
contradiction between American imperialism anxious to make profits
out of its investments in Latin America and the welfare of the Latin
American masses cannot possibly be solved. The industrialization of
Latin America, the raising of the standard of living for the masses,
the complete independence of the Latin American republics are
problems that cannot be solved with the aid of American imperialism.
They can be solved only by a Socialist Latin America with the aid of
a Socialist United States.</em></p>
