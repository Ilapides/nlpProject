<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1945/index.htm#m45_09" target="new">Vol. IX No. 9</a>, 3 March 1945, p.&nbsp;3.<br />

<p class="fst">For the workers of Europe, including England and the Soviet Union,
the problem of reparations, discussed by Stalin, Roosevelt, and
Churchill at the Crimea conference becomes one of the most important
problems that Will confront them in the post-war period. Because that
problem is intimately connected with the all-important questions: how
should the working masses go about repairing the vast damage wrought
by the various armies; for whose benefit shall they repair it; how
should they guarantee that once repaired, another and more
destructive war will not once again bring ruin and chaos to Europe?</p>

<p>The representative of the Kremlin bureaucracy and the exponents of
British and American imperialism were exceedingly vague on this
question of reparations in their release issued after the conference
at Yalta. They &ldquo;recognized it, as just that Germany be obliged
to make compensation for this damage in kind to the greatest extent
possible&rdquo; and provided for a commission &ldquo;to consider the
question of the extent and methods for compensating damage caused by
Germany to the Allied countries.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>There were undoubtedly differences of opinion between Stalin on
the one hand and Churchill and Roosevelt on the other, on the
question of compelling German workers to work under the whip of
Stalin and the Allied imperialists for the restoration of the
devastated areas. The capitalist countries are faced with the problem
of what to do with their own workers and also with serious opposition
on the part of the organized workers to the use of slave labor, a
system which would inevitably reduce the standard of living of the
native workers. Stalin is not confronted with these difficulties and
is anxious to enslave the skilled German workers for the purpose of
restoring the devastated areas of the Soviet Union.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>How to Rebuild</h4>

<p class="fst">Leaving aside the differences with reference to the method of
reparations, it is clear that Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt agreed
on the principle of reparations. Here a warning to some advanced
workers is necessary. So terrible is the ruin caused by Hitler&rsquo;s
armies that it is fairly easy for Stalin and the imperialist
representatives to convince the millions of people who suffered at
the hands of Hitler that justice demands reparations by the Germans.
Some radical workers, understanding correctly that the Soviet
bureaucrats and the imperialists will utilize the apparent justice of
the claim to reparations in order to fool the masses, may insist on
presenting the obvious argument that the armies of Stalin, Churchill
and Roosevelt caused as much, if not more damage, at least in Western
Europe, as Hitler&rsquo;s armies.</p>

<p>The question must not be argued on that plane. Not only is it
impossible to say which army did the most damage but an argument of
that type indirectly involves us in the futile argument as to which
side was responsible for the war. Taking the fundamental position
that the imperialist rivalries are responsible, we can and must shift
the argument to the question as to what is the best method for the
workers to use to rebuild the devastated areas and how to prevent
their destruction by another war.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">On the theory that Germany alone is responsible for the war,
Stalin, the imperialists and their representatives and followers
argue: make Germany pay for the damage in services, in goods and in
money; take control over the entire German economy for many years and
generations if necessary; close down and destroy all her war
industries (which means in practice her basic industries). These in
essence are the proposals made by Sir Walter Citrine, general
secretary of the British Trades Union Congress, at the World Trade
Union Conference recently held in London. His views are of course the
views of the British Government, and in general they represent the
views of all the governments on the side of the Allies.</p>

<p><em>Against these views the advanced workers of Europe, especially
those of England and France, must conduct the most bitter and
incessant struggle. They must stress that for the welfare of all the
workers of Europe German economy must not be weakened; on the
contrary it must be strengthened if that is possible. The fate of
civilized Europe depends largely on German productive forces. Any
plan which starts from the proposition that German economy must be
weakened is, in reality, directed against the welfare of the European
masses.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Socialist Germany</h4>

<p class="fst">It is obvious however that to leave the German productive machine
in the hands of the German capitalists is to lay the basis for a war
twenty or so years from now. The conclusion is inescapable. To permit
German productive capacity to remain at its high level and even to
increase it so that the masses of all of Europe can benefit, and at
the same time avoid another war, it is necessary to establish a
Socialist Germany. It is necessary for the German workers to take
power and nationalize German industry.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">The German workers can and must utilize the enormous power of
German industry to rebuild the factories that have been destroyed,
the homes that have been bombed out of existence&mdash;not only in
Germany but in all of Europe. The German workers will be more than
glad to help in the rebuilding of Europe provided they know that they
are doing so not for foreign or native exploiters but for themselves
and their fellow-workers of Europe.</p>

<p>Once the European workers realize that the problem of rebuilding
devastated Europe and guaranteeing it against further devastation can
be solved only with the help of a Socialist Germany, their task
becomes dear. No one in his right senses will contend that the Soviet
bureaucracy and the imperialists of Great Britain and the United
States will put the German workers in power for the purpose of
building socialism. The German workers are certain to take power if
the workers of Europe will give them the lead and assure them of
their support.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Aid German Workers</h4>

<p class="fst">Under the condition of complete occupation of Germany by the
Allied armies the burden of removing those armies from Germany and
permitting the German workers to take power will rest upon the
European masses outside of Germany and also upon the American masses.</p>

<p>Essentially the problem of enlisting the aid of German industry in
the rebuilding of devastated Europe can be solved only if the workers
of Europe, especially France and England, take power into their own
hands and call upon the German workers to do the same thing.</p>

<p><em>To leave Europe in the hands of the capitalists and of Stalin
means destroying German industrial power and with that the
possibility of reconstructing Europe for the benefit of the European
masses. Europe can be rebuilt with the help of German industry but
that industry must be in the hands of the German workers. To enable
the German workers to take and hold that industry it is necessary for
the European masses to take power into their own hands. The question
of reparations, when properly analyzed, means that its solution lies
in a Socialist United States of Europe.</em></p>
