<p class="info">From <strong>The Militant</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/themilitant/1945/index.htm#m45_12" target="new">Vol. IX No. 12</a>, 24 March 1945, p.&nbsp;3.<br />

<p class="fst">Many people write and speak as if they were taken by surprise by
the decision of the Big Three, at the Yalta conference, with
reference to Poland. For many months previous to the Yalta verdict
all indications were that Churchill and Roosevelt had decided to
yield to Stalin. The three lords sitting in state at the seaside
resort situated on the shores of the Black Sea found no difficulty in
granting that part of the earth known as Poland to one of them. The
people of Poland were transferred to a new master.</p>

<p>Nominally Stalin was made a gift only of that part of Poland east
of the Curzon line. In reality, however, he also gets all of Poland
west of that line plus whatever German territory the three rulers
will decide later to attach to Poland. Only naive people or those who
have an axe to grind will accept as good coin the promise that &ldquo;free
and unfettered elections&rdquo; will be held in that part of Poland
which, according to Stalin&rsquo;s assurance, will be permitted to
exist in freedom and independence.</p>

<p><em>The Provisional Government created by Stalin will be enlarged
to include &ldquo;democratic leaders&rdquo; from within Poland and
from abroad but it can be taken for granted that only leaders willing
to play ball with Stalin will be acceptable to him. At any rate a
majority of the contemplated Provisional Government of National Unity
will be under Kremlin control and with such a government in power
only the fatuous will expect a free election.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&ldquo;The Great Liquidator&rdquo;</h4>

<p class="fst">Charges have been made by the Polish Government-in-Exile that
Stalin&rsquo;s GPU with the help of his Polish puppets are
liquidating all political opponents of the Stalinist regime, Through
deportations, transfer of populations, and confinement in
concentration camps, Stalin is making certain that any elections held
will give his puppets a safe majority. We need not have too much
confidence in the veracity of the Polish Government-in-Exile to
believe that Stalin will not hesitate to use all measures of
chicanery and violence to rid himself of political opponents,
especially of revolutionary Marxists. His activities in the last
twenty years testify to the truth of such a charge.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">Several factors explain the important concessions made to Stalin
by the representatives of the imperialist democracies. It may be
argued that there was nothing else that they could do. They surely
would not go to war against the Soviet Union for the purpose of
retaining the prewar Polish frontiers. The English and American
masses could not easily be cajoled into supporting such a war. The
issue is too remote; they have already suffered too much. Stalin&rsquo;s
prestige as a result of the victories of the Red Army is too great.
And it is difficult to sell the masses the idea that the Polish
Government-in-Exile represents justice, truth, freedom and democracy.</p>

<p>All this is true but it does not explain why Churchill and
Roosevelt have given in so easily and in addition g0 out of their way
to defend their action as just. The important factor is the
conviction on the part of the representatives of imperialism that
Stalin&rsquo;s help is essential to suppress any revolutionary
outbreaks on the part of the masses in the different countries of
Europe. The Stalinist parties constitute a very important part of the
working- class movement all over Europe. Their role as a brake upon
the revolutionary activity of the masses is clearly understood by the
imperialists.</p>

<p><em>One can say that in Greece the Stalinists led the EAM in its
struggle against Papandreou and the British masters. Rut just because
of that fact and just because the Stalinists betrayed that struggle,
Churchill and Roosevelt know what a valuable support they can be for
keeping the rule of the imperialists in Europe safe from the masses.</em></p>

<p>And not only do the imperialists depend upon Stalin&rsquo;s
control of the Communist parties but upon Stalin&rsquo;s Red Army
which in case of necessity can be used to crush any revolutionary
uprising by force. Rumor has it that Stalin has made some secret
promises to Churchill and Roosevelt. One of those promises is
undoubtedly to help keep the European masses chained to capitalism.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Capitalist Restoration</h4>

<p class="fst">Another exceedingly important factor explaining Roosevelt&rsquo;s
and Churchill&rsquo;s decision to appease Stalin is their conviction
that capitalism stands a very good chance of being restored in the
Soviet Union. They know better than we do the extent of the
devastation brought to the Soviet Union by Hitler&rsquo;s armies. Has
Stalin indicated to them that he needs their economic aid and that he
does not look with hostility to a strengthening of the capitalist
forces within the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>No one can tell whether Stalin discussed this question with the
other two participants in the Yalta Conference. But we can safely
assume that Churchill and Roosevelt realize that conditions exert a
tremendous pressure upon the Stalinist bureaucracy in favor of the
restoration of the capitalist market. In the light of the tendencies
of capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union, the representatives of
imperialism are more than willing to take a chance on yielding to
Stalin on the Polish question.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<h4>For a Soviet Poland</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>The advanced workers of Poland will certainly not determine
their policy upon the choice between Stalin and the Polish Government
in Exile. They understand that neither the one nor the other can
solve the problems of the Polish masses &ndash; problems of national
liberation, of economic security and freedom. They will steer their
course on the basis of the fundamental line of a Socialist United
States of Europe. This means raising the demand for the right of
national self-determination for all peoples living in prewar Poland.
This means raising the slogan of an independent Soviet Poland.</em></p>

<p>No one will underestimate the difficulties confronting the
advanced Polish workers in spreading their ideas. The GPU is a force
to be reckoned with. Nevertheless there will, in all probability, be
&ldquo;democratic cracks&rdquo; through which, in the first period,
the revolutionary Polish Marxists will be able to spread their
propaganda. To fool the gullible and to give Churchill and Roosevelt
a chance to say that Stalin has kept his promises, the Kremlin ruler
may permit some degree of democracy. If he does, the revolutionary
workers of Poland will utilize the opportunity to put forth their own
program against Stalin and against the Polish Government-in-Exile.</p>
