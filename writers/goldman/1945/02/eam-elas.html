<p class="fst">To explain why we supported the struggle of the Greek masses under
the leadership of the EAM-ELAS, against the British imperialists and
their Greek puppets, it is necessary to analyze the character of that
struggle.</p>

<p>In the Spanish civil war the Trotskyists gave material support to
the Loyalist government in its fight against Franco because we
considered that fight to be one for bourgeois democracy against
fascism. Every one who read our literature knew that we were opposed
to the Loyalist Government and would not have hesitated to replace it
with a workers&rsquo; and peasants&rsquo; government had we had a
majority of the people behind us. But our opposition to the Loyalist
Government did not prevent us from giving it material support as
against Franco. Bourgeois democracy is an evil which we want to
replace with workers&rsquo; democracy but it is to be defended
against fascism.</p>

<p>Was the struggle of the EAM-ELAS one that can be said to have
been similar in character to the struggle of the Loyalist Government
against Franco? On the side of the EAM the leadership was certainly
fighting for no more than bourgeois democracy. Undoubtedly there were
fascists supporting the Greek Government and its British masters.</p>

<p><em>But it would be stretching the meaning of fascism far too much
to say that the British imperialists and their Greek puppets
represented fascism. As events showed they were perfectly willing to
cover their rule with democratic promises, later to be fulfilled or
not, depending on the militancy and power of the masses. While they
used the methods of fascist dictatorship, the language was bourgeois
democratic in character. The British masters and the Greek servants
represented reaction in general but not that specific form of
reaction which we designate by the term fascism.</em></p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">Since the dominant role in the civil war against the EAM was
played by the British imperialist army, it is very easy to fall into
the error of considering the struggle to have been predominantly a
national liberation struggle. That it had aspects of such a struggle
is undeniable. For a long time Greece has been a semi-colonial
country dominated by British finance capitalism. The fact that the
Greek monarch, of German origin, remained loyal to the British
imperialists shows how closely the Greek ruling class is connected
with the class represented by Churchill.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>National Liberation</h4>

<p class="fst">The Greek masses had just gotten rid of the German imperialist
yoke and consequently were very sensitive to Churchill&rsquo;s
attempt to decide the fate of Greece. It is undoubtedly true that
many joined the EAM because they wanted the Greek people to be free
of any alien control.</p>

<p>Revolutionary Marxists support struggles for national liberation
except where they are submerged in an imperialist conflict. Under the
particular conditions of the Greek civil war we could readily support
those aspects of the EAM struggle which can be said to have been part
of a struggle for national liberation. But it would be wrong to
consider the struggle of the EAM as primarily a struggle for national
liberation. One need only consider a struggle of the masses of India
against British imperialism to realize the difference between the
character of a struggle which is primarily one for national
liberation and a struggle like the one waged by the Greek masses, in
which the aspects of national liberation are present but are
secondary in importance.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p class="fst">The essential nature of the Greek civil war was a struggle of the
masses against all the reactionary capitalist forces represented by
the monarchy and supported by British imperialism. When the
Papandreou Government, under Churchill&rsquo;s orders, directed the
ELAS troops to surrender their weapons, the masses realized that it
could only mean an attempt to reinstate the monarchy and the
reactionary forces behind it and thus to prevent the workers and
peasants from establishing a government devoted exclusively to their
interests. In a certain sense the action of the Greek masses is
analogous to the action of the Russian masses in February 1917, when
they overthrew the Czar, and in September 1917 when they fought
against Kornilov who organized the reactionary monarchical and
bourgeois forces in an attempt to overthrow Kerensky. The Russian
masses did not want the monarchy and all that it represented and the
same is true of the Greek masses.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Popular Front</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>The struggle of the EAM was not one which had as its aim the
establishment of a workers&rsquo; and peasants&rsquo; government
determined to do its part in organizing a Socialist United States of
Europe. The masses followed the EAM at the head of which was a
combination of Stalinists, Social-Democrats and liberals. The
leadership of the EAM is similar in character to the Spanish Popular
Front Government. The Greek masses undoubtedly want a fundamental
social change. That was also true of the Spanish masses in the
Spanish civil war. But the Greek masses were following a leadership
which limited itself to a struggle against the reactionary forces
represented mainly by the monarchy and supported by British
imperialism, just as the Spanish masses followed a leadership which
limited itself to a struggle against fascism and for bourgeois
democracy.</em></p>

<p>A common factor in the Russian Revolution of February 1917, in the
struggle of the Russian masses against Kornilov, in the Spanish civil
war and in the Greek civil war, is that objectively they can all be
considered a stage in the struggle of the masses to establish their
own workers&rsquo; and peasants&rsquo; government. The victory of the
Russian masses in the February Revolution and against Kornilov
permitted them to go on to the October Revolution. The defeat of the
Loyalist Government was a set-back to the workers&rsquo; revolution
in Spain. The compromise between the EAM and the reactionary forces
in Greece, disarming the ELAS soldiers, constitutes a terrible blow
to the Greek workers and peasants.</p>

<p>On the part of the masses the struggles I mentioned above were'
struggles to make possible the victory of the workers&rsquo;
revolution. As revolutionary Marxists we were obligated to support
those struggles.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<h4>Attitude Toward EAM</h4>

<p class="fst">At present we do not know to what extent Trotskyists participated
in the struggle on the side of the EAM. We can take it for granted
that there were many doing their utmost to defeat the British
imperialists and their Greek puppets. Participating in that struggle,
they undoubtedly explained to the worker-soldiers of the ELAS why
they gave material but not political support to the struggle of the
EAM. Their explanation must have been in somewhat the following
manner:</p>

<ol>
<li>We are fighting with you for the defeat of the reactionary
forces represented by the monarchy and supported by British
imperialism. We give material support to the EAM because the
struggle it is waging is a progressive one.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li>We give no political support to the EAM because at the head
of that organization is a Popular-Front combination that is
satisfied with capitalist democracy. What the Greek masses need to
solve their vital problems is a government of workers and peasants
dedicated to the task of aiding in the establishment of a Socialist
United States of Europe.<br />
&nbsp;</li>

<li><em>We warn you that the leadership of the EAM will make some
compromise with the British imperialists and their puppets. Take
power into your own hands and call upon the working masses of Europe
and America to come to your aid.</em></li>
</ol>
