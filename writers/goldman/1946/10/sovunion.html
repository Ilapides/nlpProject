<p class="fst"><small>The following article by Albert Goldman, leader of the former
Minority Group of the Socialist Workers Party (a great section of
which under his leadership, joined the Workers Party), is a
presentation of his views on a question on which <strong>The New
International</strong> and the WP have a fully developed different
position. But in line with our practice we are publishing his
views as a discussion article. We believe this to be in the best
tradition of revolutionary Marxism. More important than that,
however, Comrade Goldman&#8217;s article is a contribution on a
subject which continues to remain one of the most important before
the international revolutionary socialist movement. The
publication of this article is not the opening of a discussion on
the Russian question which we have carried on several previous
occasions. Its publication is for the purpose of acquainting our
readers with the views of the writer.</small></p>

<p><small>Readers of <strong>The New International </strong>are, of course,
familiar with its views, namely, that Russia is a bureaucratic
collectivist society; a new exploitive social order; the most
powerful counter-revolutionary force in the world today, pursuing
an imperialist policy of its own and, from the point of view of
the masses, no different from the imperialism of monopoly
capitalism. Under bureaucratic collectivism, Russian society is a
&#8220;slave&#8221; society for the mass of workers and peasants, having
not the slightest resemblance to socialism.</small></p>

<p><small>We do not agree with Comrade Goldman&#8217;s comments on our
theoretical analysis of the character of the Russian state. That
there are difficulties involved in the theory, goes without
saying, but they are as nothing when compared to those involved in
the theory of &#8220;a degenerated workers&#8217; state,&#8221; or that of
Russia as a capitalist-fascist state. With the aid of the theory
of bureaucratic collectivism we have been able to develop a valid
estimate of Russia&#8217;s role and to orient our movement correctly
in world events as against all others during the past almost seven
years. The same cannot be said for those who adhered to the
&#8220;degenerated workers&#8217; state&#8221; concept. Further, it is our
opinion that the views of Comrade Goldman represent a moving away
from that untenable theory held by the official organizations of
the Fourth International, toward the views of the Workers Party
and thus represent a particularly interesting contribution to the
discussion. &#8211; <em>Editor</em></small></p>

<hr class="section" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="fst">From the point of view of those struggling for the socialist
revolution the outstanding fact of World War II is that the
revolution did not emerge from the war to destroy the Stalinist
bureaucracy as we hoped and expected, but that the Stalinist
bureaucracy was the greatest single factor in preventing a successful
socialist revolution in Europe.</p>

<p>One can point to certain beginnings of a socialist revolutionary
movement at the time when the Hitler military machine was cracking
up; one can point to certain sections of Europe where undoubtedly the
masses were ready to take power. But all this does not and cannot
alter the fact that there has been no revolution in Europe for the
fundamental reason that the Stalinist bureaucracy prevented the
socialist revolution from developing.</p>

<p>In Eastern Europe the Stalinist armies crushed every attempt on
the part of the masses to take power and at the present moment the
masses of those countries are practically slaves of the Stalinist
bureaucracy. In the important countries of Western Europe the
Stalinist parties have gained command over the decisive sections of
the working class and have, by their policies prevented any attempt
at revolution. In France and Italy the workers have flocked to the
Stalinist banner because they want a socialist revolution. Without
the Stalinist parties only the bayonets of the American and English
imperialist armies could have crushed any revolutionary uprising. It
can be said with the greatest of certainty that the Stalinist
bureaucracy is the most powerful counter-revolutionary factor on the.
European scene.</p>

<p>The contention is put forward that our mistake in believing that
the revolution would arise as a result of the war and destroy
Stalinism is one involving tempo. (We also thought that if the
revolution did not arise and destroy the Stalinist bureaucracy, the
forces of capitalism would do away with it. But that is immaterial
for the argument in this article.) We can grant the proposition that
our mistake is one of tempo but this does not in the least modify the
proposition that the victory of the Stalinist armies is the greatest
danger to the socialist revolution. This has been proved beyond the
shadow of a doubt and every serious revolutionist who up to now has
advocated the &#8220;defense of the Soviet Union&#8221; should take that
factor into consideration in determining his attitude to that slogan.</p>

<p>Trotsky was careful to explain that our defense of Russia means
primarily an explanation to the masses of what we defend and how we
defend it. He was exceedingly anxious to have everyone clearly
understand that we are not for one moment defending any of the
policies of the Stalinist bureaucracy. But this did not do away with
the fact that in any war between Russia and a capitalist country
those who were for the defense of the Soviet Union were for the
victory of the &#8220;Red&#8221; army and were obliged to do their best to
help achieve that victory.</p>

<p>But at present, knowing what the consequences of a victory of the
Stalinist army must be to the socialist revolution, is it still
possible to advocate the defense of Russia, that is, the victory of
the Stalinist armies? The answer is that a revolutionist who is not
bound by a formula will not do so. The answer is that a revolutionary
Marxist who sees and accepts the obvious fact that to defend
Stalinist Russia means to hope and, if possible, work for the victory
of an army that is certain to crush any socialist revolutionary
uprising, will give up the slogan of &#8220;defense of the Soviet Union.&#8221;</p>

<p>We have always accepted the idea that the defense of Russia must
be subordinated to the interests of the world revolution. We know now
what we did not know in 1940 &#8211; that the victory of the Stalinist
army is detrimental to the world revolution just as the victory of
any capitalist country would be.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&#8220;Nationalized Property &#8211; Therefore Defense&#8221;</h4>

<p class="fst">Must the conclusion be drawn from the above that we who advocated
&#8220;defending the Soviet Union&#8221; in 1940 were wrong?&#8217;Only in the
sense that the formula upon which we fundamentally based our defense
of Russia was an incorrect one. That formula was &#8220;nationalized
property &#8211; therefore defense.&#8221; It was the fact that nationalized
property was something still left of the 1917 Revolution that made it
necessary for some of us to call Russia a &#8220;workers&#8217; state&#8221; even
though degenerated. And it was this nationalized property that we
said made it necessary for us to defend Russia. That bare formula
must now be rejected completely. For it leads to the dangerous
conclusion that we defend an army the victory of which can lead only
to counter-revolutionary consequences.</p>

<p>Far more correct would it have been had we said that nationalized
property under the conditions prevailing in 1940 justified our
position of defense. We certainly did not know what the results of
the war would be; in fact we expected the proletarian revolution or
capitalism to destroy Stalinism. Itwas correct for us to test to the
end the theory that the war may bring the proletarian revolution and
it, in &#8217;its tum, smash the Stalinist bureaucracy. One of the most
important of the conditions prevailing in 1940 was the expectation
that either the revolution or capitalism would destroy the Kremlin
bureaucracy. One can make out a fair case for the proposition that
Trotsky actually thought that defense was necessary in 1940 partly
because he expected the overthrow of the Stalinist bureaucracy in the
not too far-distant future.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We might place ourselves in a ludicrous position,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;if we affixed to the Bonapartist oligarchy the
nomenclature of a new class just a few years or even a few months
prior to its inglorious downfall.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Trotsky always felt it necessary to operate on that theory, which
looked forward to a favorable outcome for the proletarian revolution,
until events proved conclusively that it could not be held any
longer. Until the very last minute he worked on the theory that the
Nazis could be prevented from taking power. There were those who,
after the Nazis took power, pointed out that Trotsky was wrong in
this theory, forgetting that it was only such a theory that could
constitute the basis of a continuation of the struggle against the
Nazis and that a revolutionist had no right to say beforehand that
the struggle against the Nazis was in vain.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar situation existed with reference to the
question of defending Russia. So long as it was possible to expect
that the war and a victory of the Russian armies might lead to a
proletarian revolution and the regeneration of Russia, so long was it
justifiable to retain the position of its defense.</p>

<p>But if it was justifiable to defend Stalinist Russia in 1940, when
history had not as yet showed us what exactly the victory of the
Stalinist army would mean, it is criminal to do so now when we know
what a victory of the Stalinist army must inevitably lead to.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Defense and the Consciousness of the Masses</h4>

<p class="fst">The threat which a victory of the Stalinist army presents to the
socialist revolution is by itself sufficient to warrant a change from
defending Stalinist Russia to non-defense. There are, however,
additional factors which should be taken into consideration by those
who still cling to the old formula. The plundering of the occupied
countries and the enslavement of millions of German and Japanese
workers whose only crime was to be drafted into the armies of their
oppressors make a change mandatory on the question of defense. How
can we ask the workers of Germany and Japan who have experienced the
frightful terror of slave labor in Stalin&#8217;s Russia to defend that
country? How can we ask the semi-enslaved workers of the Eastern
European countries to defend Stalin&#8217;s Russia?</p>

<p>Terrible were the crimes of Stalin in executing hundreds of
thousands of people who were loyal to the revolution on the pretext
that they were enemies of the working class. Dreadful are the
conditions of the masses in Russia. But it remains a fact that the
masses outside of Russia were never deeply stirred by the crimes of
Stalin against the people of that country. Either they were unaware
of those crimes or they considered the struggle between Stalin and
his opponents as of no concern to them. But now millions of people
have become aware of the terrible cruelty of that monster and it is
impossible to ask them to help his army to victory and thus help
forge their own chains.</p>

<p>It can be said that we always made a distinction between the
&#8220;Soviet Union&#8221; and the Stalinist regime and we never assumed the
slightest responsibility for the crimes of Stalin. It was under the
best of circumstances a difficult task to make that distinction. At
present, however, it is an impossible task. Tell the tortured slaves
in the slave labor camps of Russia, tell the semi-slaves of the
Eastern European countries that they should only defend the
nationalized property and their answer, with venom and hatred will
be: but in order to defend this nationalized property I must work for
the victory of an army that will bring torture and slavery to me. You
who are defenders may be willing to help build your own funeral pyre
but not we.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What About the Nature of the Russian state?</h4>

<p class="fst">Does it follow that we must reject the concept of a degenerated
workers&#8217; state for Stalinist Russia because we reject its defense?
For the present that is not at all necessary.</p>

<p>We can call a junked automobile an automobile although it cannot
be used for anything but junk. We call Stalinist Russia a degenerated
workers&#8217; state because Russia was once a workers&#8217; state and at
present we do not know what actually is developing out of it. In
truth it is necessary, for the present, to cling to the concept of
degenerated workers&#8217; state because no one has succeeded in
presenting us with a theory as to its nature which has less
difficulties than those involved in the theory of degenerated
workers&#8217; state. What was once a workers&#8217; state and subsequently a
degenerated workers&#8217; state has not developed to a point where we
can be certain of its nature.</p>

<p>One can easily admit the difficulties connected with the theory of
degenerated workers&#8217; state but then the difficulties involved in
the theory of bureaucratic collectivism are much greater. On the
basis of that theory one must hold that it is possible 1: that a
class (bureaucratic collectivist) can arise which does not play a
progressive role in comparison with the class (capitalist) it
displaces; 2: that a new class can arise, the existence of which can
be limited to one country. In a world made interdependent by
capitalist imperialism this is indeed a difficult concept &#8211; almost
as difficult as the theory of socialism in one country.</p>

<p>Marx postulated the theory of the rule of the working class and
the development of socialism as a result of the contradictions of
capitalism. There is a very strong implication in the theory of
bureaucratic collectivism of a social order following capitalism
which is not socialism but bureaucratic collectivism. There is, of
course, nothing sacred about any theory of Marx and if events compel
us to revise it we should do so. But one should not lightly change a
theory which is of tremendous aid in the struggle for socialism. The
theory of degenerated worker&#8217;s state is far more in consonance with
Marxism and since the difficulties connected with that theory are
less than the difficulties connected with the theory of bureaucratic
collectivism, it is to be preferred as against the latter theory.</p>

<p>The theory that state capitalism exists in Stalinist Russia has
the advantage of connecting the exploitation that is going on in
Russia with capitalist exploitation. But essentially it raises the
same problems and difficulties as the theory of bureaucratic collectivism.</p>

<p>To those who would argue that to call Stalinist Russia a
degenerated workers&#8217; state means that it is necessary to defend it
against capitalist attack, we can say with the greatest conviction
that history has proved that a degenerated workers&#8217; state under a
Stalinist regime can do far greater harm to the socialist revolution
than some capitalist states.</p>

<p>To defend Stalinist Russia because it is a degenerated workers&#8217;
state and to disregard the fact that to defend it means to work for
the victory of an army that is sure to crush the every attempt at
socialist revolution is to become a prisoner of formulas. No real
Marxist is a prisoner of formulas.</p>
