<p class="fst">The task facing the representatives of American imperialism at the eighth Pan-American Conference to be held at Lima, Peru, beginning on Dec. 9, will be to extend the &#8220;good neighbor&#8221; policy.</p>

<p>That policy, which consists of substituting silk gloves for the naked fist is the method used by U.S. imperialism to assure its supremacy in the Latin-American countries, does not actually begin with the present administration. When Calvin Coolidge sent Dwight Morrow, partner of J.P. Morgan, as ambassador to Mexico in 1927, he in fact adopted that policy. President Roosevelt extended it to apply to all Latin-American countries, labelled it as such and made it popular.</p>

<p>Under present conditions the &#8220;good neighbor&#8221; policy demands amplification. American imperialism sees grave possibilities of losing the Latin-American market as its own special preserve. And facing a real threat of being deprived of the Far East as a market and field for investment by the victorious march of the Japanese armies, it is determined to keep the western hemisphere for itself. Agreed on Hemisphere Control Not that it is reconciled to the loss of China. Certain sections of the American capitalist class, particularly those of the middle west, see no great profits to be reaped by fighting the Japanese imperialists for the right to exploit China. These mid-western capitalists advocate an exclusive concentration upon both American continents. Other capitalist groups are unwilling to surrender the Chinese market without a struggle. All sections of the capitalist class, however, agree that the western hemisphere belongs to them.</p>

<p>Faced with the situation where competing imperialist powers, especially Germany and Japan, are making serious inroads in the Latin-American market, American capitalism finds it necessary to obtain the active co-operation of the Latin-American countries. To be a good neighbor implies nothing more than a willingness to be friendly and to offer aid in case of need. It is more of a passive than an active attitude. What is required now, as far as American imperialism is concerned, is an active union of all Latin-American countries, under its tutelage, to defeat all possible competitors. To achieve that active union will be the goal of Secretary Hull and his fellow-delegates.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Obstacles to Overcome</h4>

<p class="fst">Certain difficulties must be overcome by U.S. imperialism. It has been pointed out that in the last analysis American capitalism, in order to compete successfully, must be able to sell better goods at cheaper prices. All other methods of conquering the Latin-American market are subsidiary, at least for the present, when the idea of annexing Latin America and keeping competitors out by force has not been given serious consideration. American capitalism feels confident of its ability to compete with any rival capitalist country.</p>

<p>The advantage which a totalitarian capitalist regime has over a democratic capitalist country is considerable. U.S. capitalism has to overcome the disadvantage of lack of centralization and the existence of a working class that is still free to struggle for higher wages and better conditions. Should its wealth and superior industrial machine fail to bring victory to American imperialism in its economic war with the poverty-stricken totalitarian regimes, then more forceful measures will be taken both in the form of an attempt to reduce the living standards of the American workers and of keeping its rivals out of Latin America.</p>

<p>Knowing that they are being courted on all sides, the Latin-American capitalists are holding out for a high price. They demand not only good and cheap commodities but also entertainment and flattery. The capitalists of this country have decided to be very careful in their salesmanship methods and fortunately for them the pastor-like Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, suits their purposes in all respects. The most sanctimonious platitudes are ready to roll off his tongue at every opportunity.</p>

<p>If he doesn&#8217;t fool the politicians he at least convinces a great number of people both in this country and in the Latin-American countries that the United States is interested in nothing else than to build up friendly and neighborly relations between all countries of the western hemisphere for their mutual benefit and for protection against dictatorships.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Path Is Not Smooth</h4>

<p class="fst">The path is not altogether smooth. The stern attitude of the Roosevelt government in attempting to protect the oil properties of the American capitalists in Mexico will require explanation and Secretary Hull will not find the task an easy one. The claim that the United States is interested in guarding the democracies of the western hemisphere will sound a little hollow in view of the dictatorial character of the vast majority of the Latin-American countries. But all these are regarded as minor problems. In the great task of entrenching American imperialism in the Latin-American nations, black can be easily made to appear white, especially by such a religiously devout gentleman as the Secretary of State.</p>
