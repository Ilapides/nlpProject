<p class="fst"><B>Los Angeles</B> &ndash; Part of the machinery set into
motion-by the United Front anti-Fascist letter of the C.I. was an
anti-Hitler united front conference in Los Angeles on April 28.</P>
<P>This conference was not called by the Communist party but by a
united front provisional organization of German groups.</P>
<P>Proof that the &ldquo;united front from below under revolutionary
leadership&rdquo; has gone the way of the &ldquo;third period&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;struggle for the streets&rdquo; was had by the fact
that neither the Communist party nor the Young Communist League were
represented officially.</P>
<P>We presume, their assumption was that their presence there would
frighten from the &ldquo;broad united front&rdquo; the three branches
of the ILD, the IWO, the FSU, the friends of the Polish Political
Prisoners, the LSU, the Icor, and the Unemployed Council as well as
two or three German speaking organizations: Workingmen&rsquo;s
Benefit, Maennerchor, etc. And by no means shall we forget the
Cremation Society who were present, too.</P>
<P>The only Communist organization openly participating was the Left
Opposition.</P>
<P>A delegate of the Left Opposition was placed on the resolutions
committee. In this committee he proposed three resolutions, in
addition to the two already proposed. One of the resolutions, on the
struggle against fascism, stood for a united front with all labor
organizations against the fascist attacks, particularly with the
socialist party. The socialist party was condemned for refusing to
participate in this conference.</P>
<P>Other resolutions, on anti-Semitism pointed out that the struggle
against Fascism and anti-Semitism by the Jews could only be waged by
the lower social strata allying themselves with the proletariat, and
demonstrated that only a new social order could abolish religious and
racial prejudices.</P>
<P>The third resolution on the Defense of the Soviet Union showed
that Hitler represented the spearhead of the attacks on Russia, and
the labor movement particularly in the countries intervening between
Russia and Germany must join the anti-Fascist bloc. (The party voted
against the resolutions of the L.O.)</P>
<P>The party seems determined to to make of the anti-Hitler struggle
an affair of fraternal German and Jewish groups instead of a labor
affair. The local branch off the Opposition took a determined
position against this. The consensus of opinion of revolutionaries
here is that Stalinism is ready for a nice sanitary disposal.</P>
<P>Call the Cremation Society!<BR>&nbsp;</P>
<H4>Activity of the Left Opposition</H4>
<p class="fst">The comrades in the Los Angeles branch of the League are very
active in the class struggle particularly in the mass unemployment
movement, the Unemployed Cooperative Relief Association in which they
are very influential. The organization is slowly progressing. We are
developing a group of erstwhile scissor bills into class conscious
battlers, although in this as well as in other activities we suffer
acutely from lack of forces.</P>
<P>The organization has demanded $50,000 monthly from the city. This
morning&rsquo;s newspapers state that Mayor Porter has appropriated
$20,000. The cause for this &ldquo;liberality&rdquo; is a dual one, a
combination of pre-election political activity, and the forestalling
of our movement by a political concession.</P>
<P>The movement has also gone on record for the freedom of Mooney,
has elected a delegate by proxy to the Free Mooney Congress in
Chicago.</P>
<P>Some time ago, when the U.C.R.A. placed an evicted family&rsquo;s
furniture back into the home, the man, Tibbs, was arrested. After a
nine day trial, costing the authorities at least $1,000, the verdict
was &ldquo;not guilty.&rdquo; This was a victory for the unemployed.</P>
<P>The unemployed are turning on their disconnected gas, light and
water in the tens of thousands. A number of half-hearted arrests have
taken place on this account, too.</P>
<P>Friday, April 27, a member of the organization was placed on the
streets. The unemployed determined to make a demonstration in the
form of a continual meeting 24 hours daily at a pitched tent before
the workers former home. This tactic had won shelter for the family
before.</P>
<P>In the small hours of the night, when the members keeping vigil
had dwindled to 35 warming themselves before bonfires, the police and
&ldquo;red squad&rdquo; swooped down and brutally beat the
unemployed. It was not that horror of horrors, a &ldquo;red&rdquo;,
that was clubbed but one of themselves. The unemployed are aroused.</P>
<P>So the lessons of the class struggle, of private property, of the
role of the state are being beaten home. We are busy drawing
conclusions, organizing the instinctive rebellion into revolutionary
Marxist paths.</P>
