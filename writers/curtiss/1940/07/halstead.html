<p class="fst">Editor:</p>

<p class="fst">It is with deep sorrow that we report the news of the death of Frank Halstead, of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Comrade Halstead was one of the founders of the Left Opposition movement in Los Angeles. Previous to that, he had been a member of the Young People&rsquo;s Socialist League in the days before the War, a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, and an active member of the progressive group in the Machinists Union.</p>

<p>When the writer of these lines arrived in Los Angeles, comrade Halstead was receiving and distributing a bundle of <B>Militants</B>, and speaking wherever he could for the Left Opposition, doing pioneer work in the then &ldquo;white spot&rdquo; of reaction. This period marked the beginning of the unemployed movement into which the small nucleus of the Left Opposition threw itself; beginning a left wing in the large unemployed co-operative movement. In this movement comrade Halstead was a leading figure, organizing the unemployed. Working side by side with comrade Halstead, I was able to see a real rebel in action; a rebel who combined a deep loyalty to and faith in the working class, with a clear forceful mind.</p>

<p>After starting the Left Opposition movement on its way, comrade Halstead withdrew from the movement into the role of a sympathizer. He later joined one of the splinter movements.</p>

<p>In spite of the differences between himself and our organization, the Los Angeles section of the Socialist Workers Party salutes a rebel. We are sure his work will be remembered by the working class.</p>

<p>We offer our condolences to his wife and sons.</p>
