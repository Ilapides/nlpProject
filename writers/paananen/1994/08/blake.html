<p class="fst"><strong>Witness Against the Beast: Blake and the Moral Law</strong><br/>
by E.P. Thompson<br/>
<em>Published by Cambridge University Press, 1993, &#0163;17.95</em></p>
<p class="fst">E.P. THOMPSON, THE SOCIALIST historian best known for <strong>The
Making of the English Working Class</strong>, acknowledged two sources of
inspiration for his own work (&#8216;my own patheon&#8217;): Karl Marx and
William Blake. Before his death in 1993, Thompson finished <strong>Witness
Against the Beast</strong>, which studies Blake&#8217;s opposition to the
morality, science and social values of his age, the late 18th and
early 19th centuries. Thompson places Blake&#8217;s protests in the
context of the religious opinions that had been voiced by the Ranters
and other sects in the English revolution of 1640&#8211;1660 and were
still heard from dissenting groups in Blake&#8217;s own time.</p>
<p>The Marxist historian A.L. Morton was the first to demonstrate the
similarities between Blake&#8217;s ideas and language and those of the Ranters</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The Ranters,&#8221; Morton explains, &#8220;formed the extreme
left-wing of the sects which came into prominence during the English
revolution, both theologically and politically ... The Ranters, and
they alone at this date, spoke for and to the most wretched and
submerged elements of the population, the slum dwellers of London and
other cities.&#8221; (<strong>The World of the Ranters</strong>, p.&nbsp;70)</p>
<p class="fst">Because the Ranters believed God to be literally in every human
being, they advocated the radical equality of all people, rejected
the need to adhere to the moral law emphasised by other Christian
groups, and denounced the rich while calling for ownership in common.
Around 1649, for about a year, the Ranters appear, according to
Morton, &#8220;to have attracted a mass following, especially among the
London poor&#8221;. William Blake, a Londoner born in Soho in 1757, more
than 100 years after the high point of Ranter activity, seems to echo
the Ranters in his assertations of the divinity in every individual,
in his objections to the conventional morality of his age, and in his
aspiration for a society based on the principle defined by Blake as
&#8216;all things in common&#8217;.</p>
<p>Thompson acknowledges Morton&#8217;s pioneering research but also
finds a significant degree of correspondence in content and language
between Blake&#8217;s work and the writings of the Muggletonians, a
Christian tendency made up of admirers of the preacher and writer
Ludowick Muggleton, that originated around 1652 immediately after the
period of Ranter successes. Muggletonian doctrines were similar to
Ranter doctrines and influenced by them. Thompson offers some
evidence that Blake&#8217;s mother may have been a member of the
Muggletonians. Although not himself a Christian, Thompson, feeling
the influence of both Blake and Marx, had from the time that he
started to do research on the Muggletonians, been amused to call
himself a &#8216;Muggletonian Marxist&#8217;.</p>
<p>The context provided by Morton and Thompson greatly assists the
reader of Blake who moves at all beyond the usual anthology pieces
and enters the bewildering maze of myth, radical politics and
visionary Christianity that Blake creates in such major works as
<em>Jerusalem</em>. Thompson convincingly shows that Blake&#8217;s
religious vocabulary was less eccentric than we might think: it was
in fact a language that embodied the opposition of ordinary people to
the ruling powers of the age.</p>
<p>&#8220;It struck very precisely at critical positions of the hegemonic
culture, the &#8216;common sense&#8217; of the ruling groups, which today can
be seen to be intellectually unsound and sometimes to be no more than
ideological apologetics,&#8221; Thompson writes (p.&nbsp;110). &#8220;Blake
had been taught in childhood to place a critical distance between
himself and the rich and great,&#8221; Thompson explains, and Blake
absorbed from the &#8220;pockets of radical dissent among the trades ...
a stubborn lack of deference, both social and intellectual&#8221;
(pp.&nbsp;111&#8211;112).</p>
<p>Thompson&#8217;s expert knowledge of the vocabulary and attitudes of
the age permits him to offer some powerful new readings even of
Blake&#8217;s best-known worker. Blake&#8217;s <em>London</em> Thompson shows
to be &#8220;an indictment of the acquisitive ethic, endorsed by the
institutions of the state, which divides man from man&#8221; and &#8220;brings
him into mental and moral bondage&#8221; (p.&nbsp;191).</p>
<p>Thompson&#8217;s book is not meant to provide everything that a
beginning reader of Blake&#8217;s longer works would need. Blake&#8217;s
self-generated mythic system, one of the vehicles for both his
political and religious insights, is not explained, so standard works
like Nothrop Frye&#8217;s <strong>Fearful Symmetry</strong> remain necessary. The
book does however succeed in its demonstration of Blake&#8217;s emergence
from a context of growing opposition to the new commercial and
industrial civilisation of England &#8211; and it communicates Thompson&#8217;s
passionate advocacy of Blake as an ancestor of all militant protest
against this economy and culture.</p>
<p>There is however a further step that Thompson has not taken that
would have allowed him to see more of the &#8216;Marxist&#8217; in the
&#8216;Muggletonian&#8217;. In his opposition to what he called &#8216;natural
religion&#8217;, Blake objected to the efforts of his age to understand
the external world rather than to change it, and Thompson
acknowledges Blake&#8217;s Marx-like emphasis on &#8216;activity&#8217; rather
than contemplation. The labour that Blake calls humanity to perform
is the physical as well as cultural transformation of a recognisable
modern London into &#8216;Jerusalem&#8217;. Blake&#8217;s religious vocabulary &#8211;
a voice of protest in his own age, as Thompson shows &#8211; is also able
to carry Blake&#8217;s attempt both to redefine the human
relationship to nature and to insist upon the centrality of labour:
such an enterprise clearly points toward the achievement of Marx.</p>
<p>Yet, despite Blake&#8217;s understanding of the
world in terms of dynamic &#8216;contraries&#8217;, Thompson is unwilling to
accept Blake as &#8220;a premature practitioner of Marxist dialectic&#8221;
(p.&nbsp;226). For the Marxist Thompson to come so close to a
recognition of Blake and Marx as co-workers, and then back-off, must,
I think, be a disappointment to the reader familiar with both
Blake and Marx. But Thompson has nonetheless done enough to convince
us that Blake&#8217;s work is like Marx&#8217;s, &#8220;a plank in the floor upon
which the future must walk&#8221; (p.&nbsp;228).</p>
<p>Deep within his demanding epic <em>Jerusalem</em>, Blake offers this
account of the human consequences of the industrial revolution:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">And all the Arts of Life they chang&#8217;d into the Arts of Death in Albion.<br/>
The hour-glass contemn&#8217;d because its simple workmanship<br/>
Was like workmanship of the plowman, and the water wheel<br/>
That raises water into cisterns, broken and burned with fire<br/>
Because its workmanship was like the workmanship of the shepherd;<br/>
And, in their stead, intricate wheels invented, wheel without wheel,<br/>
To perplex youth in their outgoings and to bind to labours in Albion<br/>
Of day and night the myriads of eternity: that they may grind<br/>
And polish brass and iron hour after hour, laborious task,<br/>
Kept ignorant of its use: that they might spend the days of wisdom<br/>
In sorrowful drudgery to obtain a scant pittance of bread,<br/>
In ignorance to view a small portion and think that All,<br/>
And call it Demonstration, blind to all the simple rules of life.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<em>Jerusalem</em>, Chapter three, Plate 65)</p>
</td>

<p class="fst">In Blake&#8217;s objection to &#8216;Demonstration&#8217; is heard his
objection to the categories of the bourgeois, non-dialectical
thought. His recognition that the industrial worker is permitted
knowledge of only a narrow aspect of the production of the commodity
certainly foreshadows the explanations by Marx and Engels of the
effects of the division of labour with the resulting alienation from
one&#8217;s own work.</p>
<p>London, a living symbol for the triumph of capital, has, in
Blake&#8217;s Ranter or Muggletonian language, been turned into
&#8216;Babylon&#8217;. But, in lines that are among the most widely known in
the English-speaking world, Blake announces his own total commitment
to the labour that will transform London into &#8216;Jerusalem&#8217;, and he
asks us to join in the work:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">I shall not cease from mental fight,<br/>
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,<br/>
Till we have built Jerusalem<br/>
In England&#8217;s green and pleasant land.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">Socialists could do worse than to accept E.P. Thompson&#8217;s
recommendation of both Blake and Marx as interpreters and prophets:
both saw from their London perspectives the damage to humanity that
capitalism was wreaking and both called upon us not simply to
understand this system but to change it.</p>
