<p class="fst">Vic Paananen, who died on 24 March, aged 75, was a veteran
socialist activist. A long-standing supporter of the Committee for a
Workers&#8217; International (CWI), Vic was a member of Socialist
Alternative in the US. All those who knew Vic will remember his
dedicated, inspiring commitment to Marxist ideas and the struggle to
bring about a socialist society.</p>
<p>After his retirement from Michigan State University, East Lansing,
where he was the mainstay of the Socialist Alternative branch, Vic
moved to Revere, Massachusetts, and played an active part in the
Boston branch of SA until illness limited his activities.</p>
<p>Vic published two books, <strong>William Blake</strong> and <strong>British
Marxist Criticism</strong>, as well as numerous articles and reviews. His
main literary interest was always in working-class authors whose work
appealed to working-class readers. Vic&#8217;s <a href="../1995/12/tressell.html" target="new">first article</a> for <strong>Socialism Today</strong> (to which he was an enthusiastic subscriber
from our first issue) was on Robert Tressell, author of <strong>The Ragged
Trousered Philanthropists</strong> (Issue No.&nbsp;4, December 1995). Vic
explains how this socialist classic came to be written and published:
&#8220;a book [that] is both &#8216;extremely real&#8217; as an account of
working class life and &#8216;subversive,&#8217; both of capitalism and the
lies that sustain it&#8221;. There is no doubt that it will &#8220;continue
to win hearts and minds for the tasks still ahead&#8221;.</p>
<p>For many years, Victor and his first wife, Donna, spent a few
weeks every summer in Hastings, Sussex. This was the town where
Tressell lived and worked as a housepainter and sign-writer, and Vic
delighted in showing visitors around the local sites associated with Tressell.</p>
<p>Vic also participated in some of the Dylan Thomas festivals in
Swansea, South Wales. On the fiftieth anniversary of Thomas&#8217;s
death, <strong>Socialism Today</strong> (Issue No.&nbsp;77, September 2003)
carried Vic&#8217;s illuminating article on <a href="../2003/09/thomas.html" target="new"><em>Red Dylan: The Social Vision of Dylan Thomas</em></a>. Referring to Thomas&#8217;s letters, stories
and film scripts, Vic shows (contrary to most academic accounts)
that, although he avoided explicit social commentary or propaganda,
Thomas was driven by a profound social vision based on revolutionary socialism:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;All the evidence points to Thomas holding
revolutionary convictions both before he moved from Wales to London
in 1934 and throughout his life.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">While staying in London or Sussex, Vic attended many Socialist
Party events over the years, as well as CWI summer schools in
Belgium. Despite his accomplishments, Vic was a modest person, quite
shy, but loved and respected by everyone who knew him. We will miss
his conversation and mischievous sense of humour.</p>
<p>Vic&#8217;s first wife, Donna, was tragically killed in a motor
accident in 2002. He leaves his second wife, Diane De&nbsp;Santis,
whom he married in 2011, and his sons, Karl and Neil.</p>
<p>Vic was defiant in the face of illness in recent years; his
Marxist vision was undiminished. Dylan Thomas&#8217;s words inevitably
come to mind:</p>
