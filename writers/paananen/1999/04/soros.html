<p class="fst"><strong>The Crisis of Global Capitalism</strong><br/>
by George Soros<br/>
<em>Little Brown, 1998</em></p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;THE GLOBAL capitalist system which has been
responsible for the remarkable prosperity of (the USA) in the last
decade is coming apart at the seams.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">The words quoted above do not come from the pages of <strong>Socialism
Today</strong> but they do confirm statements that we have made ever since
the global financial crisis began in Thailand in July 1997. We would
not say that the last decade has meant prosperity for working people
in the USA because workers actually worked longer hours for lower
wages, but we would agree that there is overwhelming evidence that
the &#8216;global capitalist system&#8217; is indeed &#8216;coming apart at the
seams&#8217;. What is remarkable about the statement, however, is that it
appears in the preface to a new book by George Soros, a spectacularly
successful speculator in the global financial markets of the 1990s.
Soros&#8217;s accurate diagnosis of the condition of global capitalism
formed part of his testimony to the US Congress in September 1998.</p>
<p>Normally, when Soros speaks, the markets listen, but his analysis
has been more than US money managers, flush with other people&#8217;s
money from pension schemes, want to face. Yet this is the same Soros
who made billions for his own investment fund by foreseeing both the
devaluation of the British pound in 1992 and, six months before it
happened, the 1997 crash in Thailand. It&#8217;s not wise to bet against
Soros who says, candidly, &#8220;I wonder if you would be reading this
book if I had not gained a reputation as a financial wizard&#8221; (p.&nbsp;120).</p>
<p>Soros reveals in this book that his financial acumen arises from
certain &#8220;abstract philosophical ideas&#8221;. To the astonishment of a
socialist reader, these ideas turn out to be Soros&#8217;s own version of
the relationship between subjective and objective factors in human
activity. Soros, in fact, uses language reminiscent of Marx&#8217;s
explanation in <strong>Capital</strong> of how the labor of humans differs from
the life activity of other species because it involves imagination
and anticipation. Humans, Soros explains, &#8220;seek to make an impact,
to mold reality to their desires&#8221;, and this characteristic he names
as &#8220;the active or participating function&#8221; (p.&nbsp;7). &#8220;In
situations that have thinking participants&#8221;, Soros says, &#8220;the
thoughts of these participants are part of the reality about which
they have to think&#8221;. Every Marxist understands these insights as
aspects of dialectical materialism, and even Soros feels that he must
explain that &#8220;the only reason I do not use the word dialectic more
prominently is that I do not want to be burdened by the excess
baggage that comes with it&#8221; (p.&nbsp;60). Soros&#8217;s notion of an
&#8216;excess baggage&#8217; carried by Marxist philosophy is based on his
distorted perception that &#8220;Marx propounded a deterministic theory
of history&#8221;. What Soros encountered as &#8216;Marxism&#8217; in his native
Hungary was instead a rigid, Stalinist distortion.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fst">Precisely because it is dialectical, Marxism cannot see
&#8216;determination&#8217; as more than the exertion of pressures and the
setting of limits. Because the subjective factor of conscious human
activity must be present, we cannot be certain that, despite the best
efforts of some, history will not end in barbarism rather than
socialism. Soros, rejecting &#8216;dialectic&#8217; through some false
associations the word carries for him, chooses &#8216;reflexivity&#8217; to
describe the human engagement with reality.</p>
<p>Soros&#8217;s success in forecasting markets comes from his
understanding their dialectics. Human desire creates and is part of
what passes for reality in the markets. The belief that capitalist
economists hold in an invisible hand that regulates markets and
restores equilibrium is mistaken. Soros says, in fact, that &#8220;Marx
and Engels gave a very good analysis of the capitalist system 150
years ago, better in some ways, I must say, than the equilibrium
theory of classical economics&#8221; (p.&nbsp;xxvi).</p>
<p>Soros understands that, human desire being what it is, the nature
of markets is to feed on themselves, forming &#8216;bubbles&#8217; that are
punctured with disastrous consequences: &#8220;For example, in the 1990s
the enthusiasm of international investors and bankers for Asian
shares and assets produced domestic booms spurred by high valuations
and easy credit. These booms accelerated growth in the area and
increased valuations, which in turn validated and encouraged further
capital inflows from abroad&#8221; (p.&nbsp;57). Soros hints at the
technology bubble that is evident in 1999 by noting
&#8216;self-reinforcing&#8217; interest in Internet stocks at the date of the
book&#8217;s publication in late November 1998. A stock market decline in
the USA will, Soros suggests, cause rapid decline in an economy
sustained by the &#8216;feel good factor&#8217; created by paper profits.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fst">Soros also makes the wry forecast that &#8220;the communist regime in
China will be destroyed by a capitalist crisis&#8221; (p.&nbsp;152), but
this is not the paradox that it seems. China&#8217;s regime is not
&#8216;communist&#8217; but a capitalist restorationist one which will lead
to similar results as are seen in Russia as far as the economy is
concerned. It is, however, the disastrous collapse of the Russian
economy after the introduction of capitalism that is the immediate
occasion of Soros&#8217;s book. &#8220;I am afraid&#8221;, he says, &#8220;that the
political developments triggered by the financial crisis may
eventually sweep away the global capitalist system itself&#8221; (p.&nbsp;xxviii).</p>
<p>Soros is convinced that capitalism must be saved. &#8220;Financial
markets&#8221;, he notes with some irony, &#8220;resent any kind of
government interference, but they hold a deep down belief that if
conditions get really rough the authorities will step in.&#8221; Soros
rightly feels that national governments cannot provide adequate
supervision of international finance capital. The market
fundamentalism of the Thatcher and Reagan era pushed aside residual
concerns about human values. With the IMF ultimately ineffectual,
Soros argues that an International Credit Corporation is needed to
guarantee loans that themselves reflect international standards of
transparency and collateralization. What makes Soros&#8217;s hopes
ultimately naive, however, is the belief that an international
community based on formal but not economic democracy can check the
excesses of capitalism. Capitalism is based on competition and
exploitation of labor which in turn produces a shrinking rate of
profit, overproduction of commodities that cannot be sold, recessions
and economic depressions. Soros&#8217;s illusions are like those of union
leaders who fail to see that a system sustained by exploitation
cannot be coaxed into putting effective brakes on exploitation. The
capitalist system may be forced to give some concessions from time to
time under the threat of movements of the masses, but it invariably
returns to take back what it gave.</p>
<p>Soros does reflect the views of the more far-sighted section of
international capitalism that is terrified at the dangers facing the
capitalist system. It is the job of socialists to prepare the ground
for an alternative to the inhumanity of global capitalism and make
possible a world based on democracy, prosperity and international solidarity.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fst">The capitalist class and the stock market gamblers enjoyed the
bubbles in their champagne as 1999 began, but they will soon find
that their speculative bubbles are bursting around them. This small
group of exploiters will discover that, for them, the party&#8217;s over.
In the next century, the fruits of labor will belong not to the few
but to the entire human race.</p>
