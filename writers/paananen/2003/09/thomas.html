<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I take my stand with any revolutionary body that
asserts it to be the right of all men to share, equally and
impartially, every production of man ... from the sources of
production at man&#8217;s disposal&#8221;. Dylan Thomas, <strong>New Verse</strong> (1934).</p>
<p class="fst">THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR there will be events and publications to mark
the fiftieth anniversary of the death, at the early age of 39, of
Dylan Thomas, Welsh poet, short-story writer, dramatist, and film
writer. Interest in Thomas remains high, and many of his poems (such
as <em>Do Not Go Gentle</em> and <em>Fern Hill</em>) continue to have a
wide popular appeal that few other 20th century poems retain.
Discussion of Dylan Thomas in this anniversary year must acknowledge
not only that Thomas was a poet of astonishing technical gifts but a
man fully conscious of social conditions, a thinker with a grounding
in Marxism, and a self-proclaimed revolutionary socialist.</p>
<p>Writing about Dylan Thomas got off to a bad start with a book by
Henry Treece (<strong>Dylan Thomas: &#8216;Dog Among the Fairies&#8217;</strong>) that
asserted that Thomas had outgrown the Marxism of his youth. Treece&#8217;s
book is a confused polemic against the practice of &#8216;left-wing poets
and critics&#8217;, and when Thomas was given chapters to read in
manuscript, he wrote to Treece to say, &#8220;surely it is evasive to say
my poetry has no social awareness &#8211; no evidence of contact with
society&#8221;, adding &#8220;actually, &#8216;seeking kinship&#8217; with everything
... is exactly what I do do&#8221; (Thomas, <strong>Collected Letters</strong>,
pp.&nbsp;310&#8211;11). Thomas made his opinion of Treece&#8217;s book even
more clear when a friend asked him to inscribe a copy for him, and
Thomas wrote in it &#8216;to hell with this stinking book&#8217;.</p>
<p>With Treece as a forerunner, literary critics like M.L. Rosenthal
assigned Thomas a role as the poet of &#8216;introspective personalism&#8217;.
It was readily admitted by the critics that most of Thomas&#8217;s ideas
and language were already there in his adolescent notebooks, but they
assumed that he had jettisoned his Marxism and retained the poetic
materials of this period. More recently, however, the letters
collected by Paul Ferris in 1985, the memoirs of friends and
acquaintances that have been published with some frequency, and
especially the film scripts unearthed and published by John Ackerman
in 1995, have provided powerful evidence for a consistent social &#8211;
in fact, socialist &#8211; vision in Thomas&#8217;s work and life.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>A socialist to the end</h4>
<p class="fst">JOHN MALCOLM BRINNIN, Thomas&#8217;s host and chronicler of his visits
to the USA, found him &#8220;actually more censorious of the <em>status
quo</em> than any of the other British poets&#8221;. The less than
sympathetic Brinnin says that Thomas &#8220;expressed himself strongly on
political matters and tended indiscriminately to support the far left&#8221;.</p>
<p>From these American visits, Professor William York Tindall of
Columbia University, offered an important report that has been
ignored by Thomas&#8217;s biographers.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Thomas told me (in 1952) that he was a Communist. My
disbelief was shaken, however, at a party a few days later. Here
Thomas suddenly arose, kicked the cat which turned and bit me and, to
the embarrassment of our hostess, called a distinguished and once
radical American novelist, who was also a guest, both &#8216;renegade&#8217;
and &#8216;prick&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p class="fst">One must regret the unfortunate outcome that Thomas&#8217;s explosion
had for the cat, but the incident does point to convictions
passionately held by Thomas. No doubt Thomas had, as so often, been
drinking, but <em>in vino veritas</em> [there is truth in the wine].</p>
<p>The reports from Brinnin, Tindall and others all express surprise
that, at what proved to be the end of his life, Thomas had political
interests and convictions. His description of himself as a communist
is greeted with &#8216;disbelief&#8217;. Nevertheless Thomas&#8217;s support for
a revolutionary party had been publicly announced nearly twenty years
before. Thomas&#8217;s statement in <strong>New Verse</strong> in 1934 &#8211; &#8220;I
take my stand with any revolutionary body that asserts it to be the
right of all men to share, equally and impartially, every production
of man ... from the sources of production at man&#8217;s disposal&#8221; &#8211;
was written during his close association with A.E. (&#8216;Bert&#8217;)
Trick, a man twenty-five years older than Thomas, and his political
mentor. In letters from the time of his association with this
socialist grocer &#8211; identified as &#8216;a Communist&#8217; by Thomas&#8217;s
wife Caitlin and others, but now known to be a revolutionary
socialist who remained in the Labour Party &#8211; Thomas&#8217;s politics
can be seen taking shape.</p>
<p>Twenty-five percent of the population of Thomas&#8217;s native Swansea
were chronically out of work and the letters reflect Thomas&#8217;s
awareness of the resulting conditions. In November 1933, writing to
Pamela Hansford Johnson, Thomas, just 19, speaks of &#8220;an outgrown
and decaying system&#8221; in which &#8220;light is being turned into
darkness by the capitalists and industrialists ... There is only one
thing you and I, who are of this generation, must look forward to,
must work for and pray for&#8221;, writes Thomas.</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;And, because, as we
fondly hope, we are poets and voicers not only of our personal selves
but of our social selves, we must pray for it all the more
vehemently. It is the Revolution. Later, in another letter, I will
give you a more reasoned outline of Revolution, the hard facts of
communism ... and hope that you, too, may don your scarlet tie... The
precious seeds of revolution must not be wasted.&#8221; (<strong>Letters</strong>, pp.&nbsp;55&#8211;56)</p>
<p class="fst">The letter with the &#8216;more reasoned outline of Revolution&#8217; was
apparently not written, but Thomas does write to Trevor Hughes in
January 1934 that &#8220;society to adjust itself has to break itself;
society ... has grown up rotten with its capitalist child, and only
revolutionary socialism can clean it up&#8221;. &#8220;Capitalism is a system
made for a time of scarcity&#8221;, observes Thomas, who has reached the
socialist insight that capitalism, because it seeks only profit for
the few, is not an efficient mechanism for satisfying the needs of
the many. With modern technology, it would, under socialism, be
possible to make &#8220;the truth of today the truth of fertility&#8221;
(<strong>Letters</strong>, p.&nbsp;92).</p>
<p>In a letter to Glyn Jones, Thomas labels himself a &#8216;socialist&#8217;
but on 2 May 1934 he tells Hansford Johnson, &#8220;I could go to Russia
with a Welsh Communist organisation&#8221; (<strong>Letters</strong>, p.&nbsp;127).
On 3 July 1934, when Harry Pollitt, general secretary of the
Communist Party (CP), and Tom Mann, another well-known British
Communist, were on trial for &#8216;seditious speeches in the South Wales
coalfield&#8217; Swansea seemed &#8220;the centre of all revolutionary
activities&#8221; (<strong>Letters</strong>, p.&nbsp;146). Thomas&#8217;s
characterization of the moment is understandable: thousands marched
to the Swansea Assizes at which Pollitt and Mann were being tried. &#8220;I
have just left the Socialist Party [not the Socialist Party that
produces <strong>Socialism Today</strong> in 2003!]&#8221;, Thomas tells Hansford
Johnson, &#8220;and offered my services to the Communists&#8221; (<strong>Letters</strong>, p.&nbsp;146).</p>
<p>Later in July 1934, Thomas wrote to Hansford Johnson, &#8220;If it can
be forced home on the consciousness of the people that the present
economic system is ethically bad, the seed has been planted that may
in time grow into a fine revolutionary flower&#8221;. He saw a society
&#8220;composed, at top and bottom, of financial careerists and a
proletarian army of dispossessed. Out of the negation of the
negation&#8221;, he said, &#8220;must rise the new synthesis&#8221;. He expressed
impatience with parliamentary processes for the achievement of social
ownership: &#8220;Alternatively, there is the confiscation of property by
force ... If constitutional government cannot, in the space of a year
after the next general election, fulfil their policies ... the army
and the police force must be subdued, and property taken by force&#8221;
(<strong>Letters</strong>, pp.&nbsp;158&#8211;59). At a meeting of a Swansea
literary society in October of that year, Thomas was &#8220;introduced
... as a Young Revolutionary&#8221; and answered questions about &#8220;the
Communist Erewhon&#8221; [anagram of &#8216;nowhere&#8217;, meaning &#8216;utopia&#8217;]
(<strong>Letters</strong>, pp.&nbsp;171&#8211;72).</p>
<p>Whether Thomas was actually a member of the CP is, in fact,
impossible to resolve with any sources now available. His frequent
labelling of himself as a C/communist in reported conversations in
fact left it to the transcriber to supply either a capital C or a
small one. There were and are communists, small c, who belong to
other organizations. Bert Trick, whom Thomas called a &#8216;communist
grocer&#8217;, small c, was &#8211; as his son Kerith Trick said at the Dylan
Thomas Festival in Swansea in 2000 &#8211; &#8220;always a member of the
Labour Party, albeit on the extreme left&#8221;. Until the era of Tony
Blair, the Labour Party included socialists, many of them
Trotskyists, but now of course Clause Four advocating public
ownership has been dropped, and most socialists not expelled from the
Labour Party have left.</p>
<p>All the evidence points to Thomas&#8217;s holding revolutionary
convictions both before he moved from Wales to London in 1934 and
throughout his life. In 1944, for instance, Thomas wanted the
Communist Party cultural journal <strong>Our Time</strong> to publish <em>Ceremony
after a Fire Raid</em>, &#8216;pressing&#8217; the poem &#8220;upon [Arnold]
Rattenbury because, he said, he wanted to advertise that he remained
a socialist&#8221; (Hobday, p.&nbsp;233). Thomas contributed not only to
<strong>Our Time</strong> but to its successor Communist Party periodicals
<strong>Arena</strong> and <strong>Circus</strong>. On his 1952 visit to America, he also
agreed to do a poetry reading for the Socialist Party of the USA
without expecting his usual fee. And, as we have seen, Thomas called
himself a communist and relished opportunities for political
discussion in the final days in New York city.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly though, Thomas, who was ill-at-ease with the
university-educated and with academics, disliked the sort of
communist intellectual that was a characteristic product of the
1930s. As he said, he disliked them precisely &#8220;as revolutionaries
and as communists, for, born in fairly wealthy middle-class homes,
educated at expensive prep schools, public schools, and universities,
they have no idea at all of what they priggishly call &#8216;the class
struggle&#8217; and no contact at all with either any of the real motives
or the real protagonists of that class struggle&#8221; (<strong>Letters</strong>,
p.&nbsp;185). These were the kind of people that Bert Trick had
taught him to call &#8216;Parlour Pinks&#8217;. Thomas, in his own
&#8220;semi-proletarian, bourgeois, provincial upbringing&#8221; had seen in
Depression era-Wales the material basis for the class struggle that a
Marxist understands to be the motive force of history. In opposition
to theoretical Marxists, who would as poets try to versify theory,
Thomas appealed to concrete experience and to a perspective that
embraces what Karl Marx would call the totality of human
life-activity. &#8220;The individual in the mass and the mass in the
individual&#8221;, Thomas said, &#8220;can be made poetically important only
when the status and the position of both mass and individual are
considered by that part of the consciousness which is outside both&#8221;
(<strong>Letters</strong>, p.&nbsp;185).</p>
<p>In this often misunderstood rejection by Thomas of the literary
Marxists of the 1930s, one can in fact recognize the stance that he
would take in his own poetry, rejecting propagandizing for the search
for that authentic human being-in-the world that awaits humanity when
alienation and indeed class struggle ceases. Of course, as the
language in the letters shows, Dylan Thomas had some knowledge of
Marx, gained, probably, under Trick&#8217;s tutelage. And, as his prose
writings and film scripts reveal, he understood poverty and class
consciousness and could describe them as experienced in Wales and the world.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Dylan Thomas as social writer</h4>
<p class="fst">BECAUSE THERE IS not room here for a close analysis of Thomas&#8217;s
socially conscious writing, a few examples must suffice. <em>The
Peaches</em>, one of Thomas&#8217;s finest and most often reprinted
stories, is, for instance, a story about class consciousness. Annie,
based on Thomas&#8217;s beloved aunt, Ann Jones, &#8216;brown-skinned,
toothless, hunchbacked,&#8217; forgetfully wearing her usual tennis
shoes, despite having changed into her best dress, tries to please
her wealthy relative, Mrs Williams, by serving a can of peaches she
has saved for a long time. Mrs Williams, whose physical uneasiness in
a poor household has been evident throughout, will not eat in Mrs
Jones&#8217;s smelly parlour: &#8216;I can&#8217;t bear peaches&#8217;. This refusal
leads to a final break between these class-divided relatives, with Mr
Jones in his rage demanding, &#8220;Who does she think she is? Aren&#8217;t
peaches good enough for her? To hell with her bloody motor car and
her bloody son! Making us small.&#8221; Because of the refusal of the
peaches, Mrs Williams&#8217;s son, Jack, and the young Dylan are, at the
end of the story, on opposite sides of the barrier of class: &#8220;The
chauffeur came back. The car drove off, scattering the hens. I ran
out of the stable to wave to Jack. He sat still and stiff by his
mother&#8217;s side.&#8221; There can be few demonstrations in literature of
how class consciousness is created more sensitive or more accurate
than <em>The Peaches</em>.</p>
<p>The film-scripts reveal a socialist understanding of the cost to
humanity of a failed economic system. <em>Wales &#8211; Green Mountain, Black
Mountain</em> was too political for the British Council to show overseas.
One memorable passage answers the early critics who said that Thomas
ignored the social reality of Depression-era Wales:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">Remember the procession of the old-young men<br/>
From dole queue to corner and back again,<br/>
From the pinched, packed streets to the peak of slag<br/>
In the bite of the winters with shovel and bag,<br/>
With a drooping fag and a turned up collar,<br/>
Stamping for the cold at the ill lit corner<br/>
Dragging through the squalor with their hearts like lead<br/>
Staring at the hunger and the shut pit-head<br/>
Nothing in their pockets, nothing home to eat,<br/>
Lagging from the slag heap to the pinched, packed street.<br/>
Remember the procession of the old-young men.<br/>
It shall never happen again.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">The &#8216;old-young men&#8217; have been denied the opportunity for free
creative labour that humans require. Such lives are over before they
have begun: a point made again in the image of &#8220;the hunger born pit
boy&#8221; that Thomas uses to invoke Wales in Our Country, another of
his documentary films. Socialists demand a society &#8220;in which the
free development of each is the condition for the free development of
all&#8221; (Marx), and Thomas, with his concern for unlived lives, makes
such a demand. In <em>A City Re-born</em>, which focuses on Coventry in
England, Thomas&#8217;s commentary asserts that &#8220;After the war there
can be no thinking of returning to the good old days, the days of
cramped housing in crippling streets&#8221;. In the same film, the
comment about war-time production is that it &#8220;makes you think what
a hell of a lot they can produce if it&#8217;s for use and not for sale
...&#8221; No wonder that, as John Ackerman writes, &#8220;there were
objections to some sections of the film&#8221; which had the appearance
&#8220;of political propaganda&#8221;.</p>
<p>The <em>Introduction</em> to John Ackerman&#8217;s 1995 edition of
Thomas&#8217;s film scripts announces a changed view of Thomas&#8217;s
political commitment from the opinions that had been usual since
Treece. Ackerman writes, &#8220;Instinctively on the left, [Dylan Thomas]
was one of the few poets of the 1930s who remained steadfast in his
political allegiance throughout his life&#8221;. The British documentary
film movement was from the days of John Grierson onwards left-wing in
its orientation and, as Ackerman says, &#8220;Dylan Thomas was
comfortably at home with the political ethos of those working on the
documentary propaganda films&#8221;. Quoting Thomas&#8217;s statement that
&#8220;writers should keep their opinions for their prose&#8221;, Ackerman
says that Thomas&#8217;s &#8220;work on these documentary films encouraged
him to articulate political and social views&#8221;.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Marxist poet: beyond propaganda</h4>
<p class="fst">THOMAS&#8217;S SOCIAL VISION is one that longs for an outcome in which
alienated existence ends and humanity assumes its place in natural
process. But Thomas would not write &#8216;propaganda&#8217; poetry, or
rather he would not &#8216;publish&#8217; such poetry except as it would be
heard as commentary in the film-scripts. A study of his notebooks
supports Ralph Maud&#8217;s recognition that &#8220;Thomas could write about
&#8216;the century&#8217;, &#8216;the state&#8217;, &#8216;civilization&#8217;, and &#8216;man&#8217;s
man-made spare time&#8217; (i.e. unemployment) with the rest of the
thirties poets&#8221;. The differences between the notebooks and the
collected poems reveal a conscious decision, however, not to include
direct social commentary in his published work. Thomas, with his
revolutionary outlook, saw through bourgeois social arrangements &#8211;
of which he offered a critique in his letters, his published prose,
and the film-scripts &#8211; to the more fundamental and enduring
processes of nature.</p>
<p>Thomas chose, in his poetry, not to write propaganda within
bourgeois society, but to write for the timeless realm that comes
with the removal of classes. This approach appears in one of Thomas&#8217;s
earliest poems:</p>

<table cellspacing="3" cellpassing="3" align="center">
<tr>
<td>
<p class="quoteb">And death shall have no dominion.<br/>
Dead men naked they shall be one<br/>
With the man in the wind and the west moon;<br/>
When their bones are picked clean and the clean bones gone,<br/>
They shall have stars at elbow and foot;<br/>
Though they go mad they shall be sane,<br/>
Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again;<br/>
Though lovers be lost love shall not;<br/>
And death shall have no dominion.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">Here Thomas speaks out of the freedom that is the consciousness of
necessity. He is not tied to a self-absorbed ego, but he loses self
in common humanity and in process. When Thomas writes, &#8216;Though
lovers be lost love shall not;/ And death shall have no dominion&#8217;,
he recognizes that the individual passes but that what his fellow
poet and critic Christopher Caudwell calls &#8220;desires as ancient and
punctual as the stars&#8221; endure.</p>
<p>Perhaps Dylan Thomas should have written propaganda poetry as did
his less radical contemporaries; but what he did write gives him a
stronger claim to readers in the more fully human world of the
socialist future in which social conflict and inequality will no
longer inhibit human development and self-knowledge.</p>
