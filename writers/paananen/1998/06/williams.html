<p class="fst"><strong>JANUARY 1998 MARKED the passage of ten years since the death of
Raymond Williams, the individual who made the largest contribution to
Marxist literary and cultural criticism of anyone writing in Britain
this century. For Marxist criticism to advance, it had to become more
thoroughly Marxist, indeed more thoroughly materialist, than it had
yet been. The materialist outlook of Marxism sees the work that
humans do in the world &#8211; the labour process itself &#8211; as the
fundamental reality. Labour is always a material and social process,
and Marx laid out the basis for an understanding of literary and
other kinds of &#8216;artistic&#8217; production as labour too.</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Marx&#8217;s early work on this topic received too
little attention, and artistic production came to be looked at as
different from other labour. As will be suggested later, Williams
might have made his argument for the centrality of labour even more
explicit. Nonetheless, he was the Marxist critic who turned criticism
&#8216;right-side-up&#8217;, and he fully deserves the wide influence that he
now has around the world.</p>
<p>Williams&#8217; questioning in depth of the Marxist tradition in
literary criticism produced not only better Marxist criticism but a
more comprehensive understanding of what Marx actually said.
William&#8217;s intuitions about the way to proceed seemed to have been
sound from the outset, but he had nonetheless to clear the way
forward, re-thinking and rejecting much of the guidance of earlier
British Marxists like Christopher Caudwell, Ralph Fox and Alick West.
He also resisted the influence of the idealist Marxism emanating from
continental theorists, especially Louis Althusser.</p>
<p>To use one of the terms that Williams would define and render
useful, Williams had the advantage of an &#8216;alignment&#8217; determined
by his birth into a working-class family as the son of a railway
signalman in Pandy, a village in Wales. He was five years old when
the general strike &#8220;was bitterly fought out on a small scale in the
village&#8221; (Williams, <strong>Politics and Letters</strong>, p.&nbsp;27).
Williams was the precocious scholarship boy who occasionally appears
in such communities, and he won a place at Cambridge, where he &#8220;met
only one other person from a working-class family&#8221; (<strong>Politics and
Letters</strong>, p.&nbsp;40), and understood immediately that the narrow
&#8216;culture&#8217; that his education was based on excluded most of the
whole way of life into which he was born. As one of his early essays
put it, culture is &#8216;ordinary&#8217;; it is how people live.</p>
<p>Despite what appears on the school syllabus, culture is not made
up of specimens of the artistic expression by which a ruling class
has over the centuries revealed its emotions. Matthew Arnold&#8217;s
ideal of culture, &#8220;the best that has been known and said&#8221; &#8211;
still the foundation of most liberal education &#8211; not only excluded
the experience of ordinary people but understood the world in ways
foreign to all not within a narrow class-based fraternity.</p>
<p>To become conscious of one&#8217;s alignment, as Williams did in
encountering the educational system of the ruling class, is to move
to &#8216;commitment&#8217;. For that reason. Williams&#8217;s life was also,
throughout, a committed political life. Given the circumstances that
socialists faced in the long night of Stalinism, Williams had to
search for a way forward to a non-bureaucratic and democratic but
still revolutionary socialism and this he did in a life-long quest
that moved forward along with his search for the authentic
intellectual contribution of Marx.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fst">COMING FROM A community in which the Communist Party had
traditional roots, he joined the CP while at Cambridge but drifted
away during the war years (during which he saw active service) to
re-emerge in the post-war socialist movement as one of the founding
figures of the New Left and the primary author of the 1967 <strong>May Day
Manifesto</strong>.</p>
<p>Williams was always impatient with reformists and careerists: in
his contribution to <strong>The Forward March of Labour Halted?</strong> in
1981, for example, he called for a Labour Party not content to settle
for small gains within capitalism but showing a full programmatic
commitment to socialism.</p>
<p>In a 1977 interview, Williams admitted that he had suffered from
&#8220;a generational block&#8221; (<strong>Politics and Letters</strong>, p.&nbsp;402)
that kept him from exploring Trotsky&#8217;s contribution to
revolutionary theory, but he accepted his interviewer&#8217;s statement
that a &#8220;grasp of this social process through which a new political
order comes into existence was the deep insight, the great legacy of
Trotsky&#8217;s thought&#8221; (p.&nbsp;399).</p>
<p>No doubt, Williams&#8217;s brief involvement with the Communist Party
left him with a distorted view of Trotsky that he found hard to shake
off. Still, as Terry Eagleton came to recognize, &#8220;A striking
feature of Williams&#8217;s career is that he moves steadily farther to
the political left, in a welcome reversal of the usual clich&eacute;d trek
from youthful radical to middle-aged reactionary&#8221; (Eagleton,
obituary for Williams in <strong>New Left Review</strong>, 1988).</p>
<p>When Williams found apparent contradictions or ambiguities in
Marxist texts, he never hesitated to say so, and, for a time,
resisted the label &#8216;Marxist&#8217;. In his <strong>Culture and Society</strong>
(1958), he looks at the controversy that once raged over the question
of whether the critic Christopher Caudwell produced pseudo-science or
a Marxist aesthetics and declares that as &#8220;one who is not a
Marxist&#8221;, it is not for him to decide. Nonetheless, and
characteristically, even though he in that early but important book
declares Marxist explanations of concepts like &#8216;base&#8217; and
&#8216;superstructure&#8217; to be inadequate formulations, he would spend
almost twenty years in rethinking that relationship so that he could,
as a Marxist, explain it in a more materialist &#8211; more Marxist &#8211; way.</p>
<p>This long struggle for a truly Marxist approach to literature and
culture finally resulted in the landmark book, <strong>Marxism and
Literature</strong>, in 1977. By this time, Williams&#8217;s thinking had been
so refreshed and clarified by an immersion in Marx, and his lifelong
alignment and commitment so fully confirmed in the
economic-political-historical totality that he now grasped through
Marxism, that he does not hesitate to announce himself a Marxist and
his approach to literature that of a &#8216;cultural materialist&#8217;.
<strong>Marxism and Literature</strong>, itself now twenty years old, must
stand as the central book in Williams&#8217;s career, and the one that
revivified Marxist criticism and assigned it new tasks.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fst">THE BOOK PROCEEDS by examining key concepts that were distorted by
previous Marxist critics. At the same time, it exposes the inadequacy
of bourgeois formulations about literature and casts profound doubt
over the value of such commonplace categories as &#8216;genre&#8217; and
about usual understandings of the nature of the &#8216;author&#8217;.
Literature had long been classified, pointlessly and inconsistently,
within a narrow range of &#8216;genres&#8217; or types &#8211; such as novel,
epic, or lyric &#8211; but such categories ignore both developments as
society changes and the innovative drive that humans display. As for
&#8216;authors&#8217;, there is, as with all others who perform labour within
a society and economic system, great variation in social role,
consciousness, and degree of independence.</p>
<p>For a book of clarification, <strong>Marxism and Literature</strong> is
demanding reading in that it must struggle very hard indeed to draw
out seemingly small distinctions &#8211; reproducing, as it were,
Williams&#8217;s own lifelong struggle with Marxism and literature. It
furthermore suffers from a paucity of examples: Williams explains
that the format of the series of Oxford introductions for which the
book was written severely restricted the number of pages at his
disposal. In his many books and articles, Williams&#8217;s writing is
remarkably free of the jargon that has infested criticism in recent
decades, but here the language strikes most readers as abstract and
unfamiliar. Yet, despite its problems, <strong>Marxism and Literature</strong>
remains a book that in its 218 packed pages allows Marxist criticism
and Marxism itself to lurch forward significantly.</p>
<p>&#8216;Culture&#8217;, which most accurately refers to a &#8216;whole way of
life&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;culture&#8217; in the sense in which anthropologists use
the word &#8211; is always something made by humans. Marx developed the
idea that humans make their own world by showing that making a
culture is also material, social production &#8211; labour. Many
Marxists, however &#8211; unlike Marx himself &#8211; failed to grasp that
ideology, the production of ideas, is itself material and social.
Marx used the metaphor of &#8216;base&#8217; and &#8216;superstructure&#8217;
(&#8216;<em>&Uuml;berbau</em>&#8217;), and Marxist critics and others took this
relationship in terms of a quite un-Marxist separation of material
and intellectual realms. (For a Marxist, &#8216;social being determines consciousness&#8217;).</p>
<p>To begin to demonstrate that cultural activity is material
production, Williams turns to &#8216;language&#8217; and deplores the
reliance of literary criticism on inadequate linguistic theory like
that of Ferdinand de Saussure. Marx understood that language is an
integral part of human self-creation: even if human identity is
socially and materially determined, it is verbally constituted.
Language, according to Marx, is &#8216;practical consciousness&#8217;;
language is material (&#8216;agitated layers of air&#8217;, as Marx puts it) and social.</p>
<p>Language use is productive activity arising from , as Williams
puts it, &#8220;continuing speech-activity between real individuals who
are in some continuing social relationship&#8221;. There is a &#8220;continuing
development of a language&#8221;, as opposed to Saussure&#8217;s reliance on
&#8216;past product&#8217;. &#8220;Material reality&#8221;, Williams says, is grasped
&#8220;through language, which as practical consciousness is saturated by
and saturates all social activity, including productive activity&#8221;
(p.&nbsp;37). The label &#8216;literature&#8217; was historically limited to
certain works selected by a ruling class from certain imaginative &#8211;
generally old &#8211; texts, but &#8216;literature&#8217; more accurately
includes all kinds of linguistic work: &#8220;Literature&#8221;, Williams
says, &#8220;is the process and the result of formal composition within
the social and formal properties of a language&#8221; (p.&nbsp;46).</p>
<p>If, for the most part, Williams finds classic Marxist formulations
about language and the production of intellectual products more
useful than subsequent efforts, he does not hesitate to accept
Antonio Gramsci&#8217;s specialization of the term &#8216;hegemony&#8217; to
describe the way that the ruling class moulds the consciousness of
those that it rules. He finds this word more useful than
&#8216;superstructure&#8217; or &#8216;ideology&#8217; to describe those &#8216;ruling
ideas of each age&#8217;, which Marx recognizes, &#8216;have ever been the
ideas of its ruling class&#8217; and thus come to be mistaken for reality
even by those who are ruled. Within a particular hegemony, one may
distinguish tradition (always selective), institutions (particularly
in education and communications, largely what Althusser calls &#8216;the
state ideological apparatus&#8217;), and formations (i.e. self-conscious
intellectual or artistic movements).</p>
<p>Elements in a culture or a specific cultural product, like a piece
of literature, that are Dominant, Residual, or Emergent, may usefully
be distinguished. The Residual, which is made up of attitudes left
over from classical or feudal times, can on occasion be
counter-hegemonic in harking back to pre-capitalist values, as in the
Christian ideal of brotherhood set up against modern competition.</p>
<p>The Emergent is likely to arise on a class foundation from an area
of cultural production neglected by the hegemonic: until trends in
rock music are incorporated into the profit system, they are often
both protest and a vision of new social relationships. Their
emergence is of course often stifled by the Dominant &#8211; which is the
shared understanding of life under capitalism that celebrates
competition rather than community.</p>
<p>Within structures of feeling (a favourite Williams phrase
throughout his writings) found in literature and in other cultural
production, even &#8216;Pre-emergent&#8217; elements can be grasped.
Structures of feeling are themselves social experience but often
mistaken for personal experience and are felt long before fully
articulated. Williams offers no examples, but the various phases of
British youth culture over the last fifty years would, perhaps, be
full of examples of structures of feeling that are &#8216;Pre-emergent&#8217;
but social in origin and in search of cultural articulation over
against the hegemonic. Punk music and body-piercing are two recent
instances of &#8216;Pre-emergent&#8217; resistance to the hegemonic.</p>
<p>The &#8216;aesthetic&#8217; experience is an item of consumption within
bourgeois economics. What has been sought in the aesthetic in the
bourgeois period are the human values that capitalism excludes.
Aesthetic experiences are real, indeed at times quite physical, but
occur in specific social and historical circumstances and not on an
ideal plane or with meanings in other cultures or at other times.
Crises in technique have occurred in periods of crisis in the
relationship between art and society, so &#8216;forms&#8217;, which are
themselves modes of social relationship, become unstable in periods
of social change.</p>
<p>The Emergent can, remarkably enough, often be seen in the form of
a literary work even before it is seen in content. (We can begin to
grasp what Williams means by this emphasis on form by realizing that
the new &#8216;message&#8217; of rock-and-roll was grasped by youth culture
before it could be articulated. Similarly, the disintegration of
traditional forms in the novel has arisen alongside a feeling of
dissolution in bourgeois culture that is still more an anxiety than a statement).</p>
<p>As for &#8216;Alignment and Commitment&#8217;, all writing is aligned in
that it arises from a position within social relationships, but
committed writing is conscious of this alignment or comes from a
change of alignment. Finally, summing up, Williams argues that
literary production is a social and material self-composition in
which at times the hegemonic may be confronted &#8220;in the fibres of the self&#8221;.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="fst">OUT OF WHAT appears to be an unwillingness to adopt language
crudely applied by some Stalinist critics, Williams does
unfortunately seem in <strong>Marxism and Literature</strong> to miss some
opportunities to link literary production and other forms of cultural
production with the general labour process. He notes that the word
&#8220;&#8216;labour&#8217; ... was more and more narrowly conceived&#8221;, so that
it did not cover &#8220;the whole material process&#8221; (p.&nbsp;33), but
only certain kinds of work. But surely Williams should not then avoid
the unifying word &#8216;labour&#8217; but should insist that it be broadened
to its full Marxist meaning, in which it encompasses all human
efforts to change the world.</p>
<p>As Williams himself points out:</p>
<p class="quoteb">&#8220;&#8216;Consciousness and its products&#8217; are always,
though in variable forms, parts of the material social process
itself: whether as what Marx called the necessary element of
&#8216;imagination&#8217; in the labour process; or as the necessary
conditions of associated labour, in language and in practical ideas
of relationship; or, which is so often and significantly forgotten,
in the real processes &#8211; all of them physical and material, most of
them manifestly so &#8211; which are masked and idealized as
&#8216;consciousness and its products&#8217; but which, when seen without
illusions, are themselves necessarily social material activities.&#8221;
(pp.&nbsp;61&#8211;62)</p>
<p class="fst">Labour, in fact, represents a linking of mental and material
processes, but when labour is alienated, as it has been ever since
the simultaneous emergence of private property and the division of
labour, the result is ideology, which Marx and Engels call
&#8216;self-dependent theory&#8217; or &#8216;false consciousness&#8217;.</p>
<p>If Williams boldly asserted the inclusion of all social material
process under the word &#8216;labour&#8217;, a unity not missed by Marx and
Engels, he would make it much more evident that literary and cultural
production, its products as well as its processes, may be analysed in
the same terms as other kinds of labour. Humanity itself is divided
in the division of labour (as Engels argued), so it is at best a
damaged human being reaching after completeness who has made the
literary product. All the limits and pressures of the writer &#8216;s
social existence are reflected in the writer and the literary
product. The realm of the aesthetic as an escape from the harsh
realities of capitalism is the false consciousness that believes it
is &#8220;in a position to emancipate itself from the world&#8221; (Marx and
Engels, <strong>German Ideology</strong>). Williams risks maintaining the
separation of &#8216;mental&#8217; and &#8216;material&#8217; labour that both he and
Marx warn against. All human productivity is precisely &#8216;labour&#8217;
and must be called that even if other Marxists, especially in the
1930s, had too narrow a view of what the word meant.</p>
<p>The achievement of <strong>Marxism and Literature</strong> is, in fact, to
return to Marx to demonstrate that the production of literature &#8211;
and all other cultural production &#8211; is the creation of a material
social process. All creative work is part of the labour process by
which humans, in the defining activity of the species, change the
world. All labour is part of an effort to create a more human world.</p>
<p>When the labour expended is alienated labour, the distortions of
such alienation is evident in the product, whether that product is a
sonnet or a skyscraper. But all work, literature included, reaches
for a full humanity. The work Marxists are called to perform
addresses the ultimate human goal most directly because the labour
that Marxists undertake is the building of socialism. To this
ultimate task, Raymond Williams, from the unexpected vantage point of
the study of literature, helps us to understand how human labour
contains a yearning within it that is part of the historical movement
toward world-wide socialism.</p>
