<p class="fst"><strong>Working-class Fiction: From Chartism to <em>Trainspotting</em></strong><br/>
by Ian Haywood<br/>
<em>Northcote House (in association with the British Council), 1998, &#0163;8.99</em></p>
<p class="fst">WHEN I MENTIONED to a fellow Socialist at a meeting in London that
I was teaching a course in working-class fiction, he replied that he
hoped that I would tell the students about working-class reality too.</p>
<p>One of the many strengths of Ian Haywood&#8217;s <strong>Working-class
Fiction</strong> is that it does keep working-class reality very much in
view. In the front of the book there is a five page chronology of
events in working-class and socialist history that also keeps an eye
on economic developments as well.</p>
<p>In fulfillment of Ian Haywood&#8217;s conviction that &#8220;the most
productive context for enjoying and interpreting working-class
fiction is within a labour movement and political tradition&#8221;, each
chapter opens with detailed discussion of the phase in the history of
British labour struggle which produced the fiction that he will examine.</p>
<p>To say, however, that working-class reality needs first to be
acknowledged, does make one wonder why that reality should be
rendered as fiction at all, particularly when the novel is defined by
bourgeois conventions. As Haywood notes, by the time working-class
people started to write fiction, &#8220;the British novel was deeply
biased against reflecting a working-class perspective on society&#8221;.
The Chartist novelist Thomas Cooper &#8220;understood that
nineteenth-century realism reflected a bourgeois view of the world,
with property and marriage the driving force of most storylines&#8221;.
If D.H. Lawrence in <strong>Sons and Lovers</strong> does not need to expand
the conventions of the novel to include industrial struggle and
solidarity it is because his novel is written to say good-bye to
working-class origins, and affirm, as Haywood says, &#8220;bourgeois
individualism&#8221; (p.&nbsp;21).</p>
<p>On the other hand, Robert Tressell in <strong>The Ragged-Trousered
Philanthropists</strong> must re-invent the novel so that it will be about
a class as well as an individual, depict actual work, and incorporate
teaching chapters about socialism. When a novel reaches a
working-class readership as successfully as Tressell&#8217;s did, it
becomes an interpretation of reality that can begin to change it.</p>
<p>Working-class fiction can then fill an important role by
contesting ruling-class notions about what does constitute reality.
Education in Britain, including of course the education provided for
the working-class, has been and remains predominantly a literary
education &#8211; not the Greek and Latin classics that were once the
rites of passage for ruling class youth, but &#8216;English Literature&#8217;.</p>
<p>Reading, including the reading of fiction, has been an avenue to
truth approved by the dominant class in society ever since the
English Revolution (when the Puritans insisted that the Bible be
available to all). Socialists, including especially socialist
teachers, have a special obligation to see that books depicting
working-class life are read. It is encouraging that Barry Hines&#8217;s
<strong>Kestrel for a Knave</strong>, a book that Haywood writes well about, is
now among the most read books in schools. Similarly, it is gratifying
to see that Haywood&#8217;s book is part of the <em>Writers and Their Work</em>
series that has the support of the British Council behind it.</p>
<p>If working-class fiction demands that work itself be acknowledged
&#8211; as it is not in, for instance, a Jane Austen novel &#8211; that can
only be done if the characteristic work-related moments in the lives
of ordinary people are described.</p>
<p>Haywood identifies the scenes that occur again and again in novels
over the decades &#8211; the first day at work, in the factory or down
the pit; then the routine of rising early to go to work, &#8216;proletarian
dawn&#8217;, as Haywood names it &#8211; as well as strikes, periods of
unemployment, and accidents at work. If education is based on books
denying these realities, it is productive of illusions about life
under capitalism.</p>
<p>The reality captured by working-class fiction can of course make
the ruling classes uncomfortable. For instance, the British
government refused to allow a film version of Walter Greenwood&#8217;s
1933 novel <strong>Love on the Dole</strong> until 1941.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Communist Party of Great Britain was similarly
aware of the potential power of working-class fiction and encouraged
its production &#8211; while opposing modernist experimentation and
holding party authors to support of the party line. Novels could be
critical of the non-Communist leadership of working-class
organizations in the ultra-left &#8216;class-against-class&#8217; period,
before the change to a popular front policy at the Seventh Congress
of the Communist International in 1935, but not afterwards.</p>
<p>Haywood has done an outstanding job of finding the working-class
novels of all periods, most of which are unfortunately out-of-print.
It is extremely valuable for future work to know, for instance, which
novels to read for scenes from the General Strike of 1926.</p>
<p>Readers will differ in their estimation of the individual novels.
I find Lewis Jones&#8217;s <strong>We Live</strong> (1939) a novel of lasting power
even if not perfectly executed. The claustrophobic descriptions of
the underground life in the dark for miners during a stay-down
strike; the exultant moment when the women take more militant action
against the local council than the men had envisioned; Mary&#8217;s
assumption of the leadership in party work; the exhilaration of
demonstrations and marches &#8211; all these are scenes that can still
inspire activists. That the hero dies in Spain in service of
Stalinist efforts to prevent revolution adds a historical irony which
is rendered tragic by the knowledge that Jones also died in the year
of the novel&#8217;s publication, because of his work for Spain.</p>
<p>Haywood makes a convincing case for <strong>Room at the Top</strong> as one
of the important novels of the post-war boom period, alongside the
customary <strong>Saturday Night and Sunday Morning</strong>. Pat Barker&#8217;s
<strong>Union Street</strong>, a book about the shared identity that women
feel, gains additional depth from being brought into the tradition
that Haywood studies. There are, however, so many important &#8211; and
generally neglected &#8211; authors that Haywood discusses in his short
book of only 178 pages, that a brief review can only name a few other
authors, about whom Haywood&#8217;s book must be consulted, that is
(alphabetically): Stan Barstow, Walter Brierley, Sid Chaplin, Allen
Clarke, Len Doherty, Nell Dunn, Buchi Emecheta, Lewis Grassic Gibbon,
James Hanley, Margaret Harkness, Harold Heslop, David Storey, Ellen Wilkinson.</p>
<p><strong>Trainspotting</strong>, Irvine Welsh&#8217;s picture of urban youth in
the 1990s, rounds out this history. Its success in the cinema serves
to remind us that in this century film has often successfully
challenged the privileged interpretative function previously granted
to print. Since <em>Love on the Dole</em> &#8211; once permission for
shooting was finally granted &#8211; working-class films have, both as
adaptations of novels like <em>Kes</em> or <em>Saturday Night and Sunday
Morning</em>, or in the original work of directors like Ken Loach,
brought new resources to the depiction of what is, after all, the
class struggle and the prime agent of history.</p>
