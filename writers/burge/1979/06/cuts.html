<h4>Health Cuts:</h4>

<h1>Unions Must Lead the Fight Back</h1>

<h3>(June 1979)</h3>

<p class="fst"><strong>Despite Tory Chancellor Geoffrey Howe&#8217;s promise that health
spending levels would be maintained, the NHS is faced with massive
cuts even without any further reductions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This is due to erosion of cash limits by inflation, new VAT
rates and wage awards. Millions of pounds are being wiped off Health
Authority spending. This means tens of thousands of jobs at risk,
together with the services they provide.</strong></p>

<p>Area Health Authorities talk for the first time of redundancies
rather than &#8216;natural wastage&#8217;.</p>

<p>Redundancies! When there is already a huge shortage of staff in
the NHS, including 70,000 nurses. When we have a waiting list over
half a million!</p>

<p>The horrors of the situation came home at last to members of the
City and East London AHA(T) at their recent meeting. Before them was
the stark reality of at least &#163;10m shortfall in funds; and proposals
drawn up to make savings. These have already been detailed in
<strong>Militant</strong> (June 1st).</p>

<p>Tory members on the Authority said &#8216;Be realistic &#8211; accept
there is no more money.&#8217; Labour members, however, were beginning to
get the message from hospital unions and the local community.</p>
<p>One member nominated by the local authority proposed that more
money be demanded and that meantime the Authority maintains existing
levels of service and establishments.</p>

<p>All Labour members spoke in support. Their point was that they had
been party to enough cuts in the past, that there seemed to be no end
in sight, that promised improvements had not materialised, and now
was the time to take a stand.</p>

<p>The Chairman (Mr Cumberlege, tea broker) gave his usual lecture.
Allocations were decided by the democratically elected government. If
the Authority overspent it would only have to be paid next year, with
even more drastic cuts, etc.</p>

<p>An amendment was moved to completely water down the motion,
calling for yet another cap in hand delegation to the Regional Health
Authority. The amendment was passed with members from Labour local
authorities being outvoted.</p>

<p>One such member immediately resigned, stating he now had no
alternative to conducting opposition outside. Unfortunately this was
only a personal gesture. Other Labour members and the trade nominee
remained seated to continue the charade of democracy.</p>

<p>This performance demonstrates our weakness on these Authorities.
Members tend to ignore their Labour Parties and trade unions, feeling
they know best. A determined opposition, an ultimatum followed by a
&#8216;mass&#8217; resignation would have had tremendous effect.</p>

<p>The Tory rump would have been left to carry on, with Labour
completely disassociated from any further carve-up of the NHS. This
would have been tremendously encouraging to hospital staff and trade
unionists campaigning against cuts.</p>

<p>It would have restored some credibility to the Labour Party, and
made it easier to convince NHS trade unionists to take up the
political struggle inside the Labour Party.</p>

<p>Already the Tories had begun to show hesitancy. The chairman and
members were unwilling too hastily to rubber-stamp the proposals,
postponing decisions and asking management to produce alternatives.</p>

<p>Management expressed frustration, complaining that they were told
not to overspend, yet proposals for savings were not accepted.</p>

<p>But due to the uncertainty, staff will inevitably be tempted to
seek jobs elsewhere. In this way the run-down commences. The trade
unions need to adopt a much firmer position, one that will allay
fears of staff and give them confidence they can win.</p>

<p>Despite the shortcomings, these developments must be welcomed. The
changing attitudes of some Labour councillors on the Health
Authorities and the prevarication of top administrators reflect
pressure building up in the movement.</p>

<p>The leadership of our organisations must take note of this, and
begin to mobilise the ranks of the trade unions and Labour Parties.
If these leaders ignore the decisions and demands of our movement
they must be replaced by those prepared to take up the challenge.</p>

<p>Our movement&#8217;s enormous power once installed the NHS. It must
now be gathered to replace the Tory government by a Labour government
thoroughly committed to change in society ...</p>

<p>The only way to combat the poverty and conditions which cause
widespread bad health is by eradicating those conditions. This
requires a programme to provide jobs at decent wages for all, to
provide decent housing, schools, and decent, safe working and living
conditions.</p>

<p>Such a programme requires a complete change of course by the next
Labour government. It needs a programme for socialism.</p>
