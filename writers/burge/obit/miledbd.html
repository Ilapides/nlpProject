<p class="fst">The labour movement suffered a tragic loss on Sunday 18th May,
with the premature death of Ian Burge.</p>

<p>Regular readers of <strong>Militant</strong> would best remember Ian for his
excellent contributions on the National Health Service, in which he
worked and was an active trade unionist.</p>

<p>Ian&#8217;s powers of research were second to none and gave fresh
material and new ideas to the movement on the battle against cuts in
the Health Service.</p>

<p>Apart from many articles in the paper, Ian was the author of
several widely read <strong>Militant</strong> pamphlets: <strong>A Socialist
Programme to Save the NHS</strong> [1977], <strong>Should Nurses Go On Strike?</strong>
[1979], and recently the excellent <strong>Stop the Cuts: Defend the NHS!</strong>
[1979]. He also wrote a pamphlet putting the case for workers&#8217;
control and management in the NHS, <strong>Patients First &#8211; Or Cuts
First?</strong>, produced only a few weeks ago by Tower Hamlets Health
District JSS Committee.</p>

<p>In Ian&#8217;s own words, however &#8220;the fight against the cuts is not
enough. Bad health is endemic in the society we at present live in
and only the socialist transformation of society can provide the
conditions for the prevention of ill health.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not only a prolific writer for better healthcare and socialist
change, Ian was a tireless fighter both in the Labour Party and, as a
member of ASTMS, in the hospital unions. At the London Hospital,
where he worked, he was secretary of the Joint Shop Stewards&#8217;
Committee, a body he helped to form.</p>

<p>He gave unceasing leadership in the movement in the East End of
London to defend the Health Service from attacks and closures, and
played a prominent part in the battle to save Bethnal Green hospital
as a general hospital meeting the needs of the local population.</p>

<p>When called on, Ian also gave valuable advice on many occasions to
trade-union activists in the NHS in many other areas of the country.</p>

<p>As a member of the North West Essex Health Board, he unflinchingly
gave a lead in heading off the attacks on hospitals in the Harlow area.</p>

<p>Ian first settled in Harlow with his wife Barbara and twin
daughters in 1969, and rapidly involved himself in pioneering the
influence of <strong>Militant</strong> in the Harlow area and the Eastern
Region as a whole. His family, to which Ian was devoted, was added to
by the birth of another daughter, Nancy.</p>

<p>Ian quickly established himself in the Old Harlow Labour Party
branch, where he became chairman in the &#8217;70s. His well informed
contributions to Harlow CLP&#8217;s General Committee meeting were always
listened to intently. When Ian was on his feet, the GMC knew that
important points and facts were being put forward.</p>

<p>Ian&#8217;s flair for new ideas and concepts were not restricted to
the health field. He pioneered the use of film slides in informative
talks, and made these, and his copious notes, available to any
section of the labour movement.</p>

<p>Meticulous attention to detail made him outstanding as an
organiser of paper sales. All sellers of <strong>Militant</strong> in Harlow
from the early &#8217;70s had their minds focused on careful accounting
for papers. The testament to Ian&#8217;s work is that sales of <strong>Militant</strong>
in Harlow rate amongst the best in the country.</p>

<p>His death is a great loss to all who knew him as a comrade, and
especially to those who also knew him as a friend. He was friendly
and patient with people, often showing his sense of humour, very
rarely angry. Ian&#8217;s approach was always gentle and generous.</p>
<p>Ian&#8217;s political achievements will live on and we will be
building on them. Remember Ian&#8217;s own words: &#8220;Capitalism kills.
Fight for a socialist world!&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>The <em>Militant</em> Editorial Board sends its sincere
condolences to his wife, friends and family.</strong></p>
