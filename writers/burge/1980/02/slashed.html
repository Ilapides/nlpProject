<p class="fst"><strong>Faced with a growing movement of opposition to their cuts
policies, the Tories have tried unsuccessfully, to put out minds at
rest about the future of the health service.</strong></p>

<p><strong>They have denied that they are cutting back on NHS spending.
True, they admit that last June&#8217;s VAT increase has cost the NHS &#163;40
millions during 1979. They concede that inflation above the 8&#189;%
level at which they started off in power has cost the NHS a further
&#163;60 millions.</strong></p>

<p>But they have promised that future spending levels will take
account of these increases. Managements have used this argument,
claiming the cuts are only of a temporary nature, and that spending
levels will be restored next April.</p>

<p>The Tories also claim that they are maintaining the levels of
health spending as planned by the last Labour government, that is of
a modest growth in real terms.</p>

<p>Publication of the Public expenditure White Paper, and the
statements of Patrick Jenkin, Secretary of State for Health and
Social Services, shatter these arguments. They show that behind the
fine words lie further cuts.</p>

<p>Governments accept that the NHS requires 1% to 2% growth per year
in spending, merely to stand still. This is nothing to do with
inflation. Costs are rising due to the changing population structure
and to the introduction of new drugs and new medical techniques.</p>

<p>The 3% &#8216;growth&#8217; announced for the year 1980/81 merely covers
this expected increased requirement over the two year period since
1978/79.</p>

<p>Patrick Jenkin stated in Parliament, however, that 2&#189;% of this 3%
would be to make up the losses imposed by cash limits on this year&#8217;s
NHS spending, leaving only &#189;% left for the inevitable 2% to 4%
actual increased costs. It is clear that already we are faced with a
continuation of this year&#8217;s drastic cuts.</p>

<p>Based on an expected 11&#189;% inflation, rather than the 8&#189;%
originally allowed for by Labour, the current year&#8217;s NHS cuts have
been estimated at &#163;125 million, including &#163;25 million towards the
costs of wage increases. As yet we don&#8217;t know how wage awards will
be funded next year. But already inflation is running over 17%, so
the cut this year will be even greater than so far officially acknowledged.</p>

<p>As shown above, this will effectively be carried forward next year
as a permanent cut.</p>

<p>Whichever way you look at it, it is going to be in the region of
&#163;200 millions (and probably more) out of a total figure of
approximately &#163;9,000 millions, this would be roughly the equivalent
of say, closing 100 medium size hospitals.</p>

<p>It would involve upwards of 40,000 jobs, and affect maybe 200,000
or 400,000 in-patients per year for whom no beds will be available.</p>

<p>It is not possible to work out the <i>exact</i> implications of
the Tories&#8217; policies in terms of future cuts without the actual
cash limits figure, yet to be allocated, and the assumptions on which
it is based.</p>

<p>If the allocations underestimate the inflation rate, the situation
will be even worse, with health authorities attempting to make huge
panic &#8216;savings&#8217;. Yet already as the end of the current financial
year approaches many Districts and Areas will be overspent and hoping
for an easier time next year.</p>

<p>One final point should be borne in mind. What will be &#8220;restored&#8221;
by the government? It is only spending levels which can be restored,
and there is grave doubt about whether this will be done.</p>

<p>But there is no way in which health will be restored to those who
have had to forego treatment because of the cutbacks. No Tory magic
can restore life to those who died because of NHS cuts.</p>

<p>These effects of cutbacks are permanent. Waiting lists go up &#8211;
and they stay up.</p>
