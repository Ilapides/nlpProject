<h1>&#8216;Democracy Is Interference&#8217;</h1>

<h4>Say Tories</h4>

<h3>(February 1980)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Militant</strong>, No.&nbsp;490, 15 February 1980, p.&nbsp;7.<br />
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<br />
<p class="fst"><strong>&#8220;Patients first&#8221; is about the last title most people would
choose for any proposals from this barbarous Tory government on the
National Health Service.</strong></p>

<p><strong>But this name is cynically given to the recent Tory proposals
on the restructuring of the NHS. The Tories&#8217; real attitude is of
course, one of &#8220;working class patients last &#8211; first priority to
the rich and big business interests.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>Fighting to prevent closures, you can&#8217;t help noticing that the
NHS is being run on ever more strict &#8216;business&#8217; lines. Small
cliques make the real decisions behind the scenes, and Health
Authority members are treated as rubber stamps.</p>

<p>Some Labour members on the health authorities have criticised the
cuts and some authorities, particularly when pressurised by local
campaigns have delayed some of the worst closures. Ultimately though,
the accountants get their way and trade unionists in the NHS and the
working class who use the services have no say.</p>

<p>The Tories have raised objections, though, even to the minimal
hold-ups caused by pressure from AHAs and Community Health Councils.</p>

<p>Patrick Jenkin told <strong>Conservative News</strong> that he believed one
potent source of delay and waste was the huge amount of consultation
required. He wants &#8220;normal day to day decisions&#8221; (such as closing
wards, maybe?) to be taken by &#8220;the people actually running the show.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Tory proposals are that the present multi-district Area Health
Authorities should disappear. In their place a larger number of
smaller District Health Authorities.</p>

<p>The proportion of councillors serving on authorities is to be
reduced. Other members are to be chosen for &#8216;personal qualities&#8217;,
and certainly not to be elected and accountable. These appointments
are to be made by the Regional Health Authorities, themselves
possibly in the future to be made up of ... District Authority nominees!</p>

<p>The management at District level is to be enlarged, and the
grading of hospital administrators is to be raised to reflect the
&#8216;maximum delegation of responsibility&#8217;.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&#8220;Savings&#8221;</h4>

<p class="fst">The Tories claim that &#8216;eventually&#8217; the re-structuring will
lead to a saving of 10% on management costs (equivalent to about
&#163;30m). This saving will not come from top managers. The new district
authorities will need even more of these. It can only be from the
area headquarters staff that any &#8216;savings&#8217; will be made &#8211; thus
threatening thousands of jobs of clerical and ancillary staff.</p>

<p>One bad system is to be replaced by another. We must remember what
the Tories&#8217; overall aims are for the NHS &#8211; to make it a vehicle
for exploitation by private interests, to reduce services and to
teach people to make less use of the NHS (as <strong>The Times</strong>
succinctly put it). They want cuts implemented and they don&#8217;t want
anyone interfering.</p>

<p>Trades Councils, health union branches, and Labour Parties will
now be considering the Tory proposals. The labour and trade union
movement should reject them.</p>

<p>We should demand that health service government bodies should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be 100% committed to defending the principles of the NHS<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Be elected, accountable, and subject to recall<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Contain a built-in majority from the trade unions<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Contain representatives from the service and through the
health trade unions</li>
</ul>

<p class="fst">Participation of Labour Councillors and trade union/Trade Council
nominees in any future local authorities, set up on the lines of the
Tory proposals, is a matter of tactics, as it is indeed with the
present structure.</p>

<p>Their role must clearly be to oppose all cuts. They should work
together, and with the local sections of the labour and trade union
movement, to expose the plans and publicly campaign against the cuts.</p>

<p>But there can be no argument for a lone voice in the wilderness.
In the absence of an organised and effective opposition, members
serving on such authorities will inevitably be tacitly supporting the
cuts. In these circumstances they should withdraw or be withdrawn.</p>

<ul>
<li/>
<p><strong>No cuts in services!</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>No redundancies!</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>No closures!</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>For democratic workers&#8217; management and control of the NHS!</strong></li>
</ul>
