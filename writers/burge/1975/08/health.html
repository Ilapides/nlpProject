<h1>Crisis in Health Service</h1>

<h3>(August 1975)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Militant</strong>, No.&nbsp;268, 29 August 1975, p.&nbsp;3.<br />
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">Shop stewards in the Health Service are taking up the challenge of
Big Business which wants to see the Health Service reduced to a
skeleton to pay for the crisis in the economy. In the East End of
London, district wide joint shop stewards&#8217; committees are being
formed for the first time and NUPE with the largest membership is
leading the campaign.</p>

<p>Under planning procedures laid down by the Department of Health
under the Labour Government, Health Authorities must now publish
their plans for consultation with Community Health Councils, Local
Advisory Committees, Local Authorities, Health Service Professional
groups and the Unions. It is this &#8216;opening of the books&#8217; that is
in fact revealing for the first time to the workers the extent of the
cuts to come arising from past and present economies.</p>

<p>This is bad enough, but what of the further drastic cuts to come
and as yet unpublished by the Government? At present the management
are avoiding referring to redundancies, but this is certainly what is
in store for us.</p>

<p>The plans so far seen are the living evidence of Area Health
Authorities and District Management desperately trying to prune
services, close hospitals, sell off the land, in order to make ends
meet. The Tower Hamlets District, with a major teaching hospital of
700 beds and nine other hospitals from 20 to 400 beds in size, last
year overspent by &#163;400,000.</p>

<p>The Health Service is just not getting enough funds to maintain
existing levels of service. This District is now unable to replace
worn out equipment. The only way the management see being able to
make &#8216;progress&#8217; is through reduced staff costs. Already,
ancillary staff over retiring age are to be laid off. Already, 109
beds are closed off. Technical staff are being asked to reduce their
establishment so that people who leave are not replaced. If these
measures do not eliminate enough jobs, management will be looking at
more drastic measures. It looks as though about 200 jobs will have to
go just to make good the &#163;400,000 rate of overspending.</p>

<p>The document we have seen also admits to the present total
inadequacy of the Community Services, where establishments are
already one third below DHSS norms and where even these
establishments are only half filled.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Workers&#8217; management</h4>

<p class="fst">A document of the City and Hackney District proposes two hospital
closures, the Eastern and the Metropolitan, together with a vast
reorganisation of other existing hospital services in an attempt to
absorb the workload of these two. A bulletin put out by the NUPE
district stewards points out that these closures will lead to the
loss of some 600 jobs and 520 beds (20% of Hackney hospital beds).</p>
<p>In order to explain to the workers the implications of these
so-called plans, joint union mass meetings are to be called across
the whole area in working hours and a day of action has been declared
provisionally for October 9th.</p>

<p>Many Health Service stewards recognise, however, that defensive
action against the cuts and closures is not enough on its own and
that Health Service workers will need to draw up alternative
policies, particularly in order to win the support of the Trade
Unions and the Labour Parties. Such policies will need to aim at
ending the private profiteering from the sick and also at
democratising the Health Service.</p>

<p>The City businessmen and other appointed &#8216;experts&#8217; who sit
round boardroom tables deciding what sort of Health Service the
workers can have must be replaced by democratically elected bodies.
<strong>Militant</strong>&#8217;s proposals for management bodies in a nationalised
industries made up of a third elected from the workers in the
industry through their unions, a third elected from the TUC and a
third from the Government can be adopted as a <em>practical</em>
alternative to the present structure in the NHS.</p>

<p>The Health Service should be managed at all levels by, say a third
health workers&#8217; elected representatives, a third Government
representatives to guard the interests of a centrally planned NHS and
a third local working class representatives from the Labour and Trade
Union Movement: Trades Councils, Tenants&#8217; Committees, Consumers&#8217;
Committees, Patients Committees and so on.</p>

<p>Such demands can mobilise all sections of the working class in
defence of the Health Service and towards the construction of a true
Socialist Health Service.</p>
