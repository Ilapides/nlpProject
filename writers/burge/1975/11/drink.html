<p class="fst">Dear Comrade</p>

<p class="fst">Such is the surplus of available labour the employing class are
returning to their old habits, especially where the Trade Unions are
weak or the labour force is poorly organised. In Gilbeys&#8217; bottling
factory in Harlow, one clear example was shown. The Customs and
Excise men went through the lockers of the women workers.</p>

<p>In the locker of one well-established long-serving worker they
found a bottle of sherry. The woman concerned had brought it in so
that her workmates could have a birthday drink. The bottle was still
wrapped as it came from the Off-licence.</p>

<p>The woman was pulled into the office and went through an hour and
a half grilling. Where did it come from? Who had a drink from it? Did
she know who had a drink in the factory? Did she know anyone who
pinched a drink from the warehouse? And so on, until the woman was in
such a state she couldn&#8217;t work and had to go home early.</p>

<p>Many of you might say if you were treated in such a way, &#8220;two
fingers to your tin pot job,&#8221; or &#8220;get the union rep. in to return
the favour to the management.&#8221; But now the situation is, walking
out means no job to go to, and in the past the women workers have
been little inspired to build a strong union organisation in the
factory. All section of the class must make sure the organisations
that have been built up to protect the interests of the working class
are brought out of moth-balls and made to work in our interests.</p>
