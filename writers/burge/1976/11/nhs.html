<p class="fst"><strong>Health workers have shown in recent weeks their readiness to
defend the health service against the cuts carried through on behalf
of big business. They have brought to the attention of all workers
the seriousness of the situation. In the coming months they are going
to be faced with the problem of how to actually prevent hospitals
being closed down.</strong></p>

<p>Up to now they have succeeded, by their actions, in winning a stay
of execution while the management consider alternatives, but very
soon now will come the first major closures. The health workers will
need all the support they can get from the labour movement. Within
the NHS itself, the developing campaign is forging new links between
the unions, and making many sections of workers in the health service
far more conscious as shop floor meetings are being held everywhere
to discuss how the cuts can be fought.</p>

<p>On the first day of strikes in London on the 23rd September a
meeting for all stewards in the East End was hastily arranged to
maintain the impetus and discuss further action. Calls were made for
open ended strike action to force the Area Health Authority to change
its plans.</p>

<p>Meetings of shop stewards have been continuing, with the aim of
thrashing out a joint policy on which to campaign. These meetings
have not been without disagreement, and it would be foolish to expect
otherwise, but this does mark the beginning of the breakdown of
barriers between the various unions, and the development of a health
workers organisation capable of challenging the rule of the managements.</p>

<p>There is confusion among the workers as to whom they are fighting.
The Area Health Authority gave the go-ahead for cuts. Local
management has to implement them. The Area Authority claims to be
bound by Regional Authority policies. Regional policies are largely
determined by financial restrictions and DHSS and government policy.</p>

<p>A serious financial crisis is looming in the health service as the
local managements are finding it impossible to implement the full
sweeping cuts necessary to avoid massive overspending. If nothing is
done, East London Areas will be several million in the red by next
April. New budgetary policies have been introduced this year to force
managements to remain within &#8216;cash limits&#8217;. In the past, due to
increasing costs, the authorities have been allowed to over-spend.
Now any money overspent at the end of the year will be taken from
next year&#8217;s allocation.</p>

<p>The main factors in reducing the allocations being made for health
spending are: (a) effects of national cuts in the Health Service
allocation; (b) re-allocation of funds between Regions to provide
more for deprived Regions; (c) re-distribution between the Areas
within Regions; (d) inflation; (e) and a policy of cuts in some
services to pay for the improvements in others.</p>

<p>The only way that spending in grossly deficient services can be
increased is by cutting down on others. The invention of &#8216;norms&#8217;
gives management the justification for the cuts. These norms are not
based on any assessment or measurement of actual health needs, or
existing utilisation of resources, but are more aimed at spreading
out the shortages and deficiencies more widely.</p>

<p>The big stick being waved is that if the books do not balance, if
the overspending is excessive, then the auditors will be sent in, as
they were at Clay Cross.</p>

<p>The reason that managements are finding it impossible to implement
the full cuts are firstly because they are so sweeping and cannot be
done without risk to the patients, and secondly because of the
growing resistance of the health workers. Thousands of jobs have
already been lost over the past year. As one management has put it,
&#8220;any &#8216;fat&#8217; which has existed has, for the most part been taken up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The message is now getting through to the workers that the
un-filled jobs, the extra workloads, are now permanent. Overtime
working has been slashed, and this, together with other losses of
earnings followed &#8216;reviews&#8217; of bonus schemes, added to continued
inflation of prices, fares, and rents, is severely reducing health
workers&#8217; living standards.</p>

<p>The problems of the health service cannot be solved whilst the
government is pre-occupied with meeting the demands of the CBI for
more and more profits before companies will invest. Profits can only
be increased at the workers&#8217; expense. The &#8216;social contract&#8217; has
kept wages down whilst prices have soared. The cuts in public
spending represent a further erosion of living standards through
reduction of the social wage. The great National Health Service and
Welfare State, set up in response to the near revolutionary mood of
the working class, and to its demands for change at the end of the
war, cannot now be supported by the system.</p>

<p>The present policies of the government are doomed to failure. The
Tories, the CBI and international finance are clamouring for more
huge cuts. They will not be happy until our welfare state is
completely dismantled and we have returned to the days of pauperism.</p>

<p>On the question of the NHS, the Labour Party Conference has: 1.
demanded &#8216;the implementation of a massive building programme
particularly in view of the proposed closure of National Health
Service Hospitals in London. 2. demanded &#8216;a minimum wage for 35
hours (tied to the cost of living index) for all National Health
Service workers&#8217; and &#8216;a halt in the systematic reduction of staff
who are vital to the service at all levels&#8217;. 3. called on the
government &#8216;to take urgent steps to totally abolish private
medicine in this country&#8217;. 4. concluded that &#8216;exploitation by
private industry of the sick in our society can only be ended by the
nationalisation of the pharmaceutical industry with compensation to
be paid on the basis of proven need...&#8217; 5. demanded &#8216;an end to
undemocratic control of hospital boards, running the National Health
Service to be in the hands of elected boards comprising of Health
Service workers, trade unionists and the general public&#8217;.</p>

<p>This is the way forward.</p>
