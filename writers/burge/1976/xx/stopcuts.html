<p class="fst"><strong>The East End of London faces vicious cuts in the National
Health Service; Health workers and patients are both threatened. By
all health and social indices the area is one of the worst off in the
country and already has a raw deal as far as the provision of health
facilities is concerned. Many of the hospitals, usually old
workhouses, really deserve tearing down but they do at least provide
something at the moment.</strong></p>

<p>Already, over the past year we have been faced with the problem of
fighting the cuts, and a certain amount of consolidation has been
taking place in our union organisation.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Union Committees</h4>

<p class="fst">One of the basic problems facing hospital workers is that there
are too many unions in the health service, and this does mean
difficulties in getting together a good joint union policy, essential
if the top management is not to be able to play one section off
against another. The best step is to set up a joint shop stewards
committee. There are many good reasons for such a committee to exist
anyway, but if necessary it should initially be formed as a joint
defence committee against cuts.</p>

<p>One of the first jobs of the committee should be to attempt to
compile all the available information on cuts so far made. The
management should be asked what they consider are the minimum
staffing establishments and vacancies, when these figures are not
known. All Health Authorities are now supposed to publish detailed plans.</p>

<p>Unions and stewards ought to be getting copies automatically, but
where this is not done, then the committee should demand copies.
Taken together all the obtainable information should present a fairly
clear picture of where cuts are planned.</p>

<p>But quite apart from any management figures, the shop stewards
should draw up and maintain a list of what they consider are the
staffing needs. We should not just fight the cuts, we should continue
the fight to improve our conditions and the services that we help provide.</p>

<p>A certain confusion exists among some health workers in their
attitude to the cuts.</p>

<p>It is wrong to accept the principle that cuts need to be made. The
truth is that the health service is sadly undermanned, desperately in
need of modern hospitals and funds to replace old equipment. The
health service needs expansion. It is important to resist cuts
completely at every level. If this is not done there will always be
arguments about which staff should go, and which should stay.</p>

<p>For example, a number of stewards at our hospital rightly pointed
out that the growth areas in staff appeared to them mainly in
Administration. Figures available bear this out. But it is wrong to
then argue that admin staff should therefore be cut in preference to
other sections. It is the ordinary clerks and such like that will suffer.</p>

<p>Almost 80% of costs in the health services are wages and salaries,
and jobs are the quickest ways of making savings. As an absolute
minimum, some inter-union committees have demanded that every
&#8220;saving&#8221; is negotiated, but it is better still that such
&#8220;savings&#8221; are rejected out of hand.</p>

<p>The way to build for militant action is by ensuring that all
members are fully informed about the cuts and plans. Bulletins should
be regularly distributed, and plenty of meetings held so that a full
discussion takes place on the shop floor.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Last resort</h4>

<p class="fst">Health workers have always had a responsible attitude to the
patients when involved in industrial action. Only when they have
become desperate will they strike, as a last resort.</p>

<p>If Government policy requires cuts in health services then it is
they who are responsible for any harmful effects on the patients
resulting from the implementation of the cuts. The health workers are
not only acting in their own interest as far as jobs are concerned,
they are also acting for the working class as a whole.</p>

<p>The main point in the recent strikes in London was to bring the
facts before the workers who use the health services and thereby
appeal for their support in the campaign.</p>

<p>Health union branches must bring the facts before the Trades
Councils who should be mobilising the local unions in support and the
Labour Parties who should be bombarding the government with demands
for implementation of conference decisions on health and the
pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<p>The East London health workers have been linking up through area
wide shop stewards meetings. But the organisational difficulty of
bringing together stewards from about 25 different hospitals and
other sections of health services, and nine different unions, are not inconsiderable.</p>

<p>The stewards committees will be faced with problems of organising
local resistance to closures, and occupations have already been
seriously discussed in relation to the Elizabeth Garret Anderson
Hospital and also the Metropolitan Hospital in Hackney.</p>

<p>The main orientation of any such demonstrations must be to get
public support against the closures.</p>

<p>The way forward for the health workers is to campaign in all
sections of the labour movement against the present policies of the
government. A number of demands specific to the health service need
to be taken up, as part of explaining the effects of the cuts, and of
putting forward alternative policies which can be taken up in the movement.</p>
