<h4>*</h4>

<p class="fst">St. Nicholas Hospital, Plumstead, South East London, was once
threatened with closure. Then following a vigorous campaign, David
Ennals (Minister of Health) granted a reprieve. He said, however,
that five other local hospitals might have to close instead. Now the
plans seem to have gone full circle, with a new threat hanging over
the hospital.</p>

<p>The new plan seems to be to reduce the 288-bed general hospital to
an 85-bed &#8216;community&#8217; hospital. The inverted commas are necessary
because &#8216;community&#8217; seems to have become a euphemism for
&#8220;stripped-down&#8221;.</p>

<p>The timetable for the run-down has now been speeded up. The
resignation of one of the two consultants with beds at the hospital
is being used as an excuse. There is to be a general reduction in
staff by about a third, with 95 to 105 less nurses required.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Blackmail</h4>

<p>There are about 80 nursing jobs vacant in the Area, and nurses at
St Nicks are being blackmailed into applying for these before
September 30th or else they will be without jobs. The full
run-down is expected to be complete by next March.</p>

<p>Like all other areas, this one has long waiting lists. There is no
doubt that the beds at St Nicks are urgently needed. Yet management
are to close them down.</p>

<p>One reliable source has revealed a plan to convert the
accommodation into offices for Area Officials &#8211; at a cost of &#163;3&#190; million.</p>
<p>The service which will no doubt be mostly missed is the Accident
and Emergency Department. A large number of local workers depend on
this at the moment should there be any accidents at work, or
travelling to work.</p>

<p>Local industries include a large chemical works and a Ford
factory. These are the places where the hospital unions should be
seeking massive support. It is these workers who will really miss the
services. They are the ones who will suffer when they have to be
taken to the next available unit &#8211; at Greenwich General, about five
miles further away.</p>

<p>The Action Committee at the hospital are now organising a
conference for local stoppages to save the hospital. This is along
similar lines to the campaign presently being organised by Tower
Hamlets shop stewards, with respect to Bethnal Green Hospital and the
cuts in Tower Hamlets.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Campaign</h4>

<p>The TU blacking of conversion work at Bethnal Green Hospital has
meant POEU members refusing to cut off the phones and the turning
away of deliveries of special geriatric beds and cement for building work.</p>

<p>These conferences are for TU delegates, convenors, shop stewards
etc. from the localities. They are to discuss arrangements to be made
for borough-wide stoppages in the two areas to save the health services.</p>
