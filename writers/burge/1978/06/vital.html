<h1>NHS &#8211; Vital Service Threatened</h1>

<h3>(June 1978)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Militant</strong>, No.&nbsp;410, 16 June 1978, p.&nbsp;4.<br />
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<br />
<p class="fst"><strong>The cuts have hit yet another part of the National Health
Service. Eight staff from the vital Emergency Bed Services [EBS] in
London have been suspended.</strong></p>

<p>Three are shop stewards, and two are branch officers. They have
been &#8216;disciplined&#8217; for continuing to send patients to the
Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital for women which Health
Authorities are attempting to run down prior to complete closure.</p>

<p>The stand being taken by EBS staff in continuing to send patients
to threatened hospitals is crucial to the campaign to keep hospitals
open. So long as they have written confirmation from consultants that
services are being maintained, the EBS staff are willing to send
patients to these hospitals, despite contrary instructions from management.</p>

<p>The thirty EBS staff work from Guys Hospital, receiving requests
from GPs, mainly in the deprived areas and monitoring bed
availability in the London areas. Their service has become more and
more critical as staff shortages and closures reduce the number of
beds in all areas.</p>

<p>The stand they have taken in defence of the patients and of the
NHS, is to be applauded. EBS staff have been ready to step in with
real help when hospitals have been in need. Now is <em>their</em> time
of need.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Support this fight</h4>

<p class="fst">With eight COHSE members already suspended, there is the danger of
the service being closed altogether. This shows once again the
lengths management are prepared to go to enforce hospital closures.</p>

<p>COHSE has already given official recognition to their members in
dispute. Theirs is only a small branch. We urge <em>messages of
support and donations</em> be rushed to:</p>

<p class="c">Sandra Mead, Branch Secretary, EBS COHSE Branch, Fielden House, 28
London Bridge Street, S.E.1.</p>
