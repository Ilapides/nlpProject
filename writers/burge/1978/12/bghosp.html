<p class="fst">History was made at this month&#8217;s meeting of the City and East
London Area Health Authority. The Authority was forced to recognise
the Tower Hamlets shop stewards&#8217; committee and start negotiating.</p>
<p>In the five years since the AHA was constituted participation in
the proceedings has been confined to members of the Authority and its
officers. The Chairman, Mr Cumberlege (of Messrs Thomas Cumberlege
and Inskipp, tea brokers) has always maintained that &#8216;members of
the public&#8217; &#8211; and this, for him, includes health service workers
and their representatives &#8211; cannot participate.</p>

<p>At earlier discussion with the District Administrator it was made
clear to us that the management were not able to negotiate on Bethnal
Green Hospital because their hands were tied by the AHA. The reply
from one of his officers bleated about &#8216;numerous requests from a
large variety of representative groups&#8217;. He hoped we would
understand his &#8216;reluctance to add to the list which on the basis of
time alone could not be accommodated.&#8217;</p>

<p>Management have thus deliberately avoided hearing the views of the
staff and their trade unions. They have blindly attempted to press on
with their plans, regardless of the hospital workers and the local
trade union movement. Through the &#8216;blacking&#8217; by the unions of
conversion work at Bethnal Green Hospital, a whole chain of
inter-dependent plans also affecting the adjacent Hackney Borough and
the start of a new hospital there, have been held up.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Mandarins</h4>

<p>The management at Area level, those remote mandarins who act as
the executive for the AHA, had adopted a complete dog-in-the-manger
attitude. Here were the unions holding up numerous plans &#8211;
management were quite happy to just sit tight and let the services
run down.</p>

<p>Members of the Authority suddenly realised what was happening: the
plans could not be implemented without union co-operation, the
unions&#8217; co-operation was dependent on meaningful negotiations and
they were willing to come to a compromise &#8211; yet management were
intransigent. Finance earmarked for their new hospital was under
increasing threat of being re-allocated elsewhere, due entirely to
the incompetence and rigidity of Area management.</p>

<p>In the meeting, AHA members demanded that the shop stewards
present in the public gallery be asked to negotiate. Swallowing his
pride, the chairman had to appeal to the stewards&#8217; spokesman (Ian
Burge). But the terms were too narrow &#8211; the spokesman explained he
would need to consult with the committee. A recess was granted, and
the stewards retired to an ante-chamber to consider the offer.</p>

<p>We drew up a statement declaring our terms, and returned to read
it out. Confusion reigned. The chairman didn&#8217;t know what to do &#8211;
he threw up his hands declaring the whole matter open for debate.</p>

<p>To try and help resolve the matter, the stewards&#8217; spokesman
referred to a proposal made by one member that the Tower Hamlets
management be given authority to negotiate with the JSSC, in effect
without their hands tied. Thus item 9 on the agenda, &#8216;to consider a
report on the present situation&#8217; concerning Bethnal Green Hospital, closed.</p>
