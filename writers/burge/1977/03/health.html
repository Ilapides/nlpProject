<h1>Good health! &#8211; depends on which class you are</h1>

<h3>(March 1977)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Militant</strong>, No.&nbsp;348, 25 March 1977, p.&nbsp;5.<br />
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<br />
<p class="fst"><em>From the General Household Survey interviews, men of working
age in the professional classes reported losing, on average, fewer
than four working days a year, whereas unskilled manual workers
reported losing more than eighteen days annually. If the whole of the
male working population had had a sickness absence rate equivalent to
that reported by the professional classes there would be an annual
saving of about 100 million working days.</em></p>

<p>Unskilled manual workers and their families suffer two or three
times more than senior professional and managerial families from
almost all the major causes of premature death, and the overall death
rate is now 50% higher in the bottom quarter of the population than
the top quarter. This means that the working class generally are
considerably more susceptible to early death than the middle and
upper classes.</p>

<p>These differences between the social classes is two or three times
as large now as it was during the 1930s and 1940s (see chart).
Although the illustration is based on the figures for males, working
class women suffer a worse health record than do middle class women.</p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">Women aged 15 to 64 years whose husbands were in the professional
groups were subject to a death rate (adjusted for age) 35% below the
national average while women whose husbands were in unskilled
occupations had a mortality 66% above the professional figure. This
shows that disparities cannot be attributed to employment factors
alone. The working class mother is more than twice as likely to die
from complications during pregnancy and birth as her middle class counterpart.</p>

<p>One of the health measures most strongly reflecting the general
living standards is the infant mortality rates. Here again there are
tremendous differences to de found in different areas, for example
Bromley, a middle class southern suburb of London, has an infant
mortality rate of 12.4 in a thousand. Lambeth however, a few miles
away and working class, has a rate of 20.8.</p>

<p>Perinatal mortality, that is the number of deaths at birth or
during the first few days of life, per thousand deliveries, is 28.9
in Tameside, Manchester, and 13.2 in Oxfordshire. The national figure
is about 19, compared with Sweden&#8217;s 12.</p>

<p>The Court committee&#8217;s report on Child Health Care, published
last December, noted that &#8220;<em>twice as many children of unskilled
workers die in the first month of life as children of professional
workers, and the gap between the social classes in this respect has
been widening steadily for 25 years</em>.&#8221; Some causes of infant
death, such as gastroenteritis and pneumonia, are five times more
prevalent in the working class than in the higher social classes.</p>

<p>The working of the present Abortion Act leads to many anomalies.
In some areas it is easier than others to obtain an NHS abortion. But
there is no area where all abortions are done on the NHS. Relying on
private or charitable agencies discriminates against the working
class woman.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thus we see that the working class suffers a relatively greater
need for the services, in terms of its propensity to illness, yet at
the same time is relatively under-provided, as revealed by the
following examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lower spending in working class areas:</strong><br/>
&#163;18 per
head was spent on hospital services in the industrial Sheffield
Region, 1971-72, compared with &#163;34 per head spent in the South West
Metropolitan Region. Statistical work in <strong>The Lancet</strong> showed
that community health expenditure was more where there was a higher
number of the professional and managerial groups, and less where
there was a higher number of unskilled and semi-skilled groups.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Doctors have bigger patient lists in working class
areas:</strong><br/>
In towns such as Dudley, St Helens and Grimsby
General Practitioners have about 3,000 patients on their lists &#8211;
compared to Torquay or Herefordshire, which have only about 2,000 on
the lists. The national average is 2,460 (1973).<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Fewer modern buildings:</strong><br/>
An article in <strong>Modern
Care</strong> in 1965 showed that in predominantly working class areas,
80% of the doctors&#8217; surgeries were built before 1900, only 5%
since 1945; in middle class areas less than 50% were built before
1900, 25% since 1945.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li><strong>Quality of service:</strong><br/>
A study on hospital care in
1965 showed that middle class area GPs had more access to contrast
media X-rays, nearly five times as many had access to physiotherapy,
nearly three times as many visited their patients when they were in
hospital under a specialist.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p class="fst">A comparison between the working class area of East London with
Essex gives you a clear picture of inequality. The infant mortality
rate is 50% higher in E. London than in Essex. In 1974 the
notification rate for TB in E. London was <em>three times the national
average and over seven times the rate for Essex</em>. And it is
getting worse. Between 1967 and 1974 respiratory TB increased in E.
London by 50% and no-respiratory TB <em>doubled</em>.</p>

<p>The poor health of the working class compared to the middle class
is a direct result of the living conditions imposed on us by
capitalism. Lack of money to buy sufficient food, fewer holidays, bad
working conditions and long working hours, fewer recreation
facilities combined with bad housing forced on us by profit-conscious
landlords makes a joke of &#8220;equality of life&#8221; in this class
society.</p>

<p>In 1971 overcrowding was 50% worse in E. London than the whole GLC
area. 4&#189; times more E. London households had no fixed bath than
those in Essex; three times more had an outside toilet only; and
three times more had no continuous hot water. Yet despite greater
need for health care, the percentage of GPs there working single
handed is almost twice the national average and the percentage of GPs
over the age of 60 is also nearly twice the national average. There
are only 12.7 health visitors per 100,000 population instead of the
23 recommended for such high risk areas.</p>

<p>A number of government publications have appeared during the last
year dealing with the problems of the NHS. A future article in
<strong>Militant</strong> will discuss these in more detail. Their main
proposal is that the inadequacies in the services are somehow to be
made good by redistributing funds from &#8216;rich&#8217; areas. <em>There are
no &#8216;rich&#8217; areas.</em> As a matter of fact, the City and East
London is designated as a comparatively &#8216;rich&#8217; area! What the NHS
needs as a matter of great urgency is a massive injection of funds to
bring up all the services to a decent standard, as far as the working
class are concerned.</p>

<ol>
<li>Reverse the cuts.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>For full manning and equipment of services.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>For an expansion of all parts of the NHS, especially in the
deprived working class areas, to end the inequality of health.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>For a socialist health plan in a socialist economy.</li>
