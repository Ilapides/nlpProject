<p class="fst">All admissions have been stopped by management at the London
Hospital, and at Mile End and St Clements. Essential portering and
ancillary staff are in dispute with management over the payment of
money owed over a period of 13 years. They are operating an overtime
ban and work to rule. Their action has proved that the hospital
cannot function without staff working long hours and without their
great fund of goodwill and devotion.</p>

<p>The money is due to the workers who work overtime on a regular
basis, under an agreement signed in 1964. Representatives of the
ancillary workers recently discovered that management had never paid
these workers their full entitlement. Management have admitted this
and have agreed to give back pay, but only at the old rates, which
would be taxed at current rates!</p>

<p>The union is quite correctly demanding that the money owed is paid
at present rates of pay rather than the rates in operation for each
year. Inflation and tax increases have eroded the value of back pay
to which they are entitled.</p>

<p>Management have claimed that they cannot give back pay at current
rate because the Department of Health won&#8217;t allow it, yet many
hospitals up and down the country, and even one under the same Area
Health Authority, have already given the full payment demanded by the
NUPE members.</p>

<p>Negotiations have been dragging on for 18 months and management
have been trying to take advantage of an apparent lull in militancy.
This has had the reverse effect to that intended. Instead of dividing
the workers, management&#8217;s petty actions have welded the workers
together in a more determined mood. Although only NUPE is involved at
present, all unions are standing together in support.</p>
