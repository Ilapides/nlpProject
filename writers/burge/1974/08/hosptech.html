<p class="fst">Dear Comrades,</p>

<p class="fst">The technicians dispute was settled last week when divisional
delegates voted in London 90&#8211;1 for acceptance of the latest offer
from the management side. The increases average at 20%, over twice
the original offer, but still short of the 30% aimed for. However a
further 7&#189;% increase has already been agreed as a cost of living
rise under Phase Three.</p>

<p>The distribution of the increase over the scales has been a
partial rationalisation towards a future amalgamation of all
technician grades. This can be seen as a move against past policy of
dividing the technicians into many separate negotiating groups, when
it was easier for management to play off one group against the other.</p>

<p>Radiographers depending on the pitiful and confusing campaign
being conducted by their &#8220;professional&#8221; society can learn a
lesson from the technicians. The backing of a Trade Union and strong
national and local organisation is essential in any fight on wages.
Although co-ordination between the unions (ASTMS, NALGO and NUPE)
left a lot to be desired at national level, the liaison at a local
level was excellent, with joint strike committee organising the
picket and emergency services were provided. Indispensable has been
the support of drivers refusing to cross the picket lines, and also
the enormous public support. Hardship has been alleviated by strike
pay from the unions and collections taken by sympathetic sections of
workers. Trade Union solidarity has helped shorten the strike,
reducing the effect on patients.</p>
