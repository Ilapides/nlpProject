<h1>Don&#8217;t Forget the Chairman</h1>

<h3>(May 1971)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From the <strong>International Socialism, Internal Bulletin</strong>, May 1971<br />
Transcribed by Ted Crawford September 2012.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">Two points. I have spoken at a good many IS branch and public meetings around the country over the past year. Almost universally the chairing of meetings is deplorable. Self-effacing, muttering, indecisive. Firm chairing (including the repression of the speaker if necessary) is a tradition of the working class movement. Please insist that branches appreciate its necessity. Also, and even worse, I attend branch business meetings wherever possible. It is quite staggering how few adopt proper procedure for the dispatch of business. Minutes kept, reading of minutes, making definite proposals which can be voted on, sticking to one thing at a time, moving that question be now put, aiming to finish business as rapidly as possible. Workers expect this kind of thing, and they are liable to discount the seriousness of organisations which don&#8217;t observe such conventions in a sensible way.</p>

<p>Branches will have to realise that they are wasting time by having everyone discussing every little arrangement and item of administration. The branch can only discuss policy and serious hang ups. The implementation must be left to the branch committee.</p>
