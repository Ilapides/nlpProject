<p class="fst">Chris Harman has invited comment on his recent writings on the
world economy and there is certainly much for Marxists to debate. We
are confronted with a global economy, hugely uneven to be sure, but
which in 2007 was producing no less than 25 percent more goods and
services than just six years earlier. However, many on the left,
including Harman, believe that the basic tendency of the system
remains inflected towards stagnation in profits and rates of
accumulation &#8211; as it has been, in their view, since the 1970s. They
argue that the recent period of growth since 2001 has been based
mainly on the build-up of unsustainable levels of debt, notably,
rapid increases in household borrowing in the US based on soaring
house prices. It is certainly true that this increase in debt helped
finance a series of huge US trade deficits, which in turn boosted
fast export-led growth in China and other emerging economies.</p>
<p>At the start of 2008 a wider international downturn is in
progress. US house prices have collapsed, recession looms in the US,
the dollar has fallen further and a crisis of unpayable debt has
repercussed through the international banking system. What is now
crucial is whether the new centres of accumulation in China and the
rest of the industrialising world are large enough and dynamic enough
to limit the recessionary impact of credit crisis. No one can be
sure, but what happens over the next two to three years will be a
decisive test.</p>

<p>In this article I will argue three main points against Harman&#8217;s
vision of the world economy, and the theory on which it is based.&nbsp;<a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<ol>
<li>Despite repeated phases of temporary downturn &#8211; and
massive increases in economic inequality &#8211; the basic story of the
world economy over the past 25 years has been one of rising profits,
and growth in output and levels of capital accumulation. Advances in
productivity have not undermined profitability as would be expected
according to Harman&#8217;s analysis.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Harman uses Marx&#8217;s declining rate of profit analysis in
rather an abstract way, focusing too much on the average rate and
giving insufficient weight to the countertendencies that Marx saw as
limiting or reversing the tendency for overall profitability to
fall.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>He also makes too little use of Marx&#8217;s account of the
forces that drive accumulation in the capitalist system: its
tendency to expand geographically; to increase the mass and rate of
profits by opening up new branches of production; to build up the
quantities of capital deployed in the world&#8217;s productive system
and multiply the numbers of workers employed by capital. Harman&#8217;s
attention is not focused on the astonishing growth in recent decades
in the size of the system, and the momentum given to it by enormous
rises in the mass of extra profit generated. His analysis is limited
rather narrowly to rates of profit. He neglects trends in the rate
of formation of new capitals, relying here on an incorrect view that
concentration of capital in most strategic sectors of the world
economy blocks the entry of new firms into successful competition.
He therefore seriously underestimates the role that the current
dynamism of China and other large emerging countries can play in
limiting the recession now starting and in sustaining a further
phase of overall growth.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">I do agree, however, with Harman&#8217;s broader perspective that
political crises, rooted in the economics of the system, will
continue and are likely to deepen. We face tightening ecological
constraints, intensifying contrasts between extremes of wealth and
poverty, and the social destructiveness inflicted by the never-ending
competitive restructuring of capital.</p>

<p class="fst">An important measure of the performance of the world economy is
the annual percentage rate of growth in production. Figure 1 gives
the IMF&#8217;s estimate of world GDP growth (in real terms) since 1970.
It shows that in about half of the 36 years covered growth was above
or close to 4 percent a year. There were five periods of downturn,
but in only two years did annual growth fall to less than 2 percent.
The last two recessions followed each other quite quickly but were
shallower and briefer than the more serious contractions at the start
of the 1980s, and that of 1990&#8211;1. In the five years ending in 2006
growth averaged over 4 percent, and the same has turned out to be the
case in 2007, despite the serious financial crisis which started last
August. World population has increased since 1970, but the average
rate of economic growth per person has still averaged nearly 3
percent per year.</p>

<p>The distribution of all this extra output has, of course, been
extremely unequal. In most countries the upper income groups have
secured enormous increases in their wealth and income. About one
billion people live on the equivalent of $1 a day or less, which
represents a fall since 1980 from 27.9 percent to 21.1 percent of the
world&#8217;s population. But total world population has grown over this
period, which means that there are large numbers of people who have
seen a serious degree of improvement in their material situation. In
some areas, especially in Africa and the Middle East, there has been
a horrifying deterioration in living standards. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>
But in China, for example, over the period since 1980, the numbers of
people living on less than $1 a day fell from 600 million to below
180 million, a decrease of more than 400 million people just in one
generation. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> The bitter knowledge that
an even greater rate of poverty reduction might have been attained in
China (and elsewhere in the world) should not blind us to the
magnitude of this achievement by the toil of working people and
advances in productive techniques.</p>

<p>Thus the picture is one of a capitalist system that is highly
dynamic and growing in terms of overall output, though with huge
social unevenness over geographical space, and a marked cyclical
pattern over time. But how sustainable are current levels of growth?
Will the present financial crisis and associated downturn in the
giant US economy be just another brief and shallow recession like the
five previous ones? Or are we starting to see the impact of more
serious limits in the recent pattern of growth?</p>

<p>To assess the situation more deeply we have to consider levels of
capital accumulation and profitability in the system. In an article
published last year Chris Harman reviews the literature about trends
in profits and comes to the following conclusions:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the industrial countries high profits in the 1960s were
followed by a period of sharp decline which ended in the early 1980s
with the profit rate about one third of the level of 20 years
before.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>&#8220;Profit rates did recover from about 1982 onwards, but
they only made up about half of the decline that had taken place in
the previous period&#8221;. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> Harman does
not comment on the overwhelming evidence that an enormous rise in
profitability in much of the world economy took place in the period
between 2001 and 2007. On the global situation, one authoritative
source, the Bank for International Settlements, reports that
&#8220;corporate profits in 2005 appear to have reached historical highs
as a proportion of global GDP&#8221;. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a>
Harman&#8217;s discussion is confined to Britain, the US and China. He
concedes that &#8220;for the moment profits in Britain appear to be high
... 15.6 percent for all non-financial corporations in the fourth
quarter of 2006 &#8211; the highest figure since 1969&#8221;. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a>
On the US Harman gives no figures, but suggests only that the
upsurge of financial speculation and private equity takeovers will
mean that &#8220;corporate profits will be being puffed up until they
lose touch with reality&#8221;. In actual fact the ratio of share prices
to company profits has not been exceptionally high in recent years
in the US. Fred Moseley concludes in a recent article:</li>
</ol>

<p class="quoteb">The rate of profit in the US is now approaching the
previous peaks achieved in the 1960s. The last several years
especially, since the recession of 2001, have seen a very strong
recovery of profits, as real wages have not increased at all, and
productivity has increased very rapidly (4-5 percent a year). And
these estimates do not include the profits of US companies from their
production abroad, but include only profits from domestic US
production. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the period 2004&#8211;6 annual profits in the US continued to rise,
from $1,331 billion in 2004 to an estimated $1,653 billion in 2006.
<a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p>On profits in China, reliable sources report massive recent
increases. For example, Lardy estimates that &#8220;from 1998 through to
the first half of 2006, profits of industrial enterprises in China
soared from 2 percent of GNP to over 10 percent&#8221;. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a>
The World Bank&#8217;s Beijing office, in its latest report, says that
&#8220;profit margins in China&#8217;s industry have continued their trend
increase, supported by continued rapid growth of efficiency and
labour productivity&#8221;. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p>Of course, overall profit levels in the system vary cyclically and
there is no reason to suppose that the recent upsurge in
profitability in China and much of the rest of the world economy will
not be followed at some point by a downturn. It may well have started
in 2008. But what would prevent a further recovery in the near
future, as happened after the temporary downturn around 2001? In
October 1987 world equity markets crashed by 30 percent in a few
days, but interest rate cuts implemented by the US Federal Reserve
and other central banks contained the crisis. The effect on jobs and
profitability in the industrial sector was very limited. The same was
true of the massive downward lurch in US bond markets in February
1994. As Marx noted, because the financial markets are often
dominated by speculative pressures they can, for long periods, become
relatively autonomous from the productive economy. Thus, he
concluded, financial crises, even if severe, need not necessarily
have a corresponding impact on commodity production.</p>

<p>There are many problems of measurement and definition of profits,
but really no clear evidence of any pattern of long term fall in the
rate of profit. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> Profit rates in
the industrial countries were high in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
They fell sharply in the late 1960s and 1970s, rose again after 1982,
hit a short but steep downturn around 2001 and recovered strongly
through to 2007.</p>

<p>Harman reads Marx as arguing that the deepest and most persistent
tendency in the system is for average profit rates to decline, though
the decline can be slowed, or even in some periods reversed, by the
operation of countervailing processes. Harman explains:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Marx&#8217;s basic line of argument was simple enough. Each
individual capitalist can increase his (occasionally her)
competitiveness through increasing the productivity of his workers.
The way to do this is by using a greater quantity of the &#8220;means of
production&#8221; &#8211; tools, machinery and so on &#8211; for each worker. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p class="fst">What matters here is not physical productivity &#8211; a few workers
operating a semi-automated production line, or a huge container ship
&#8211; compared with how it was done 50 years ago. Productivity is seen
as increasing the organic composition of capital, i.e. a rise in the
ratio of machinery to the labour that operates it. Thus the hours of
socially necessary labour-time incorporated in the means of
production tend to increase, but the number of hours of unpaid labour
&#8211; the surplus value extracted &#8211; does not rise correspondingly,
and may even fall. Thus Harman&#8217;s argument is that the increase in
productivity, which results from the pressures of competition, must
inevitably put &#8220;a downward pressure on the ratio of profit to
investment &#8211; the rate of profit&#8221;. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p>This is certainly a correct summary of Marx&#8217;s argument that
productivity advance undermines the rate of profit by raising the
organic composition of capital. However, this is stated by Marx as a
tendency only, and one which operates at a very high level of
abstraction. Marx modifies his abstract argument in a number of
crucial ways as he develops, stage by stage, an analysis of how
capitalism operates as a concrete historical system. Harman gives
insufficient weight to the ways in which Marx qualifies his abstract
argument.</p>
<p>For example, Harman writes that &#8220;each capitalist has to push for
greater productivity in order to stay ahead of the competition. But
what seems beneficial to an individual capitalist is disastrous for
the capitalist class as a whole&#8221;. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a>
This is a surely gross overstatement. Over the neoliberal epoch since
1980 productivity has been rising persistently throughout most of the
world. Yet all the evidence shows that the global capitalist class is
doing fine. It has been growing rapidly in numbers, and in the amount
and proportion of the world&#8217;s wealth which it owns and controls.</p>

<p>Harman emphasises that aggressive price-cutting competition by
innovative firms undermines profits and devalues the capital of
rivals who are stuck with old technology, and may put them out of
business altogether. These losses have to be deducted from the
overall rate of profit in each branch of production. But such capital
devaluation and lowering of profits are directly damaging only for
those companies with outmoded means of production.</p>

<p>As Marx points out, the firms which find new ways of increasing
productivity are able, as they cut costs, to secure an above average
rate of profit &#8211; surplus profit in Marx&#8217;s phrase &#8211; and the
average overall rate of profit in a capitalist economy is raised by
such surplus profits. It is true that as their competitors adopt the
new methods there is a general fall in prices of the commodities
being produced, and rates of profit for all producers in a given
branch of production fall towards an average. But Harman says nothing
about the effect of the surplus rates of profit secured during the
time period before the competition catches up. In his scheme,
innovations seem to be adopted virtually instantaneously by all
producers. Nor does he discuss the possibility of continuous ongoing
waves of innovation which would allow some firms to enjoy surplus
profits for much longer periods. Yet repeated advances in
productivity have been the pattern in recent years in many
industries. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p>And, in any case, as Harman does accept, in the longer run phases
of devaluation and elimination of less efficient capital clear the
way for higher profits among survivors. However, he discusses the law
of value and competition only in terms of bankruptcies, conceding
that the level of bankruptcy in the 1980s and 1990s had been higher
than he expected, because the role of the state in propping up
failing firms had been more limited than he had anticipated. But here
he underestimates the depth and savagery of the restructuring process
in Europe and the US in this period, and he says nothing about the
major form which it took. This was the internal restructuring as
large firms eliminated their less profitable operations, closed
loss-making factories, and imposed huge redundancies.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">The current credit crisis</h4>

<p class="fst">In the previous issue of <strong>International Socialism</strong> Harman
argues that the present credit crisis arose because in recent years
the US and European banking system has been awash with cash for which
the banks needed to find borrowers. Where did this extra money came
from? Harman notes that corporate investment in the industrial
countries, which fell during the recession of 2000-1, did not recover
to previous levels in the years following. Instead industrial
companies fed unused money capital into the banking system. The banks
recycled the money to the household sector especially in the form of
vast increases in mortgage lending. This pushed up house prices and
allowed more borrowing which drove up house prices even more &#8211; in a
self-feeding bubble, which, while it lasted, sustained consumer demand.</p>

<p>Harman accepts Riccardo Bellofiore&#8217;s characterisation of this as
&#8220;privatised Keynesianism&#8221;. The mechanism went into reverse when
the subprime crisis imploded in August 2007. The effect will be,
Harman argues, that the fundamental long-term forces of low profits
and industrial overcapacity will now reassert themselves strongly:
&#8220;Only the financial bubble stopped recession occurring earlier.&#8221;
As over-indebted households cut back on their spending the fall in
consumer demand will spread recession in the G7 countries. The
emergent countries will be hit as their exports to the industrial
countries collapse.</p>

<p>Certainly Harman is quite correct to stress that in the four-year
period up to 2005 industrial investment lagged behind profits in the
G7 countries and that this was one source of the housing-based bubble
in bank lending. The IMF reports that in the G7 countries &#8220;on
average over 2002&#8211;4 the excess saving of the corporate sector &#8211;
defined as the difference between undistributed profits and capital
spending &#8211; was at a historical high of 2.5 percent of GDP&#8221;. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a>
Harman sees this lag in corporate investment as decisive evidence of
a basic stagnation since the 1970s in profits and rates of
accumulation in the industrial countries. Here there are two
objections to be made. First, the IMF report emphasises that &#8220;one
factor behind the increase in corporate saving has been the strong
rise in profitability that has underpinned higher corporate saving
despite an increase in dividends paid&#8221;. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a>
Thus the lag in investment was not due to a lack of profitability, as
Harman&#8217;s basic line of argument tends to suggest.</p>

<p>Second, there is evidence that industrial investment in G7 has
recovered considerably since 2004. For example, the latest OECD
report on the question shows that net saving by the corporate sector
was down to only 1 percent of GDP by 2006. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a>
However, even if based on high profits, this is still a sizeable
surplus of savings over investment. Nevertheless, before invoking the
lack of demand which Keynes saw as underlying the slump of the early
1930s, we have to consider how far the present very high rate of
investment and consumption in the emergent world will plug the gap
left by a diminished rate of growth in consumer demand in the
industrial countries. I will return to this, but first it is
essential to consider the recent investment lag in a Marxist
framework, rather than rest content with a Keynesian
underconsumptionist perspective.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Productivity and the organic composition of capital</h4>

<p class="fst">If the rate of productivity growth in department one of the
economy, which produces means of production, is faster than in
department two, which produces wage goods, then the effect will be a
fall in the ration of constant capital to labour. There is strong
evidence that this has recently been the case. A carefully researched
report by the Bank for International Settlements concludes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Record profits, high cash levels [in companies] and low
interest rates have not prompted record corporate investment ...
Indeed corporate investment as a share of GDP remained low in the G3
economies by past standards ... That nominal investment/GDP ratios
are still low in most advanced economies remains a puzzle. Part of
the explanation could be the fall in the relative price of business
fixed investment. For instance, in Japan and the US the price of
capital goods has declined by between 25 and 40 percent since 1980.
<a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The IMF notes that the lag in investment levels in 2002&#8211;4 was
temporary and in part due to &#8220;a short-term reaction to the high
corporate debt levels of the early 2000s&#8221;. But the IMF adds that
&#8220;there has also been a longer-term downward trend in the relative
price of capital goods&#8221; and this explains &#8220;about one half of the
decline in the nominal investment ratio&#8221;. Looking to the future,
the IMF suggests that &#8220;technological progress will likely continue
to lower the prices of capital goods, especially in information
technology&#8221;. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p>This is the process that Marx calls the cheapening of the elements
of constant capital. Because productivity has soared in the sectors
of the economy which make means of production, industrial companies
have been able to meet production targets with relatively limited
investment in money terms. The result &#8211; in combination with rapidly
rising profits &#8211; has been to leave many companies with ample cash
reserves and debt-to-profits gearing ratios at unprecedented low
levels. If the recession that has now started in the US does turn out
to be limited in its effect on production and jobs in the world
economy, a major reason will be the current financial robustness of
the industrial sector.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Profitability and the cheapening of constant capital</h4>

<p class="fst">The cheapening of the elements of constant capital has
contradictory effects on the underlying profitability of the system.
It slows down, or maybe even reverses, the build-up in the organic
composition of capital &#8211; which, as I noted earlier, is central in
Harman&#8217;s &#8220;declining rate of profit&#8221; reading of Marx. But, as
Marx noted in a little studied section of <strong>Capital</strong>, lower
prices for means of production have the effect of releasing capital
from the circuits of productive capital. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a>
It is this loss of demand that allows Harman to argue that a lower
rate of growth in investment in money terms could spread recession.
But to clarify which of these conflicting tendencies predominates in
the global economy today requires attention to some crucial and often
overlooked elements in Marx&#8217;s analysis of accumulation and profitability.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Some other countertendencies</h4>

<p class="fst">Chris Harman&#8217;s attention tends to be focused on only one form of
accumulation &#8211; the intensive accumulation of mechanisation and
rising productivity. But in Marx we also find discussion of a second
sort &#8211; extensive accumulation in which investment takes place in
new branches of production and in geographically new centres of
production, and in which extra workers are drawn into capitalist
production. The extra workers come from two main sources. They are
either workers whose jobs have vanished because of the increase in
productivity or workers new to capitalism, for example, those drawn
from the peasant sectors of the economy.</p>

<p>The scale of extensive accumulation in the Global South in the
recent period has been extraordinary, much of it based on local
accumulations of capital derived from surplus extraction from
peasants, rather than capital exported from the industrialised North.
Chinese wages, for example, are 1/20th of US wages, so rates of
exploitation can be very high, though limited of course by the
intensity of competition in the markets for commodities produced.
Richard Freeman estimates that the labour force available to global
capital, either for direct employment or as a reserve army of labour,
tripled from just under one billion workers in 1980 to over three
billion in 2000. He calculates that 1.5 billion workers were added to
the actual or potential capitalist labour force by its incorporation
of China, India and the former Soviet bloc. The other half billion
workers came from population growth in countries that were already
part of the capitalist system in 1980, especially in Africa and Latin
America. Freeman also notes the sizeable effect of extensive
accumulation in cutting what Marxists call the organic composition of
capital: &#8220;The entry of China, India and the former Soviet bloc into
the global economy cut the global capital/output ratio by 55 percent,
to just 60 percent of what it otherwise would have been.&#8221; <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a>
As I noted earlier, Marx argued that this fall in the average organic
composition of capital will tend to boost rates of profit.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">China as a driver of world accumulation</h4>

<p class="fst">I have already shown that profits in China have soared in recent
years. Harman argues that the Chinese economy is still far from being
large enough to act as locomotive in pulling the advanced countries
out of the impending recession. He notes that, at dollar exchange
rates, China produces only 6 percent of world GDP. But this takes no
account of the large undervaluation of the <em>renminbi</em> against
the dollar. In any case the capacity of China, a driver of the world
economy, is much greater than GDP figures would suggest. GDP in China
has been expanding at the rate of 10 percent a year, and nearly half
of this is reinvested. The increase in investment in China accounts
for a large part, maybe 20 percent, of the annual increase in world
capital formation in recent years. Profits from production in China
are not just retained domestically, or transformed into the vast
Chinese holding of US financial assets, but are widely shared among
the foreign capitals that invest in China, thus helping to offset the
damage done to profits elsewhere in the world by Chinese competitive success.</p>

<p>Foreign capital, American and Japanese especially, is sharing
lavishly in the profitability of the &#8220;Chinese&#8221; economy. For
example, the US government reported that &#8220;in the first six months
of 2006, US corporate profits in China passed $2 billion, up more
than 50 percent from the first half of last year. US companies were
on pace to earn more in China in 2006 than they earned there during
the entire 1990s&#8221;. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a> Demand from
China for raw materials and other imports is fuelling growth
throughout much of East Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Nor
is the Chinese productive system as dependent on exports to the US as
is claimed by many, Harman included. The World Bank reports that only
one quarter of growth in 2006-7 was accounted for by an increase in
exports. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p>

<p>In a useful recent article the <strong>Economist</strong> points out two
developments that will limit the global impact of recession in the US
and Europe, and act to offset the G7 investment lag that Harman
stresses. First, half of China&#8217;s exports now go to other emerging
economies. Indeed, Chinese exports to Brazil, India and Russia were
up by 60 percent in 2007, and to oil exporters by 45 percent. Exports
to the US account for only 8 percent of Chinese GDP, 4 percent of
India&#8217;s, 3 percent of Brazil&#8217;s and 1 percent of Russia&#8217;s.
Second, in 2007 consumer spending in the emergent countries rose
almost three times as fast as in the developed world:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Investment seems to be holding up even better: according
to HSBC real capital spending rose by a staggering 17 percent in
emerging economies last year compared with only 1.2 percent in rich
countries. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Exports from the US and Europe to the emerging world are rising
rapidly, especially in the capital goods sector. It is certainly not
possible to predict how severe and extensive the crisis unfolding in
2008 will turn out to be. But so far it does not look like a classic
Marx-Minsky type of crisis of corporate indebtedness. In general
industrial companies in most major countries have responded to the
high profitability since 2001 by running down debt, buying back
shares and building up cash reserves &#8211; all of which will help them
ride out a downturn. In addition it is important to register that in
recent years China has been only the most dramatic example of a more
general pattern of more rapid growth in the industrialising than in
the industrial economies. In 2006 GDP in India increased by 9.2
percent, in Russia by 6.7 percent, in Latin America by 5.5 percent.
In the emerging and developing world as a whole it grew by 7.9
percent, compared to 3.2 percent for the advanced economies. This
growth is deeply uneven between different regions and social classes.
Moreover, such figures do not measure what is essential for a Marxist
analysis, namely rates of accumulation. But they unmistakeably
indicate that very high levels of capital accumulation are taking place.</p>

<p>My fundamental difference with Harman is that his discussion of
the rate of profit fails crucially to register the political and
economic consequences of the sheer momentum of current accumulation.
He is preoccupied with average rates of profit, but what drives the
system is the quest for surplus profit. We often use Trotsky&#8217;s
phrase &#8220;combined and uneven development&#8221;, but in practice
discussion focuses mainly on the unevenness of capitalist
development. My plea is for much more attention to current patterns
of combined development. Large numbers of new workers each year are
entering direct capitalist employment. Many of them move into jobs in
technically advanced factories and offices at high levels of
productivity, and are thus subject to high rates of exploitation. In
the present period what we urgently need to be thinking and debating
about are the economic and political consequences for the system &#8211;
and for our politics &#8211; when accumulation is both rapid and global,
and when extensive and intensive accumulation are closely combined.</p>

reprints Brenner&#8217;s data showing a fall in the rate of profit of
manufacturing capital in the US, Germany and Japan from 1970 to 2000.
See also Harman, 2008, p33. Neither Brenner nor Harman take account
of the shift in manufacturing to the Global South, the massive rise
of a labour intensive service sector in the advanced economies, and
the post-2000 rise in profit rates in G3 manufacturing (even in Japan).</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f12" name="n12">12.</a> Harman, 2007a, p.&nbsp;142.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f13" name="n13">13.</a> Harman, 2007a, p.&nbsp;142. For
an account of value as the monetary expression of socially necessary
labour-time, see Marx, 1981, chapters 13&#8211;15. Harman&#8217;s account of
the organic composition of capital, and its presumed effect on profit
rates, is similar to that presented in Fine and Saad-Filho, 2004. For
a detailed critique of this approach, see Kincaid, 2007. Ben Fine and
Alfredo Saad-Filho have responded with a detailed defence of their
position. This will be published by <strong>Historical Materialism</strong> in
2008, together with a critical reply by myself which also proposes an
alternative reading of Marx&#8217;s account of profits and value theory.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f15" name="n15">15.</a> Harman considers that computers
have increased productivity in only limited sectors of the economy.
&#8220;The US has experienced high levels of productivity due to
computerisation, but they have mainly been centred in the computer
industry itself and in the retail trade&#8221; &#8211; Harman, 2007b, p.&nbsp;13.
This is a very questionable statement. The effects of
computerisation, and associated internet technology in the US and in
the rest of the world have been enormous and they have been
experienced right across the spectrum of commodity production,
including cultural products as well as goods and services.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f18" name="n18">18.</a> OECD, 2007, chapter 3. Such

investment by G7 companies in emergent countries such as China.</p>
<p class="note"><a href="#f19" name="n19">19.</a> Bank for International
Settlements, 2006, p.&nbsp;24. Incidentally Japan shows investment at
14 percent of GDP, i.e. higher than the US at about 9 percent and
Europe at 10 percent. Lack of growth in Japanese GDP has not
precluded a fairly high rate of profitability and investment in
Japan.</p>

145. Harman, 1984, pp.&nbsp;20&#8211;23, discusses capital-saving
investment. He argues that &#8220;we can expect that there will always be
more innovations calling for increased capital than those calling for
less&#8221;. I remain unconvinced. Why should capital-saving investment
be less prevalent than investment to economise on labour?</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f21" name="n21">21.</a> Marx comments on what he calls
the release of capital which can result from productivity advance in
either the means of production or wage goods sectors. Marx, 1981, pp.&nbsp;206&#8211;209.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f22" name="n22">22.</a> Freeman, 2005, p.&nbsp;1. Marx
also discusses the boost to the average rate of profit provided by
the opening up of new branches of production, especially for what he
calls luxury consumption &#8211; often the production of services which
combine a low organic composition of capital with low wages and thus
a high rate of profit &#8211; &#8220;both the rate and mass of surplus value
in these branches of production are unusually high&#8221; &#8211; Marx, 1981,
p.&nbsp;344. Enormous numbers of such new branches of production have
been opened up in the modern capitalist economies.</p>
