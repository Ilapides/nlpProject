THE PROPHET ARMED, Trotsky: 1879–1921
by Isaac Deutscher
Oxford. University Press, 1954, 540 pp., $6.
Next to Lenin, Leon Trotsky (1879–1940) was the greatest revolutionary thinker and fighter of the 20th century. At the age of 26 he was the outstanding leader of the unsuccessful Russian revolution of 1905. Twelve years later he and Lenin were co-leaders of the first successful working class revolution in history. He organized and led the Red Army to victory over Russian and foreign counter-revolution. In 1923 he and Lenin (soon to die) started a fight against the bureaucratic degeneration of the Soviet Union represented by Stalinism. Expelled from the Communist International and exiled from the Soviet Union in the late 20’s, he kept the banner of revolutionary Marxism flying and gathered together the forces that formed the Fourth International in 1938, two years before he was assassinated by an agent of Stalin. A profound theoretician, he vastly enriched Marxist theory, illumined the major problems of our epoch, and pointed the road along which the international working class will march to socialist victory.
Isaac Deutscher, born in Poland and now a British subject, considered himself a Marxist in his youth. He is now a member of the editorial staff and “Russian expert” of the Economist. In 1949 he published the first part of a trilogy, Stalin: A Political Biography. In 1953, after Stalin’s death, he interrupted the trilogy with a book, Russia: What Next? The trilogy is resumed with the present book, the first half of a biography of Trotsky. After the second half, he plans to publish a study of Lenin.
 
Reaction to his books
Deutscher’s book on Stalin was widely hailed, especially in liberal circles, for its “objectivity.” The late John Dewey, for example, called it “a marvelous accomplishment” because of “the method by which he achieved an objective treatment,” which freed him from “the method of praise and blame.”
Our own review challenged this appraisal. We noted that Deutscher had borrowed liberally from Trotsky’s writings on the crimes of Stalin, while rejecting the Trotskyist analysis of Stalinism, and said: “He is well acquainted with the factual and documentary materials available on his subject and handles them scrupulously on the whole, although in general his method is to question all charges or testimony adverse to Stalin that cannot be verified beyond question, and to give him the benefit of the doubt in most such cases. It is this method, plus the curiously detached manner in which it is written, that has earned the book its reputation for objectivity in some quarters.”
The same thing has happened with. Deutscher’s book on Trotsky. While criticizing certain aspects, the liberal reviewers are impressed by its “objectivity.” Since this is its chief claim to serious attention, we must examine it more closely.
 
The bystander
Just what do these people mean by “objectivity”? Most of  the time, their ideal seems to be that, of the professor who devotes 15 minutes, to the pros of a question, 15 minutes to the cons, and 30 minutes to the wisdom of seeing both sides of the question and avoiding dogmatism. You ¥ start out with the notion that the truth generally lies somewhere in the middle, according to this conception, and that you are more likely to reach it when you are detached, impartial or even indifferent than when you are involved, passionate or partisan.
This is typically the view of the bystander (always ready to assure you that he is naturally a better judge of the rights and wrongs of a struggle than the participants in it) and it appeals most strongly to middle class thinkers.
Deutscher’s “Objectivity,” as we shall show, contains elements of the bystander conception.
 
Our conception
Our conception is different. To us objectivity is a scientific presentation of problems in such a way as to correspond most closely to reality. It involves approaching a problem honestly and with a check on one’s prejudices, viewing it historically and in its relation to other problems.
It should never be confused with detachment or impartiality: partisanship is not necessarily a bar to objectivity, and-impartiality is no guarantee of objectivity. The fan in the tenth row or even the referee in the ring is not necessarily a better judge of what happened during a mixup between two pugilists than they are. The professor in the classroom, even when he finally arrives at a conclusion, may, with all the advantages of his hindsight and study, understand less about the French revolution than an 18th century illiterate peasant who helped make it.
 
Can mask bias
Furthermore, there is reason to be suspicious of people whose chief credentials are their alleged impartiality. The professor who prides himself on his detachment may be just as biased as the revolutionary French peasant, though in a different direction.
It is relatively simple to consider strictly on its own merits a controversy over the quality of clothing worn in China in 400 B.C.; this is not an issue that directly concerns us, our struggles and our aspirations today. But it is not so easy to do the same thing with questions of a social-political-economic character that affect us most intimately.
The professor may or may not know it, but even his attitudes toward a revolution that happened almost 200 years ago are influenced and colored by the fact that he too lives in an age of revolution. “Objectivity” can mask the most pronounced (though unconscious) bias and partisanship. This is specially true of something like the Russian revolution, toward which no person with political interests today can really have any feeling of neutrality.
Deutscher, we shall show, is grinding an axe behind his pose of objective historian.
 
Historian’s duty
Trotsky, who was a great historian himself, touched on these matters because he was writing about history in which he had played a prominent part and recognized that some readers would reject his treatment of history for that very reason. In his preface to The History of the Russian Revolution, 1930, he urged the serious reader to demand from historians not “the so-called historian’s ’impartiality’ “ but “a scientific conscientiousness, which for its sympathies and antipathies &8211; open and undisguised &8211; seeks their real support in an honest study of the facts, a determination of their real connections, an exposure of the causal laws of their development.
”That is the only possible his, tonic objectivism, and moreover it is amply sufficient, for it is verified and attested not by the good intentions of the historian, for which only he himself can vouch, but by the natural laws revealed by him of the historic process itself.”
A year before, in the foreword to his autobiography, My Life, Trotsky dealt with the question as it related to biographical writing. He said:
 
”Conventional trick”
”This book is not a dispassionate photograph of my life, however, but a component part of it. In these pages, I continue the struggle to which my whole life is devoted. Describing, I also characterize and evaluate; narrating, I also defend myself, and more often attack. It seems to me that this is the only method of making an autobiography objective in a higher sense, that is, of making it the most adequate expression of personality, conditions, and epoch.
”Objectivity is not the pretended indifference with which confirmed hypocrisy, in speaking of friends and enemies, suggests in directly to the reader what it finds inconvenient to state directly. Objectivity of this sort is nothing but a conventional trick. I do not need it.”
But Deutscher needs this trick badly. Like Trotsky, like every historian, he writes in order to defend certain ideas. Unlike Trotsky, he does not avow these ideas openly and explicitly, but suggests them indirectly and cloaks himself behind the claim that he desires only to “restore the historical balance.” What his ideas are, and why he presents them in this way, will be discussed in subsequent articles.

A Slick Distortion about Trotsky and Lenin
(5 April 1954)

Isaac Deutscher, author of a new biography of Leon Trotsky (The Prophet Armed) wants to prove that he is more “objective” than Trotsky and has more to offer to students of Russian revolutionary history. To support this claim, he points to the controversies between Trotsky and Lenin between 1903 and 1917. He cannot accuse Trotsky of suppressing the facts about these controversies, so he accuses him of having “blurred” their sharp outlines and importance.
What are the facts?
Trotsky met Lenin in London in 1902 and worked closely with him until the 1903 congress of the Russian revolutionary party which ended in a split and the formation of the Bolshevik and Menshevik parties. Trotsky, not yet  24 years old, failed to understand the significance of the dispute and the necessity for the kind of party Lenin was trying to build. He went with the Mensheviks, and attacked Lenin vigorously.
 
The 1903 split
The Mensheviks differed from the Bolsheviks not only over internal organizational principles but also, it began to be clear, over theoretical and political perspectives for the Russian revolution. When they started moving toward an alliance with the liberal capitalists, Trotsky broke with them and began to move in the direction of the Bolsheviks, who were as hostile to such an alliance as he was.
But his return to Lenin’s side was delayed by a number of complications. For one thing, Trotsky developed the theory of the permanent revolution, which forecast that a revolution against Czarism would quickly be turned into a workers revolution that would lead to the establishment of a working class government faced with socialist tasks. It took some years for even Lenin to grasp the correctness of this daring conception, although it was not a basic conflict with his own.
Another complication was that the Mensheviks vacillated back and forth between the perspectives of revolution and reform, especially under the impact of the 1905 revolution. This led to numerous proposals for reuniting the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, which at times Lenin himself supported, and which was actually tried unsuccessfully. Trotsky, although moving closer to the Bolsheviks politically, favored unification of the two groups and worked for it until 1912 in the belief that the revolutionary wing would be predominant in a united party.
 
Historic context
In the light of everything he stood and fought for from 1917 on, Trotsky’s conciliationist efforts are hard to understand today unless they are examined in their historic context. Lenin had begun to build a new kind of party, whose like had never existed before, a revolutionary combat party fit to lead the workers in taking power. His genius was proved in 1917, when his party fulfilled precisely the mission it had set itself. But it should not be too surprising that other great Marxists, lacking historic working class models to base them selves on, at first mistook the meaning and purpose of Lenin’s pioneering work.
When World War I began, Trotsky realized that it would be wrong in principle as well as impossible to unite the pro-war Mensheviks and the anti-war Bolsheviks. On his return to revolutionary Russia in 1917, he found himself and Lenin in complete agreement on the tasks of the revolution; he also saw now that Lenin’s ideas on revolutionary organization had been completely confirmed by the test of events, and that the Bolsheviks were the only revolutionary party in the country.
He then became a Bolshevik in heart, mind and soul, played a role in the Bolshevik leadership of the revolution second only to Lenin’s, and defended Bolshevism to his dying day.
 
Trotsky’s answer
After Lenin’s death the Stalinists launched their big slander campaign by quoting Trotsky’s pre-1917 polemics against Lenin to prove that he had never really been, a Bolshevik. Trotsky’s answer was not to “blur” the differences, as Deutscher claims, but to present them in their proper perspective.
Trotsky neither concealed nor denied his early differences with Lenin. He stated what they had been and explained them. Distinguishing between those of his differences with Lenin which had been serious and genuine and those which had been episodic and due partly to misunderstandings  on both sides, he admitted where he had been wrong and why (such as in his criticism of Lenin’s organizational principles and in his efforts to reunite the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks) and defended the positions on which he had been correct (such as his theory of the permanent revolution, which Lenin accepted in action in 1917).
That is, he examined his relations with Lenin in their totality, and assigned the different parts of their proper sphere and rank. Objectively viewed, the earlier disagreements were far outweighed by the later agreements. If this was not the case, the agreements could never have taken place. The subordinate, transitory character of the disagreements was demonstrated by everything that happened later, including the close and loyal collaboration between Trotsky and Lenin from 1917 on. Lenin himself testified to this by observing that no one had been a better Bolshevik than Trotsky after he joined.
 
Deutscher’s view
Deutscher, however, is not satisfied with this method or this evaluation, although he does not challenge it directly and in places even pays lip-service to it. In the guise of objective historian he devotes a great deal of space to the early differences &8211; as much space, or more, as he gives to the later agreements between Trotsky and Lenin. The result is to make the differences and the agreements assume an equal importance on the historical scale.
We all know that it is possible to tell a lie while using strictly truthful words, depending on the tone, the arrangement of the words, the words omitted, etc. In the same way Deutscher, even if everything he writes on the differences is factually correct, lends himself to what can only be called a historical distortion &8211; the kind which the Stalinists, who dislike Deutscher on other grounds, can only welcome.
In part, as we have explained, Deutscher does this in an effort to establish his superior “objectivity” over Trotsky. But there is another and more important reason &8211; a political reason &8211; for the emphasis he puts on Trotsky’s early differences with Bolshevism.
And that is the fact that he obviously half-sympathizes with the criticism of Bolshevism that Trotsky later rejected and attacked.
 
His own sympathies
Naturally Deutscher doesn’t express his sympathies openly and honestly. No, he suggests indirectly to the reader what he finds inconvenient to state directly. But the suggestions are unmistakable. Trotsky’s polemics against Bolshevism are evaluated by Deutscher as “Acute and venomous,” as an “odd ... assortment of great ideas and petty polemical tricks, of subtle historical insights and fustian flourishes,” as “the faithful mirror of the future,” etc. He says the 1903 controversy “at its more advanced stage will become one of the major motifs” of the book; in fact, it is the major theme.
Now let’s examine that part of Trotsky’s polemics against Lenin which Deutscher regards as acute, great, subtle, a faithful mirror and so on. It is all summed up in a single sentence, written by Trotsky in 1904 in a pamphlet, Our Political Tasks, which reads as follows:
”Lenin’s methods lead to this; the party organization (the caucus) at first substitutes itself for the party as a whole; then the Central Committee substitutes itself for the organization; and finally a single ’dictator’ substitutes himself for the Central Committee.”
Out of the millions of words Trotsky wrote in 40 years of steady literary output, this is the favorite sentence of all the renegades and opponents of Bolshevism, and they naturally use it against Trotsky as well as Lenin. Deutscher too is so fond of this sentence that he recurs to it repeatedly and uses it for the climax and conclusion on his last page.
 
The 1904 prediction
The 24-year old Trotsky, he marvels, “predicted” the post-revolution degeneration of the Bolshevik party with “uncanny clearsightedness,” his chief error being that it was Stalin (unknown in 1904) and not Lenin who became dictator over the party. The obvious implication here is that Trotsky should have stuck by his 1904 prediction instead of turning around and becoming a Bolshevik himself.
The trouble with this prediction was that it too was guilty of a form of “substitutism.” It sought to foresee the development of the Bolshevik party solely in abstract terms of its internal organizational procedures, to the neglect of the much more decisive effects on the party of concrete social-political developments in the class struggles outside the party.
The Bolshevik party did not degenerate after the revolution because Lenin had molded it into a highly disciplined organization &8211; in fact, the revolution would never have taken place unless he had done that &8211; but because the revolution, instead of being extended from Russia to the more industrially developed countries of Europe, was defeated in the years after World War I (with the aid of the treacherous Social Democrats) and confined to an economically and cultural weak and backward country.
If the revolution had been extended (and it would have been extended if the revolutionists in Germany and elsewhere had built in advance precisely the kind of party Lenin built in Russia), if the Soviet Union had been able to link its economy with that of more advanced countries, then the relation of forces inside the Bolshevik party would have been different, the party would have been able to escape or overcome the Stalinist degeneration, and it would have continued to function in the Same healthy democratic-centralist fashion that it did in its best and most creative years.
 
The differences
Thanks to his growing mastery of the Marxist method of analysis and to his own enlightening experience with the Bolsheviks, Trotsky came to see the inadequacy, narrowness and, abstractness of his 1904 prediction. He rejected it totally and fought untiringly against all the opponents of Marxism who sought to explain the degeneration of the Bolshevik party by its adoption of Lenin’s correct organizational principles rather than by the complex historical process that unfolded and crushed the party in the years of reaction after the revolution.
But Deutscher, in his own sly way, tries to patch up one of the main crutches in the arsenal of anti-Bolshevism. The difference between the writings of Trotsky and Deutscher is not only that Trotsky acts openly while Deutscher operates by innuendo, but that Trotsky defends Bolshevism while Deutscher seeks to discredit it. Further proof will be supplied in future articles.

Trotsky’s Story – Tragedy or Triumph
(3 May 1954)

(Last of a series)
By executing some fast shuffles, as we showed in the previous article in this series, Isaac Deutscher reaches the conclusion in his book, The Prophet Armed, that Trotsky and Lenin set political and theoretical “precedents” that “paved the way” for Stalin. He also expresses “absorbing interest” in the question: to what extent did Trotsky “pave the way for Stalin” by “his own character”?
Since this volume does not deal with the period of Trotsky’s struggle against Stalinism, Deutscher doesn’t answer his own question fully here. But he makes some beginnings, throwing out hints about Trotsky’s character that have already been eagerly snapped up by, reviewers who reduce everything to their own shallow level, find in the most profound social struggles a pretext to indulge in amateur psychoanalysis, and glibly explain the course of Soviet history by alleged “defects” in Trotsky’s personality.
Deutscher, of course, is much too shrewd to go that far himself. Elsewhere he has quoted approvingly Plekhanov’s statement:
“Owing to the specific qualities of their minds and characters, influential individuals can change the individual features of events and some of their particular consequences, but they cannot change their general trend, which is determined by other forces.”
Deutscher knows, and will say, that it was “other forces” (social, political, economic) that determined the victory of Stalin. He knows that Stalin won, not because he was more sociable and humble than Trotsky, but because he represented social forces in retreat and in reaction against the revolution (and because his was a character that could adapt to and express those forces, while Trotsky’s character couldn’t and didn’t).
But while Deutscher knows all this, he cannot refrain from making certain criticism of Trotsky’s character which we want to discuss briefly, not because they are new, but because they are genuinely related to Trotsky’s role.
 
Ideas and men
(1) As far back as 1904, Deutscher says, Trotsky “exhibited a characteristic of which he would never quite free himself: he could not separate ideas from men.”
The real substance of this stock complaint against Trotsky was that he took a serious attitude to serious ideas because he knew they are the indispensable bedrock for any party aspiring to lead a workers revolution. In other words, he was a principled politician &8211; without deviation from 1917 &8211; who put program ahead of all other considerations. He worked loyally with people when he found himself in political agreement with them, and did not hesitate to break and fight against even former friends after their political paths parted.
This characteristic offended and repelled centrists, vacillators and political dabblers; to people who were always ready to patch up, compromise or ignore basic differences in order to cement a “practical” bloc, Trotsky’s insistence on principles seemed “unworldly,” “harsh,” “sectarian” or “autocratic” (epithets which were all applied to Lenin and to Marx too). But far from being a fault, this was one of Trotsky’s greatest virtues. Instead of hampering him, it saved him.
 
Zinoviev and Kamenev
Zinoviev and Kamenev were Bolsheviks too. But after Lenin’s death they thrust principles to the side and set out to be “practical” politicians, figuring that first they would combine with Stalin to get power and then later would decide on the ends that power would serve. They separated, that is subordinated, ideas to their bloc with Stalin, and this proved to be their undoing. For they found themselves serving ends they had never dreamed of, and when they tried to draw back, it was too late &8211; Stalin had the power. Their reward was political degradation, to say nothing of bullets in the back of the head.
Trotsky too was approached by Stalin for a bloc. But he could not and would not separate Stalin from the ideas and forces he represented, and he rejected the offer. He saved himself as a revolutionist and was able to make further contributions to the movement precisely because his character inclined him to, and his experience increasingly confirmed him in, principled politics.
 
Out of his element?
(2) Deutscher writes: “Trotsky’s strength, Stalin said, reveals itself when the revolution gains momentum and advances; his weakness comes to the fore when the revolution is defeated and must retreat. There is some truth in this. Trotsky’s mental and moral constitution was such that he received the strongest impulses from, and best mobilized his resources amid, the strains and stresses of actual upheaval. On a gigantic stage, which dwarfed others, he rose to the giant’s stature... When the revolution was on the wane, however, he was out of his element and his strength sagged. He was equal to herculean, not to lesser, labors.”
There is “some” truth in this &8211; this much: In periods of revolutionary upsurge, great leaders always shine most brightly &8211; after all, that is what they have been living, working and preparing for. In periods of reaction and defeat, even the best of leaders are, so to speak, out of their element, thrown on the defensive, reduced to different labors.
Trotsky stood out among men in 1905 and 1917 because he so accurately reflected the revolutionary moods and hopes of the masses. He did not and could not play the same role in the periods of reaction that followed these two revolutions. But we must distinguish &8211; for he did not play the same kind of role in both these periods of reaction either.
 
Role in two periods
After 1905, when so many revolutionists became demoralized and deserted, Trotsky stuck to his revolutionary guns and, as Deutscher admits, “went on expounding the idea of permanent revolution with an optimism and ardor uncommon in those years of depression.” But as Trotsky wrote later in In Defense of Marxism: 
”I bad not freed myself at that period especially in the organizational sphere from the traits of a petty-bourgeois revolutionist. I was sick with the disease of conciliationism toward Menshevism and with a distrustful attitude toward Leninist centralism.”
Consequently Trotsky, then still pursuing the illusion of uniting the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, was largely isolated from 1906 to 1917. In this pursuit he certainly was out of his element, and he did not fully come into it until 1917 when he became a Bolshevik.
It will be noted that Trotsky explains his isolation at this time mainly by political reasons, while Deutscher emphasizes mainly personal traits.. The correctness of Trotsky’s explanation is confirmed by the role he played from 1923 on.
The wave of reaction that struck Russia after 1923 was deeper and longer than anything living men and women had  ever  experienced. The persecution and terror visited on the Trotskyist opposition was more severe than in the worst days of the Czarist reaction after 1905. Bolsheviks who had not flinched at jail, Siberia or exile in 1906 were broken morally and capitulated to Stalin in 1926. What did Trotsky do?
(3) This is the subject of Deutscher’s next book, but in this one he expresses approval for the statement that “it was Trotsky’s major weakness that he did not persist in his wisdom, especially when to be wise was to be alone.” (Our emphasis.)
This statement alone, in our opinion, is sufficient to disqualify Deutscher as any objective judge of Trotsky the man and his work.
Against all odds, Trotsky stood up against the fierce reaction represented by Stalinism. He stood up and fought back in defense of Bolshevism. He resisted all the pressures, spurned all the offers for compromise, refused to yield an inch on principle. He did this virtually alone, against practically the whole leadership of the party, who held the state power in their hands and did not hesitate to use its coercive instruments. If anyone in the history of the revolutionary movement “persisted,” it was Trotsky, whom Stalin could neither bribe nor beat into line.
This was not Trotsky’s natural “element.” But his strength did not “sag” at the prospect, This was not actually a “lesser labor” than leading a revolution &8211; it was merely a different, harder and less personally gratifying labor. But Trotsky was equal to it, and he mobilized all his resources to carry it through to the finish.
 
Trotsky’s triumph
To Deutscher, Trotsky’s story is “tragic.” That only shows how little he understands. Trotsky, it is true, was expelled, exiled and finally murdered, but standing high above all these personal reverses, which Trotsky had foreseen was that greater triumph which he snatched from Stalin’s hands by discharging his revolutionary duty to the full.
Stalin’s aim was to exterminate Bolshevism root and branch. In this he was thwarted. For Trotsky, almost singlehanded, kept the banner of Bolshevism aloft and preserved it from stain; he maintained the continuity of revolutionary Marxism; he gathered together as new cadre and armed it and hardened it. Lenin’s great achievement was to organize Bolshevism; Trotsky’s was to preserve it in its most difficult days.
When the balance is struck, we believe, history will recognize as Trotsky’s greatest achievement not the role he played in the Russian revolution in 1917, outstanding as that was, when all the conditions favored revolutionary activity, but the role he filled in the reactionary years from 1923 to 1940 in patiently explaining the meaning of Stalinism and tirelessly recruiting the forces of the Fourth International who will lead the workers in ridding the world of both capitalism and Stalinism.
A Deutscher couldn’t understand that. He’s too busy searching for the “revolutionary” sides of Stalinism, and for signs that the Soviet bureaucracy is going to reform itself, to be able to recognize the real path of socialist revolution in  our time or the magnitude of Trotsky’s work in clearing that path for the revolutionist of today and tomorrow.
* * *
It would be wrong, however, to conclude without some remarks about positive aspects of the book. For one thing, Deutscher has done a lot of research, particularly in the earlier writings of Trotsky &8211; literary and cultural criticism, war correspondence, etc. &8211; and he quotes enough from them to make his book worth reading. And to increase our appetite. When is some publisher going to be astute enough to get these writings translated?
For another thing, the book has many anecdotes and sidelights that will appeal to readers already familiar with Trotsky’s works. For example, Trotsky’s autobiography merely records in a phrase the fact that the police arrested the Petersburg Soviet which he headed in December, 1905; Deutscher devotes two pages to the amusing details. Trotsky spent only a few lines on the subsequent trial of its leaders; Deutscher has six pages highlighting the dramatic events.
But for a genuinely objective account of Russian revolutionary history, and for an account that can serve as a guide to people who want to participate in revolutionary politics, we repeat, the reader will still have to turn to Trotsky’s own writings, for which there is still no substitute.

e Breitman: An ’Objective’ Biographer ’Restores’ Leon Trotsky (March 1954)       Breitman Archive    |    Trotskyist Writers Index   |    ETOL Main Page  George Breitman An ’Objective’ Biographer ‘Restores’ Leon Trotsky (5 April 1954)  From The Militant, Vol. 18 No. 13, 29 March 1954.Transcribed & marked up by Martin Fahlgren for the  Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL) in 2012. Copyleft: Leon Trotsky Internet Archive (www.marxists.org) 2012. Permission is granted to copy and/or distribute this document under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0.  In the preface to his new book, The Prophet Armed, Isaac Deutscher undertakes to explain why he wrote the biography of Leon Trotsky, of which this volume is the first half. ”For nearly thirty years,” he says, “the powerful propaganda machines of Stalinism worked furiously to expunge Trotsky’s name from the annals of the revolution, or to leave it there only as the synonym for arch-traitor ... The work of the tomb-robbers has, in this present instance, been so persistent that  it has strongly affected the views even of independent Western historians and scholars.” To counteract the lies of Stalinism and the neglect of Western historians &8211; this is indeed a worthy and commendable aim. But there are many ways of accomplishing it. One way would be to reprint the many works of Trotsky himself, including his autobiography, and to get printed in English for the first time his many works, that have never been translated. After all, Trotsky was among other things a literary genius. Couldn’t Deutscher have prevailed on some publisher to do this, and couldn’t he have used his influence as a “Russian expert” to start a campaign along these lines, even perhaps a money-raising program for such publication? Whether such a thought  ever occurred to him, Deutscher does not say. But he admits to feeling a trifle “apologetic” for covering material that Trotsky himself wrote about so voluminously, “for after a close and critical examination I still find Trotsky’s My Life as scrupulously truthful as any work of this kind can be. Nevertheless ...” (This is Deutscher’s favorite technique: every statement that can be construed as favorable must be followed at once, wherever possible, by a “Nevertheless” or a “But.” That is the very essence of “objectivity” in the eyes of his liberal admirers.) “Nevertheless, it remains an apologia produced in the middle of the losing battle its author fought against Stalin.” An “apologia” – that sounds bad, not the kind of thing any self-respecting “objective” person writes. Furthermore, an apologia produced in the middle of a battle in which the author was involved. That also doesn’t sound too good &8211; everyone knows how hard it is to avoid subjectivity in the middle of a life-and-death battle &8211; and detracts considerably from the favorable effect of the admission that Trotsky was scrupulously truthful in his autobiography. “In its pages,” Deutscher continues, “the living Trotsky wrestled with his tomb-robbers. To wholesale Stalinist denigration he responded with a peculiar act of self-defense which savored of self-glorification.” We will return in a short while to the “self-glorification” charge, although we must admit that we have been utterly unable to figure out what “peculiar act” Deutscher is talking about. Anyhow, his next lines are: “He did not and could not satisfactorily explain the change in the climate of the revolution which made his defeat both possible and inevitable; and his account of the intrigues by which a narrow-minded, ‘usurpatory’, and malignant bureaucracy ousted him from power is obviously inadequate.” Here we must pause to examine another of Deutscher’s cute little tricks. Trotsky, he says, didn’t and couldn’t explain why Stalinism triumphed. Is that true? No, it is one of the biggest falsehoods of the year. Then how could Deutscher hope to get away with it? Because he is very cleverly referring to My Life, written in 1929, and expecting that most readers will take it to be a reference to all of Trotsky’s writings. Trotsky began the explanation in the 1920’s, that is, when Stalinism was coming to power in the Bolshevik party, and part of it is contained in My Life. Then Trotsky continued and completed the job of uncovering the international and domestic social, economic and political causes for the rise and victory of Stalinism in several of the most important of his books during the next eleven years. Here we need cite only The Revolution Betrayed, Stalin, and In Defense of Marxism. No one in the whole wide world did more than Trotsky to clarify the Soviet degeneration; this was one of his greatest contributions to Marxist theory. Deutscher himself unwittingly testifies to this fact on almost every page he writes, for almost everything he writes on this subject is borrowed from Trotsky’s analysis (a stronger word than “borrowed” could be used because he usually borrows without giving credit to the: source) &8211; so much so, that he is sometimes mistaken for a “Trotskyist” by uncritical readers who do not realize that he bowdlerizes and distorts most of what he borrows so that it will serve his anti-Trotskyist purposes. Deutscher, we repeat, adds nothing or nothing of value to Trotsky’s analysis, but he is not above using a device to make it appear that he, Deutscher, supplying the theoretical explanations that Trotsky “did not and could not” satisfactorily make. (The Stalinists, as we can see, are not the only ones in the tomb-robbing business. But at least they don’t make the pretense of “restoring” Trotsky’s reputation.) His critique continues: “In My Life Trotsky sought to vindicate himself in terms imposed upon him by Stalin and by the whole ideological situation of Bolshevism in the 1920s, that is in terms of the Lenin cult. Stalin had denounced him as Lenin’s inveterate enemy, and Trotsky was consequently anxious to prove his complete devotion to, and his agreement with, Lenin. His devotion to Lenin after 1917 was undoubtedly genuine, and the points of agreement between them were numerous and important. Nevertheless ...” In other words, Trotsky, who was a Leninist from 1917 on, and the outstanding defender of Bolshevism from Lenin’s death to his own, refuted Stalin’s lies by telling the plain truth. After Trotsky became a Bolshevik, he regarded Lenin as his comrade, teacher and leader, and acted accordingly. He never was a hand-raiser, and he had no more use for cults than Lenin had. He generally reached the same conclusions as Lenin during their six years of collaboration in the Soviet leadership, because they had a common approach to problems; when in the course of discussion they differed, Trotsky the not hesitate to express his opinions frankly in the Bolshevik tradition. He never concealed the truth about his differences with Lenin before 1917, or after; they are there in black and white for everyone to read in his books. ”Nevertheless, Trotsky blurred the sharp outlines and the importance of his controversies with Lenin between 1903 and 1917, and also of later differences.” By this Deutscher really means that he and Trotsky have different evaluations of the significance of Trotsky’s differences with Lenin. What those differences are, whose evaluation is correct and the political meaning of Deutscher’s evaluation will be dealt with in next week’s article. “But,” he continues, “another and much stranger consequence of the fact that Trotsky made his apologia in terms of the Lenin cult was that in some crucial points he belittled his own role in comparison with Lenin’s, a feat extremely rare in autobiographical literature. This applies especially to the account of the part he played in the October uprising and the creation of the Red Army, where he detracted from his awn merits in order not to appear as Lenin’s detractor, Free from loyalties to any cult, I have attempted to restore the historical balance.” Thus Trotsky, accused on the previous page of some unnamed “peculiar act of self-defense which savored of self-glorification,” is here indicted for the opposite sin of belittling himself. How fortunate the modern age is in having this even-handed dispenser of justice to set Trotsky straight on both these distortions! After this shocking exposure, in which Trotsky is caught, red-handed and barefaced, actually attributing the first place in the leadership of the Russian revolution to Lenin (just as Engels attributed the primary in their collaboration to Marx), how can anyone doubt any longer that Deutscher is more “objective” than Trotsky? And how can anyone now doubt that Deutscher was driven to write this book by the stern necessities of historical balance?  Free from what? But amusement over these ludicrous pretensions should not lead us to overlook the serious side of Deutscher’s preface &8211; namely, his assertion of freedom from “loyalties to any cult,” including “the Lenin cult.” In his book on Stalin, Deutscher also used this expression, “the Lenin cult.” In the context there it referred to Stalin’s disloyal, factional misuse of Lenin’s mantle to silence and crush the opponents of Stalinism. Understood in this sense &8211; as the Stalinist perversion of Leninism – the term was not wholly objectionable. But now Deutscher seems to be giving it a broader meaning (or maybe he is only explaining the meaning he originally had in mind) when he uses the term against Trotsky as well as Stalin. Since Trotsky was genuinely a Leninist, and not one who twisted quotations from Lenin to mask an anti-Leninist policy, Deutscher’s declaration of independence from “the Lenin cult” must be understood as his declaration of independence from Leninism itself. This judgment is supported by many other passages in the book, and we will return to it in a future article. Up to now Deutscher has been careful not to state explicitly the standpoint from which he approaches his trilogy and, so far as we know, he has not answered anywhere the stupid claims of stupid reviewers that he is a “Leninist” or “Trotskyist.” His present declaration is useful because it helps the reader in “placing” Deutscher’s true standpoint. This is a matter not only of historical but also of current political importance. Deutscher’s books can be better understood if we bear in mind that right now, while the struggle against the Stalinist perversion of Leninism is still being waged in and out of the Soviet Union, Deutscher declares his freedom of all “cults,” that is, of all groups engaged in the struggle, including the Leninists.

 Deutscher Worthless as Guide to Action
(Spring 1954)

From The Militant, Vol. 18 No. 15, 12 April 1954.

In the fall of 1917 the Bolsheviks began to discuss whether or not to organize an uprising to turn all power over to the Soviets. Lenin and Trotsky favored the uprising and pushed for it Zinoviev and Kamenev, frightened and doubtful, drew back and opposed it.
”Regardless of its immediate conclusion, history has perhaps not said the last word” on this historic argument, says Isaac Deutscher in his biography of Trotsky: The Prophet Armed. “After the event, it is easy and natural to say that the advocates, of the insurrection were right, and its opponents wrong. In truth; each side presented its case in such a way that the rights were strangely blended with the wrongs and the realistic assessment of historical prospects was offset by momentous errors.”
Lenin and Trotsky, he judges, were right in estimating that the insurrection would be easily accomplished, and Zinoviev and Kamenev were wrong in foreseeing a disastrous adventure. But on the other hand, among the chief motivations of Lenin and Trotsky was their belief in the imminence of the European revolution, which they predicted and expected and looked to for support in their own revolution. Zinoviev and Kamenev, Deutscher pays, correctly scoffed at this contention as a harmful exaggeration.
 
”It may be wondered”
As any fool knows, the European revolution did not take place during or after World War 1. And Deutscher, who knows it too, sums up the situation this way:
”Thus those who were supreme realists When summing up the Russian situation (Lenin and Trotsky) became illusionists when they turned towards the broader international scene, and those who saw Russia only dimly through a mist of timid skepticism (Zinoviev and Kamenev) became then the realists ... it may be wondered whether Lenin and Trotsky would have acted as they did, or whether they would have acted with the same determination, if they had taken a soberer view of international revolution and foreseen that in the course of decades their example would not be imitated in, any other country.”
Deutscher, at any rate, is still wondering about it. Being “sober” himself, and not an “illusionist” like Lenin and Trotsky, isn’t it fairly safe to conclude that if the decision had been up to him, the Russian revolution would not have taken place?
We mention this because it illustrates, the difference between the “objective” bystander commentator and the active revolutionary  fighter. To Deutscher the Bolshevik attitude toward European revolution in 1917 and later was “the great illusion,” “a veil of dreams and fantasy” whose “frustration was subsequently to break and crush” Trotsky, etc. Hindsight makes Deutscher look awfully smart.
 
Didn’t merely predict 
But for Lenin and Trotsky, European revolution was neither an academic question nor the theme of a few pages in a book. For them it was an aim. They didn’t merely predict a European revolution &8211; they worked for it, conducted all their diplomacy to facilitate it, used all their resources to promote it. Zinoviev and the other skeptics, including the Russian Deutschers, could do nothing to speed the European revolution they did not believe could happen; Lenin and Trotsky did everything that was possible.
Was the prospect of a European revolution a fantasy in 1917? The capitalist rulers of Europe did not consider it fantastic a year or two later; the armies of counter-revolutionary intervention they sent to Soviet Russia were intended to crush the revolution before it would spread to other countries, as they “soberly” expected it to do. Was the German revolution of 1918 a fantasy? Or the revolutionary situations in Germany in 1919, in 1921, in 1923, to say nothing of the postwar collapse of capitalist governments in other European countries?
 
How they viewed it
In addition to expecting the European revolution, Lenin and Trotsky viewed the question as one that settled in action, in the class struggle. That’s what actually happened. The revolutionary situation they forsaw in Europe broke out at the end of the war, and they tried by their example, and whatever aid they could extend, to help transform those revolutionary situations into successful revolutions.
It is true that these revolutions which threatened, and some of which began, were defeated. But guarantees of victory are seldom available on the eve of revolutionary struggles; and even when proffered should not be accepted as final; such questions are settled only in the struggle. The revolutionary optimism of Lenin and Trotsky and, even more, their revolutionary activity were, from the viewpoint of socialism and the working class, a thousand times more correct, productive and realistic than the doubts and abstentionism of their faint-hearted critics.
Their policy destroyed capitalism in Russia, shook European capitalism so badly that counterrevolutionary intervention against Soviet Russia after World War I was paralyzed, and created conditions which led to the abolition of capitalism in other countries during and after World War II. The policy of their opponents, in which Deutscher is still looking for merits in 1954, would have been disastrous to everyone but the capitalists.
 
On the Comintern
If Deutscher is still wondering about the 1917 uprising in. Russia, he has no such doubts about the formation of the revolutionary Communist International in 1919. The whole business was an egregious error to him.
The error, as he sees it, flows again from the Bolsheviks’ simple-minded misreading of the European situation at the end of the war. They just couldn’t get it into their thick heads that there wasn’t going to be a successful revolution outside of Russia. Anyhow, Lenin called an international conference in Moscow in 1919, “either to proclaim the Third International or to make preliminary arrangements for this.”
The Bolsheviks, according to Deutscher, wanted to set up the International at once but awaited the opinions of the other delegates before making a decision. The German delegates said it was too soon to  form an. International &8211; they were still too weak. But an Austrian delegate, who arrived in the middle of the debate, “gave a startling description of Europe  seething with revolution.” That settled it:
”Thus, fathered by wish, mothered by confusion, and assisted by accident, the great institution came into being.”
 
”It is doubtful”
Deutscher’s sympathies are clearly with the German delegates who wanted to wait:
“It is doubtful whether Lenin and Trotsky would have founded the International at this stage if they had had a clearer perception of the condition of Europe.” (But there is nothing doubtful about the outcome if Deutscher had cast the deciding ballot.)
”Nothing,” he assures us, “had been further from (their) thoughts than the intention of giving an assortment of small political sects the high-sounding label of the International.” (Deutscher, who prides himself on his unique ability to count although he neglects to indicate exactly how big an organization must be before he will consent to dignify it with the label of International, here telegraphs the attitude that he is going to express in his next book toward the formation of the Fourth International by Trotsky in 1938.)
And yet, one page later, Deutscher tells us calmly: “Even their expectations were not altogether groundless; within a year the new International did, in fact, gain a formidable hold on the European labor movement.”
How it could have Alone so without having been formed year before, Deutscher does not explain.
Strangely enough, the “confusion” of the Bolsheviks is demonstrated in real life to be the best and most effective kind of revolutionary realism, and the “objective” Deutscher, for all his hindsight, is shown to be a rather worthless guide to any reader interested in participating in revolutionary politics.

IT IS now common knowledge even among conservative circles in the labor movement that race prejudice benefits the interests of the capitalist class and injures the interests of the working class. What is not well known – it still comes as a surprise to many Marxists – and should be made better known is the fact that race prejudice is a uniquely capitalist phenomenon, which either did not exist or had no perceptible influence in pre-capitalist society (that is, before the sixteenth century).
Hundreds of modern scholars have traced anti-Negro prejudice (to take the most important and prevalent type of race prejudice in the United States) back to the African slave trade and the slave system that was introduced into the Americas. Those who profited from the enslavement of the Negroes – the slave traders and merchant capitalists first of Europe and then of America, and the slaveholders – required a rationalization and a moral justification for an archaic social institution that obviously flouted the relatively enlightened principles proclaimed by capitalist society in its struggle against feudalism. Rationalizations always become available when powerful economic interests need them (that is how most politicians and preachers, editors and teachers earn their living) and in this case the theory that Negroes are “inferior” followed close on the discovery that Negro slavery was exceptionally profitable.
This theory was embraced, fitted out with pseudo-scientific trappings and Biblical quotations, and trumpeted forth as a truth so self-evident that only madmen or subversives could doubt or deny it. Its influence on the minds of men was great at all levels of society, and undoubtedly aided the slaveholders in retarding the abolition of slavery. But with the growth of the productive forces, economic interests hostile to the slaveholders brought forth new theories and ideas, and challenged the supremacy of the slaveholders on all fronts, including ideology. The ensuing class struggles – between the capitalists, slaves, workers and farmers on one side and the slaveholders on the other – resulted in the destruction of the slave system.
But if anti-Negro prejudices and ideas arose out of the need to justify and maintain slavery, why didn’t they wither away after slavery was abolished? In the first place, ideas, although they must reflect broad material interests before they can achieve wide circulation, can live lives of their own once they are set into motion, and can survive for a time after the disappearance of the conditions that produced them. (It is instructive to note, for example, that Lincoln did not free himself wholly of race prejudice and continued to believe in the “inferiority” of the Negro even while he was engaged in prosecuting the civil war that abolished the slave system – a striking illustration both of the tendency of ideas to lag behind events and of the primacy of material interest over ideology.)
This is a generalization, however, and does not provide the main explanation for the survival of anti-Negro prejudice after the Civil War. For the striking thing about the Reconstruction period which followed the abolition of slavery was the speed with which old ideas and customs began to change and break up. In the course of a few short years millions of whites began to recover from the racist poisons to which they had been subjected from their birth, to regard Negroes as equals and to work together with them amicably, under the protection of the federal government, in the solution of joint problems. The obliteration of anti-Negro prejudice was started in the social revolution that we know by the name of Reconstruction, and it would have been completed if Reconstruction had been permitted to develop further.





But Reconstruction was halted and then strangled – by the capitalists, acting now in alliance with the former slaveholders. No exploiting class lightly discards weapons that can help maintain its rule, and anti-Negro prejudice had already demonstrated its potency as a force to divide, disrupt and disorient oppressed classes in an exploitative society .After some vacillation and internal struggle that lasted through most of Reconstruction, the capitalist class decided it could make use of anti-Negro prejudice for its own purposes. The capitalists adopted it, nursed it, fed it, gave it new clothing, and infused it with a vigor and an influence it had never commanded before. Anti-Negro prejudice today operates in a different social setting and therefore in a somewhat different form than a century ago, but it was retained after slavery for essentially the same reason that it was introduced under the slave system that developed from the sixteenth century on – for its convenience as an instrument of exploitation; and for that same reason it will not be abandoned by the ruling class of any exploitative society in this country.
But why do we speak of the introduction of anti-Negro prejudice in the slave system, whose spread coincided with the birth of capitalism? Wasn’t there slavery long centuries before capitalism? Didn’t race prejudice exist in the earlier slave societies? Why designate race prejudice as a uniquely capitalist phenomenon? A brief look at slavery of both the capitalist and pre-capitalist periods can lead us to the answers.
Capitalism, the social system that followed and replaced feudalism, owed its rise to world dominance in part to its revival or expansion of forms of exploitation originally developed in the pre-feudal slave societies, and to its adaptation and integration of those forms into the framework of capitalist productive relations. As “the chief momenta of primitive accumulation” through which the early capitalists gathered together the capital necessary to establish and spread the new system, Marx listed “the discovery of gold and silver in America, the extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population, the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East Indies, the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black skins.” The African slave trade and slavery produced fortunes that laid the foundations for the most important of the early industries of capitalism, which in turn served to revolutionize the economy of the whole world.
Thus we see, side by side, in clear operation of the laws of uneven and combined development, archaic pre-feudal forms and the most advanced social relations then possible in the post-feudal world. The former were of course in the service of the latter, at least during the first stages of their co-existence. This was not a mere repetition of the slavery of ancient times: one basic economic difference was that the slave system of the Americas produced commodities for the world capitalist market, and was therefore subordinate to and dependent on that market. There were other differences, but here we confine ourselves to the one most relevant to the subject of this article – race relations in the early slave societies.
For the information that follows we are indebted to the writings of an anthropologist and of a sociologist: Ina Corinne Brown, Socio-Economic Approach to Educational Problems, 1942, chapter 2 (this government publication, the first volume in the National Survey of the Higher Education of Negroes sponsored, by the US Office of Education, is now out of print, but the same material is covered in her book. Race Relations in a Democracy, 1949, chapter 4); and Oliver C. Cox, Caste, Class, and Race, 1948, chapter 16. [1] Dr. Cox’s treatment is fuller; he also has been more influenced by Marx.
This is what they write about the ancient Egyptians:
So many persons assume that racial antipathy is a natural or instinctive reaction that it is important to emphasize the fact that race prejudice such as we know did not exist before the modern age. To be sure there was group antipathy which those who read history backwards take to be race prejudice, but actually this antipathy had little or nothing to do with color or the other physical differences by which races are distinguished. For example, the ancient Egyptians looked down upon the Negroes to the south of them. They enslaved these Negroes and spoke scornfully of them. Many writers, reading later racial attitudes into the situation, have seen in this scorn a color prejudice. But the Egyptians were just as scornful of the Asiatic sand dwellers, or Troglodytes as Herodotus called them, and of their other neighbors who were as light or lighter than the Egyptians. The Egyptian artists caricature the wretched captives taken in the frequent wars, but they emphasize the hooked noses of the Hittites, the woolen garments of the Hebrews, and the peculiar dress of the Libyans quite as much as the color or the thick lips of the Negroes. That the Egyptians mixed freely with their southern neighbors, either in slavery or out of it, is evidenced by the fact that some of the Pharaohs were obviously Negroid and eventually Egypt was ruled by an Ethiopian dynasty. (Brown, 1942)
There seems to be no basis for imputing racial antagonism to the Egyptians, Babylonians, or Persians. (Cox)
On the Greeks:
One frequently finds mention of the scornful way in which Negro slaves were referred to in Greece and Rome, but the fact is that equally scornful remarks were made of the white slaves from the North and the East. There seems to be no evidence that color antipathy was involved, and of the total slave population the Negroes constituted only a minor element. (Brown, 1942)
The slave population was enormous, but the slave and the master in Greece were commonly of the same race and there was no occasion to associate any given physical type with the slave status. An opponent of Athenian democracy complained that it was impossible in Athens to distinguish slaves and aliens from citizens because all classes dressed alike and lived in the same way. (Brown, 1949.)
... we do not find race prejudice even in the great Hellenistic empire which extended deeper into the territories of colored people than any other European empire up to the end of the fifteenth century.
The Hellenic Greeks had a cultural, not a racial, standard of belonging, so that their basic division of the peoples of the world were Greeks and barbarians – the barbarians having been all those persons who did not possess the Greek culture, especially its language ... the people of the Greek city-states, who founded colonies among the barbarians on the shores of the Black Sea and of the Mediterranean, welcomed those barbarians to the extent that they were able to participate in Greek culture, and intermarried freely with them. The Greeks knew that they had a superior culture to those of the barbarians, but they included Europeans, Africans, and Asiatics in the concept Hellas as these peoples acquired a working knowledge of the Greek culture.
The experience of the later Hellenistic empire of Alexander tended to be the direct contrary of modern racial antagonism. The narrow patriotism of the city-states was given up for a new cosmopolitanism. Every effort was made to assimilate the barbarians to Greek culture, and in the process a new Greco-Oriental culture with a Greco-Oriental ruling class came into being. Alexander himself took a Persian princess for his wife and encouraged his men to intermarry with the native population. In this empire there was an estate, not a racial, distinction between the rulers and the un-Hellenized natives. (Cox)
On the Romans:
In Rome, as in Greece, the slaves did not differ in outward appearance from free men. R.H. Barrow in his study of the Roman slave says that “neither color nor clothing revealed his condition.” Slaves of different nationalities intermarried. There was no color barrier. A woman might be despised as a wife because she came from a despised group or because she practiced barbaric rites but not because her skin was darker. Furthermore, as W.W. Buckland points out, “any citizen might conceivably become a slave; almost any slave might become a citizen.” (Brown, 1949)
In this civilization also we do not find racial antagonism, for the norm of superiority in the Roman system remained a cultural-class attribute. The basic distinction was Roman citizenship, and gradually this was extended to all free-born persons in the municipalities of the empire. Slaves came from every province, and there was no racial distinction among them. (Cox)
There is really no need to go on quoting. The same general picture is true of all the societies, slave and non-slave, from the Roman empire down to the discovery of America – in the barbarian invasions into Europe, which led to enslavement of whites, in the reign of the Moslems, in the era of political domination by the Catholic Church. There were divisions, discriminations and antagonisms of class, cultural, political and religious character, but none along race or color lines, at least none that have left any serious trace in the historical materials now available. As late as the middle of the fifteenth century, when the West African slave trade to Portugal first began, the rationalization for the enslavement of Negroes was not that they were Negro but that they were not Christian. Those who became Christians were freed, intermarried with the Portuguese and were accepted as equals in Portugal. Afterward, of course, when the slave trade became a big business, the readiness of a slave to convert to Christianity no longer sufficed to gain his emancipation.
Why did race prejudice develop in the capitalist era when it did not under the earlier slave systems? Without thinking we have in any way exhausted the subject, we make the following suggestion: In previous times the slaves were usually of the same color as their masters; both whites and Negroes were masters and slaves; in the European countries the Negroes formed a minority of the slave population. The invidious connotations of slavery were attached to all slaves, white and Negro. If under these conditions the notion of Negro “inferiority” occurred to anyone, it would have seemed ridiculous on the face of it; at any rate, it could never have received any social acceptance.
But slavery in the Americas became confined exclusively to Negroes. [2] The Negro was distinguished by his color, and the invidious connotations of slavery could easily be transferred to that; it was inevitable that the theory of Negro “inferiority” and that anti-Negro prejudice should be created, that they should be extended to other non-white people who offered the possibility of exploitation, and that they should be spread around the globe.
Thus anti-Negro prejudice was not born until after capitalism had come into the world. There are differences of opinion as to the approximate birthdate. M.F. Ashley Montagu, discussing the “modern conception of ‘race’,” says:
“Neither in the ancient world nor in the world up to the latter part of the eighteenth century did there exist any notion corresponding to it ... A study of the cultures and literatures of mankind, both ancient and recent, shows us that the conception of natural or biological races of mankind differing from one another mentally as well as physically, is an idea which was not born until the latter part of the eighteenth century,” or around the French Revolution. (Man’s Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race)
Cox says that if he had to put his finger on the year which marked the beginning of race relations, he would select 1493-94 – when the Pope granted to Catholic Spain and Portugal jurisdictional control over, and the right to exploit, all of the (pre-dominantly non-white) heathen people of the world and their resources. He sees “nascent race prejudice” with the beginning of the slave trade: “Although this peculiar kind of exploitation was then in its incipiency, it had already achieved its significant characteristics.” However, he finds that “racial antagonism attained full maturity” only in the second half of the nineteenth century.
Whichever century one chooses, the point is this: Anti-Negro prejudice was originated to justify and preserve a slave-labor system that operated in the interests of capitalism in its pre-industrialist stages, and it was retained in slightly modified form by industrial capitalism after slavery became an obstacle to the further development of capitalism and had to be abolished. Few things in the world are more distinctly stamped with the mark of capitalism.





The implications of this fact are so plain that it is no wonder it has received so little attention in the schools and press of a country dominated by capitalists and their apologists. Anti-Negro prejudice arose out of the needs of capitalism, it is a product of capitalism, it belongs to capitalism, and it will die when capitalism dies.
We who are going to participate in the replacement of capitalism by socialism, and who have good reason to be curious about the first stages of socialism, because we will be living in them, need have no fear about the possibility of any extended lag with respect to race prejudice. Unlike the capitalist system that dominated this country after the Civil War, the socialist society will be free of all exploitative features; it will have no conceivable use for race prejudice, and it will consciously seek to eradicate it along with all the other props of the old system. That is why race prejudice will wither away when capitalism dies – just as surely as the leaf withers when the tree dies, and not much later.
 






A symposium on this subject, celebrating the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation, was held at the Eugene V. Debs Hall in Detroit on Jan. 4, 1963. The speakers, in the order of their presentations, were George Breitman, writer for The Militant; Reginald Wilson, managing editor of Correspondence; and Rev. Albert B. Cleage, Jr., Contributing editor of The Illustrative News. Melissa Singler was chairman. The symposium was sponsored and transcribed by the Friday Night Socialist Forum.



Tonight we are commemorating the 100th anniversary – 100 years and three days – of the Emancipation Proclamation, a convenient date to mark the approximate end of chattel slavery and the approximate beginning of second-class citizenship for the Negro people of the United States. We commemorate that occasion, in line with the subject of tonight’s symposium, not by discussing the events of the past, which certainly deserve to be examined in detail, but by turning our attention to the future of the Negro struggle, whose aim is to abolish second-class citizenship and achieve complete equality.
 
I NOTICE none of us three speakers has brought a crystal ball along with him. That’s good – it means we’ll have to rely on whatever powers of analysis, methods of analysis or theories we possess. The theory that I shall try to apply to tonight’s subject is Marxism, the theory of scientific, revolutionary socialism, which we think is the best instrument of analysis yet devised for understanding the world of today and tomorrow, even if some people mishandle it.
In trying to determine the probable future of the Negro struggle in this country, it is best to begin by considering the future of the world and of the country within which the Negro struggle will unfold. What we see there is a great and irrepressible conflict, headed for a showdown during the remaining years of this century. It is a conflict that will decide whether the world will continue to be dominated by capitalist and imperialist exploiters of labor, or whether the working people of all nations and colors will be able to free themselves from such domination, take their destiny into their own hands, and make the transition to a society where the exploitation of man by man will be abolished and replaced by a system capable of satisfying the needs of mankind, which include equality and peace as well as material abundance.
This irrepressible conflict is the world background and framework for the future of the American Negro struggle, and it is crucial for at least two reasons. One is that it will produce, already has produced, powerful allies of the American Negro all over the world, allies because they have similar objectives and because the enemies of the American Negro are their enemies too. The second reason why the world conflict is relevant to tonight’s subject is that no country is immune or will remain immune from the struggle for or against capitalism, not even the United States, the last stronghold of this dying system. Which means that here at home, as the world crisis of capitalism penetrates and deepens here, as the class struggle between the American capitalist and the American worker sharpens and explodes, here too the Negro will be able to find strong and numerous allies and reinforcements to fight together with him against their common enemy and exploiter. It’s unfortunate that lack of time permits tonight’s speakers only to state points rather than to develop them. But I think I’ve said enough about the world conflict to show that you cannot avoid thinking and talking about its direct and indirect impact on the Negro struggle here.
Turning now to the Negro struggle itself, I think we should start by noting the important developments in the Negro community during the last few years. I want to list some of these and try to explain what they mean, because I think their continuation and deepening are inevitable during the next period.
 
TAKE just the last three years: The sit-ins that began Feb. 1, 1960, and quickly spread all over the South, brought a new force onto the scene, the Southern Negro youth, displaying impatience with the old-style moderate Negro leadership and building their own organizations, like the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, because they are dissatisfied with the old ones. May, 1960 – organization by Negro trade unionists of the Negro American Labor Council, dedicated to fighting discrimination in industry and unions. September, 1960 – the big pro-Castro demonstration in Harlem after the government had launched a massive campaign of propaganda against the Cuban revolution. 1960 – the year that the Muslims were transformed from a sect to an important movement because its spokesmen dared say things about racial oppression that most Negroes wanted voiced. The year that small groups around the country began to form in sympathy with Robert F. Williams’ call for Negroes to defend themselves. The year that the press began to complain openly all over the North about Negroes rallying to the defense of victims of police brutality, sometimes disarming the cops and putting them to flight.
Then 1961 – the small but symptomatic demonstration at the UN against the murder of Lumumba, in February; the freedom rides in the spring; the filling of Southern jails in the summer; the independent mobilization of the Negro community in the Detroit mayoralty election – I could go on with this list all night, but time is limited, so I cut it off, because even a partial list makes the point that something new is happening.
These new events have produced new organizations and have compelled old ones to act and talk more militantly. Along with them have emerged new moods, new feelings, new demands – if not altogether new, at least they are expressed in new ways, more sharply and unequivocally. And if these new feelings and ideas are not already shared by a majority of the Negro people, they surely are, as Loren Miller said in The Nation, rapidly gaining support and respect among the majority.
What are these sentiments, or the most obvious ones? Anger at anyone who tells the Negro he must go slow, take it easy, or wait for the proper time, which is always in the future and never today. Resentment at any kind of paternalism. Suspicion and mistrust of whites, particularly liberals. Rejection of the liberal perspective of very gradual reform, whoever offers it, white liberals or Negro liberals. Contempt for tokenism and those who are satisfied or deceived by it. Mixed feelings about integration and where it will lead, if anywhere. Impatience with progress through gradual change over an indefinite period, and insistence on Freedom Now. A strong desire for racial solidarity and unity. Determination that the Negro should control his own struggles, that these struggles should be led by Negroes, that their tactics and strategy should be determined by Negroes – all resulting in a pronounced preference for all-Negro organizations. Growing support for bloc voting, that is, voting to elect Negroes to represent Negroes, whether in public office or union posts.
 
NOW what do these new events and feelings represent, what do they signify for the future? We have given an answer in The Militant – that this marks the beginning of the radicalization of the Negro people. I still think that estimate is correct, but tonight I would like to approach the question, and if possible to throw light on it, from another angle.
What it signifies is that the Negro struggle is becoming more – independent. More independent – is that all and what’s so remarkable about that? My answer is: It’s the key to the whole future; when the labor movement starts out on the road to independence, as the Negroes are doing, everything will begin to change. What does Negro independence, complete independence, mean? Maybe you can grasp it better by considering what dependence means, the condition that has prevailed to a greater or lesser degree until now.
Dependence means that the Negroes must wait, wait until they get permission, the green signal, the OK, from other forces – from the employers, from the White House, from the Democratic Party, from Solidarity House, from City Hall. Dependence means that Negroes cannot act freely and in accord with their own interests as they see them; that they must wait for the go-sign before they can seriously launch their own demands, candidates and campaigns; that the Negro movement is and can only be the adjunct and appendage of other movements. In short, dependence has been the curse, the fatal weakness, the main source of defeats for the Negro struggle.
 
Dawn of New Day
And now at last, not slowly but rapidly, not tentatively but decisively and irreversibly, this state of dependence is being overcome, to use the Southern movement’s wonderfully expressive word. Dependence is being overcome, mental and psychological shackles are being broken and cast aside, and independence is becoming the goal, the hallmark, the method of decisive change all up and down the line. It is the dawn of a new day, so bright that not everyone has been able to adjust his eyes to it yet, a change every bit as momentous as the Emancipation Proclamation. I cannot think of any more favorable development in this country since the start of the cold war, nor one that holds greater promise for the future.
Conservatives are disturbed by this new tendency, and liberals recoil from it in horror with epithets about “racism” and “Jim Crow in reverse.” But revolutionary socialists support it and welcome it and hail it because it represents a transformation that spells nothing but good for the Negro people, nothing but good for the real interests of the working class, and nothing but good for the fight for socialism.
And here I cannot help using part of my precious time to inform or remind you that it was only the Socialist Workers Party, out of all political tendencies in this country, that foresaw this new development as long as 15 years ago – not in all of its concrete and complex detail, but in its essential characteristics; not only theoretically foresaw and predicted it, but even then, while it was still in an embryonic stage, even then advocated it and defended it as thoroughly legitimate, progressive and desirable. You will find the evidence for this claim, which is also a test of the relevance and validity of Marxism for radical-minded Negroes, in the new Pioneer Publishers publication which is on sale here tonight. It is entitled Documents on the Negro Struggle, covering the years 1933 to 1950, and the last two parts, dealing with the Socialist Workers Party’s 1948 convention resolution, are the ones dealing with the prospects and potential of the kind of independent Negro movement that is being built today.
NOW whenever the point is made that the immediate future will see the continuation and strengthening of the independent tendency that is already in motion, then certain questions and misgivings arise. I don’t mean the objections of conservatives and liberals, which I will disregard at this time. I mean questions that come up in the minds of Negro and white militants, which are pertinent and proper, questions like these:
“Granting that a truly independent Negro movement is necessary, is it enough to insure victory? How far can such a movement go alone?”
In the first place, the independent Negro movement does not have to go it alone. I said earlier it already has allies abroad; even now it has some allies at home. But how far could it go alone, if it had to? I don’t think anybody can answer that question exactly, can say that this movement will be able to go just so far, and no farther. This is one of those questions that can be answered only in action, in practice, through the testing of the relation of forces. But it can be said with certainty that an independent Negro movement can go much farther, can achieve much more, can force much greater concessions from the rulers of this country than dependent and semi-dependent movements have won up to now. Our rulers know this just as well as we do; that’s why they’ve employed so much brainwash, bribery and brutality to keep the movement in a dependent status.
Another part of the question was: Can an independent Negro movement, by itself, achieve its goal of complete and unconditional equality? Our answer must be that this is very unlikely. Saying this does not contradict what we have said about the many positive features and the presently underrated potential of an independent movement. It is a conclusion imposed on us by a fact, a cold hard numerical fact, that the Negroes are a small numerical minority of the population – between one-ninth and one-tenth. This creates strategic and tactical problems quite different from those existing in countries like South Africa, where dark-skinned people are an overwhelming majority and where racial oppression can be uprooted through majority rule. In our country Negroes can win equality only if the white population is divided, only if a substantial part of the white population is won to the side of the Negro people as an ally.
 
THE indicated major ally of the Negro people is the working class, the labor movement. For many reasons: Most Negroes are workers themselves. Negroes and white workers have common needs – decent jobs, housing, schooling, peace, etc. In addition, the white workers, even if most of them don’t understand it yet, are themselves injured by the Jim Crow system, and are weakened in the pursuit of their own main objectives by racial divisions and antagonisms. Nobody has to preach to the Negroes about the need and advantages of a labor-Negro alliance. They have been in favor of it for a long time; in fact, no section of the population has been more pro-labor during the last quarter-century than the Negro people.
If a labor-Negro alliance does not exist, or if it exists only in a partial and distorted way, it is not their fault, but the fault of the labor bureaucracy.
The real point is that there is no contradiction whatever, either in logic or in practice, between organizing or reorganizing the Negro movement along independent lines and achieving alliances with other sections of the population, starting with the working class. In fact, many militant Negroes view doing the first job as an indispensable condition for successfully doing the second. They believe – correctly, in my opinion – that first they must unite and shape and orient their own movement, and that only then will they be able to bring about an alliance that will have results – that is, an alliance of equals, where they can be reasonably sure their demands and needs cannot be subordinated by their allies. (When I say they must create their own movement first, I do not mean that they cannot also simultaneously begin the forging of alliances, but that if any temporary conflicts should arise between these two tasks, then priority should be given to the needs of creating the independent Negro movement.)
 
No Easy Road
So what revolutionary socialists foresee is this: The Negro people, drawn together by their common experiences as an oppressed minority, will build an increasingly independent movement, fighting militantly for equality under their own banner, with their own program and behind their own leaders. They will not build this movement easily, smoothly, without setbacks and defeats, without mistakes – but at least they will be the Negroes’ own mistakes, not those foisted on them by their enemies and false friends, and so they will be able to learn from such mistakes and correct them.
One effect of their independent struggles will be to shake up and divide the white population, which will simultaneously be shaken and divided by the many social and political conflicts flowing out of the international crisis and the domestic class struggles that I referred to in the beginning. Thus new alliances will emerge, particularly because the labor movement will not always remain as it is today, dominated and controlled by a narrow-minded and conservative bureaucracy; new op-positional and left-wing formations inside the unions will challenge the Meanys and Reuthers too.
A new alliance will be forged between the independent Negro movement and the leftward moving sections of the labor movement. We cannot supply any exact dates, or predict all the complicated forms this development will take, or foresee all the twists, turns, re-formations and realignments this will entail. But this alliance, we predict, will assume an advanced political character, breaking with the Democratic Party and building a new party whose goal will be to depose the present ruling class, and it will be the instrument through which the Negro people will win their second emancipation and the white workers their deliverance from capitalism. We place major stress on such a labor-Negro alliance because until it is created the next American revolution cannot take place, and because as soon as it is created basic social change will become a serious point at the very top of the American agenda. All this we socialists not only predict, but advocate and fight for.
 
I THINK I have time within my 30-minute limit to squeeze in just one more point, and it is this: It’s common knowledge here that revolutionary socialists say the capitalist ruling class will never grant genuine equality to the Negro people. I haven’t the time to repeat our reasons for this belief, which would require us to discuss the basic cause of racial oppression, and the ways in which racial oppression is inextricably intertwined with the roots of the profit system in the United States; perhaps these things will come up in the discussion period. Anyhow, that’s what we think, and whether you agree or disagree with us, you will have to admit that the position you take on this question necessarily plays a big part in any forecasts you make about the future of the Negro struggle.
We not only think that American capitalism won’t grant equality to the Negroes, but we also think that the Negro people, by fighting for equality under this system, will inevitably, through their own expedience and not out of some socialist pamphlet, come to the most far-reaching revolutionary conclusions – including the conclusion that capitalism must go if racism is to be eliminated.
The correctness or incorrectness of our analysis of American capitalism will not be settled by debate tonight. It will be proved or disproved through action, action in the streets and in the ballot booths, through struggle, through the struggle of the Negroes and their allies for equality – equality within the capitalist system if it can be won there, or equality outside this system if it can’t be won here. We are quite willing to put our analysis to that test, and to join the Negro people in fighting for as much equality as can be achieved under this system. We are confident that the outcome of such a test will be enlightening and beneficial for both the Negro and socialist movements.

(A speaker who identified himself as a Black Nationalist, opposing integration and favoring separation, asked what the small socialist movement had to offer black people, and why Debs Hall has pictures on the wall only of white men – Marx, Trotsky, Debs.)
The question was about the relation between the independent Negro movement and the revolutionary socialist movement. First, however, I’d like to comment on Rev. Cleage’s remark that during the war all the radical groups he heard in San Francisco advised the Negroes to subordinate their struggle to the war effort. I want to say that Rev. Cleage evidently didn’t hear what the Socialist Workers Party had to say during World War II. Because the Socialist Workers Party was that section of the radical movement which insisted that the Negro struggle should not be subordinated, and which fought against the Jim Crow system and made the fight against it a paramount issue from the beginning to the end of the war.
The question was about the relations between the two movements and what the socialist movement has to offer to the Negro people. Now, certainly in terms of numbers, which is the way the question was posed, the revolutionary socialist movement is much smaller today than the Negro movement. But what is involved is more than numbers, what’s involved is a question of ideas, of program, of a program that is concerned with the relation of forces between Negroes and other sections of the population. Socialists are opposed to the Jim Crow system for the same reasons that Negro people are opposed to it and for other reasons, not only because it oppresses Negroes but also because it hurts white workers. We don’t consider the development of an independent, militant, mass Negro organization as being in contradiction with that movement also working with whatever allies are available ...
 
(Interruption by questioner, who asked why black people should ally themselves with white workers when the latter are prejudiced.)
There is no intention whatever on our part to deny that a majority of the white people in this country are prejudiced. If the situation as it is now were to continue forever, then our program would have no application. But we believe that things change, and that the thinking of the white workers will change too. Not today, not tomorrow completely, but we think they will respond to certain needs of their own, to certain pressures, international and national pressures, including those that result from the action of an independent Negro movement. That is one of the things we are trying to do – to help educate white workers to understand that their real interests are similar to those of the Negro people.
Now there are two main reasons why white workers are prejudiced. One is that they do have certain advantages from the Jim Crow system; it gives them certain privileges. But these privileges and advantages are nowhere near as great as they think they are, and in addition the Jim Crow system affects them adversely too. It distracts them from the struggle for their real objectives, aims and interests; the divisions between white and Negro workers hurt them both as members of the working class. The other reason why white workers are prejudiced is that they too have been brainwashed for a long time. They too have been subjected to the racist propaganda of the ruling class. We don’t think that this propaganda is always going to be effective. We think that the workers will be able to shake off its effects in the course of fighting for their own needs. The Negro people have been brainwashed for centuries, no group has been brainwashed for a longer time. Yet we see now that they have been able to throw off the effects of this brainwashing, declare their independence and start off on a new road. If Negroes can do it, if Negroes can overcome the pernicious effects of brainwashing, then we say it’s also possible for white workers to do it.
Therefore, when we talk about the future, we are not talking about the working class as it is today, with the kind of leaders it has today; we expect that the working class will change, as a result of its own experience and the pressure of its own needs. And the kind of alliance we predict for the future, and advocate and fight for, is not an alliance between prejudiced white workers and Negroes, but of Negroes with those white workers who have shaken off the ideas of the ruling class, including the racist prejudices that the ruling class persistently fosters and inculcates, and who recognize the necessity of working together with the Negro people for their common aims.
The question was also asked about the hall here, why do we put up pictures of white people? We put up pictures of these working class leaders because of the program they represent, not because of their race, and we will put up the pictures of other leaders who represent the program which we are trying to convince the American people will lead them to liberation, equality and peace.

linism Will Be Ended, 29 June, 1953     George Breitman How Stalinism Will Be Ended (29 June 1953)  From The Militant,  Vol. 17 No. 26, June 29, 1953.  In his funeral speech over Stalin, Premier Malenkov pledged that he would continue Stalin’s policies. But Isaac Deutscher (in his new book, Russia: What Next?) does not believe this is likely, except with regard to economic-social policy (planning, nationalization, etc.). As evidence that the new regime has struck out on a non-Stalinist path, Deutscher points to step it took in its first weeks – re-organization of the party and government machinery, the amnesty, the promise to reform the penal cone, reversal of the doctors’ frame-up, price cuts, criticism of one-man autocracy, appeals for collective leadership, etc. Now these acts do represent departures from some of the rigid bureaucratic practices associated with Stalin, and they are so viewed by the Soviet people. But do they mean that the Malenkov regime has instituted a decisive break with Stalinism? Deutscher seems to think so although he states this view cautiously. He recognizes that the government was more or less forced, after Stalin’s death – for reasons explained in our article last week – to conciliate the Soviet people with measures to satisfy some of their aspirations and to keep them hoping for more concessions. He even writes: “As one analyzes Malenkov’s first moves, one can almost hear him pleading in the inner circle of the Kremlin: Better to abolish the worst features of Stalinism from above than to wait until they are abolished from below.” In other words, one of the basic motivations for the new measures is a fear that the Soviet people may move to overthrow the dictatorship, and a desire to head it off. But when these measures are viewed in this light, doesn’t it become clear that they are designed not to weaken the dictatorship but to strengthen it? A dictatorship cleansed of some of its more repressive and irrational features might secure a broader base of support or tolerance than it did under Stalin, especially during the first stages, when the people are hopeful of change and the regime has a desperate need to consolidate its position. But it would remain a dictatorship just the same, wouldn’t it? Deutscher, however, tends to stress only one side of the reasons for the new measures. That is because it is convenient for his theory, which amounts roughly to something like this:  Sees tug of war  A tug of war has been going on inside the bureaucracy for some years. One section wants to “liberalize” and “rationalize” Stalinism; at home it wants to offer some concessions to the people to keep them from getting out of hand; abroad, it wants to offer some limited concessions to the imperialists in order to avert war, which it thinks can be postponed for a relatively long time. Their opponents, Deutscher continues, are the die-hard Stalinists; who draw their strength from the political police (bitterly against any changes in the status quo at home) and from the army (whose leaders think war is inevitable and refuse to yield any concessions that might be of strategic value to the imperialists in the coming war). He views the doctor’s frame-up as a plot by the police, perhaps in collusion with the army, to weaken the reform forces. Deutscher thinks the “liberalizers,” in the form of the Malenkov regime, now have the upper hand. He admits that Malenkov, because of his Stalinist training, may not want to go too far; that he does not want to destroy the police, but only to tame and control them; that he may reverse his path, or be overthrown by the die-hards, if the masses get out of hand or if there is a war; etc. But on the whole he suggests that the Malenkov regime represents the beginning of the reform of the Soviet bureaucracy.  Three variants In his view, there are three variants: 1. A “relapse into Stalinism,” with the police back in the saddle. If this happens, he doesn’t think it would last long because the same factors that have been working to undermine  Stalinism in recent years would operate to end its revival. Even if the police should unite with the generals to take over power, he believes this would mean a military dictatorship rather than the traditional form of Stalinism. 2. Military dictatorship. Deutscher thinks this is possible because of the generals’ demand for a tough policy in foreign affairs. He does not consider it probable unless the Malenkov regime proves unable to keep the people in line, and does not believe it would mean the restoration of capitalism. 3. “Democratic regeneration.” He sees this, on balance, as the most likely variant. He assumes that Malenkov wants to go at least part of the way in this direction, and that the masses would support his moves and give his regime the necessary stability within which it could initiate a return to proletarian democracy  How will it end? Some of Deutscher’s arguments in support of this view are based on speculation pure and simple, which we can neither accept nor reject at this time. But we must reject his major conclusion, which flows from fatal defects in his analysis of Stalinism. We agree that even while Stalin was alive the base of Stalinism was being undermined by Soviet economic and cultural progress and the spread of revolution throughout the world. We agree that the new regime, whatever its wishes, cannot rule in the same way that Stalin did. We agree that the end of Stalinism has begun (but not, as Deutscher implies in some places, that Stalinism is now a thing of the past). We also agree that the only real alternative to Stalinism in the Soviet Union is workers’ democracy. But we emphatically disagree with the contention that the end of Stalinism is going to come about as a result of a self-reform of the Soviet bureaucracy.  Nature of bureaucracy What Deutscher doesn’t understand and slurs over is the nature of the Soviet bureaucracy as a special social stratum, a caste, whose interests clash with those of the workers and peasants. The bureaucracy did not usurp its privileges merely to enhance its prestige: it has material interests at stake which it will fight to the death to preserve against the workers and peasants who want a reduction of inequality in the sphere of consumption. Consequently a harmonious reconciliation between the bureaucracy and the masses is not the easy possibility, even probability, that Deutscher airily assumes it to be. The bureaucrats are not going to relinquish their caste privileges until they have been defeated decisively by the working class. This is not to deny that the downfall of the Soviet bureaucracy may be preceded by a split in its ranks, with one section perhaps going over to the people. But that is not the same thing as expecting a reform of the bureaucracy to lead to “an orderly winding up of Stalinism and a gradual democratic evolution.” Another thing Deutscher doesn’t understand or accept is the Marxist analysis of the present state form in the Soviet Union as a Bonapartist dictatorship. Although Deutscher is acquainted with this analysis, first worked out by Trotsky, he acts as if he isn’t, and he doesn’t counterpose any other analysis. But he shows that he rejects it by defining Bonapartism almost exclusively as a purely military dictatorship, and talks about it only as a future danger. This makes it easier for him to spin his theory about the approaching metamorphosis of the dictatorship into its opposite. But the Malenkov regime’s concessions to the people don’t change its character as a Bonapartist dictatorship; they only indicate that the dictatorship has been weakened. A weakened Bonapartist dictatorship, even when it waves the banner of “liberalization,” is still a Bonapartist dictatorship. And Bonapartist dictatorships generally have to be overthrown.  What Trotsky sought Deutscher’s illusions and runaway speculations even lead him to write: “In the 1930’s Trotsky advocated a ‘limited political revolution’ against Stalinism. He saw it not as a full-fledged social upheaval but as an ‘administrative operation’ directed against the chiefs of the political police and a small clique terrorizing the nation. As so often, Trotsky was tragically ahead of his time and prophetic in his vision of the future, although he could not imagine that Stalin’s closest associates would act in accordance with his scheme. What Malenkov’s government is carrying out now is precisely the ‘limited revolution’ envisaged by Trotsky.” This is a flagrant distortion of Trotsky’s views on the regeneration of the Soviet Union. We don’t know which article of Trotsky Deutscher is citing, or when it was written. The Stalin regime had not yet reached its fully totalitarian form in the early 30’s, when Trotsky thought it was still possible to reform the Comintern; it was not until the mid-30’s that Trotsky rounded out his analysis of Soviet Bonapartism and the measures required to get rid of it.A political revolution But Deutscher knows that toward the end of Trotsky’s life, and especially after the Moscow Trial purges, he never tired of advocating an “unlimited” political revolution against Stalinism. The revolution Trotsky advocated was of course not directed against the social system in the Soviet Union, which he defended to the end. What he worked for was a political revolution – against social inequality and political repression, for the regeneration of Soviet democracy and the legalization of Soviet parties. In fact Trotsky went so far, in the 1938 Transitional Program, as to call on the workers “to drive the bureaucracy and the new aristocracy out of the Soviets” in the same sense that capitalist representatives were excluded from the original Soviets. Anybody who equates such a revolution, which the bureaucracy would fight tooth and nail, with the “liberalization” measures taken by Malenkov and Co., is losing touch with reality or adapting himself to Soviet Bonapartism. In neither case can he render any service to the fight for Soviet democracy.  Socialist regeneration The reality is this: The Soviet dictatorship is in the throes of a deep crisis. As a result, the bureaucracy has offered certain concessions to the workers to keep them from moving on their own. Instead of satisfying the workers for long, these concessions will encourage them to press for new demands (the East German political strike was a preview of what is going to happen in the Soviet bloc as a whole). The crisis will produce further divisions and conflicts among the bureaucracy which the workers will be able to use for their awn purposes. War may delay the process, but cannot abolish it. The Soviet Bonapartist dictatorship is doomed, as Trotsky predicted it would be doomed, by the spread of world  revolution, and it will be replaced by the democratic power of the Soviet working class. The change will take place through a political revolution against the Kremlin regime, not through its reform. There is no other way to the socialist regeneration of the Soviet Union.

Breitman: Why the Soviet Bureaucracy Is in Crisis   George Breitman Why the Soviet Bureaucracy Is in Crisis (22 June 1953)  From The Militant,  Vol. 17 No. 25, June 22, 1953.  What has been happening in the Soviet Union since Stalin died? Why? What lies ahead? Isaac Deutscher’s new book (Russia: What Next? Oxford University Press, 1953, 230 pp., $3) provides a convenient framework for examining the answers to these vital questions. We have many profound differences with Deutscher, some of which were expressed in this paper’s review of his Stalin biography in 1949. But it must be recognized that he stands out conspicuously among the writers who are able to get books about the Soviet Union printed by capitalist publishers. For one thing, Deutscher, who was expelled from the Polish Communist Party as an oppositionist in 1932, generally knows what he is writing about. He has a good grasp of Soviet history, fortified by a careful study of Leon Trotsky’s writings. His conclusions and interpretations are sometimes in conflict with the facts he presents, but he does not consciously hide or distort the facts. That alone makes him superior to most of the mob of present-day commentators on the Soviet Union. Moreover, he does not pander to the prejudices of capitalist opinion, often expressing views regarded as “subversive” in Washington, and he deals with serious questions, including some of Marxist theory. These positive qualities are displayed in his latest book, even though it was written hastily in the first few weeks after Stalin’s death.  Changes caused crisis Deutscher believes that Stalinism has ended or is in the process of being liquidated in the Soviet Union. Not merely because of Stalin’s death, but because of the severe crisis of Stalinism which had been latent for some time and was only brought into the open by his death. This will not come as a new idea to readers of The Militant and the magazine Fourth International, which have regularly called attention to the deep-going crisis of Stalinism and the causes for it. But they will be interested in Deutscher’s analysis of this crisis. It arose, he shows, because of changes in economic, social and political conditions inside and outside the Soviet Union. The conditions that made it possible for Stalin to come to power have altered decisively; that is why his successors cannot play the same role he did. Stalin tried to his last breath to maintain the Stalinist system, but it was beginning to break up under and around him. Ironically, as Deutscher notes, Stalin himself contributed to the changes that spelled the doom of Stalinism. Stalin came to power because of two important factors: (1) the economic and cultural backwardness of the Soviet Union, aggravated by ruinous years of war and civil war; (2) the isolation of the first workers state as a result of the delays and defeats of the revolution in Europe, which the Bolshevik leaders had expected to link up with and strengthen the revolution in Russia. Trotsky explained many times how and why these conditions led to the degeneration of the Bolshevik Party and its eventual destruction by the privileged bureaucratic caste which opposed the revolutionary-internationalist, proletarian-democratic policies of Lenin. But the Stalinist bureaucracy was beset by many contradictions. Russia’s poverty enabled Stalinism to come to power, but to remain in power and to preserve its privileges, which were threatened on one side by imperialism and on the other by the possibilities of revolt by the Soviet masses, it needed a strong economy. This meant industrialization. Although a section of the bureaucracy tended toward the restoration of capitalism in the 20’s, Stalin knew that the Soviet people would never tolerate it, and after some wavering he set out to industrialize the country through the extension of nationalization and planning, the economic foundations of the workers state created under Lenin. Deutscher realizes that Stalin’s methods were brutal and costly, and vitiated part of the results (he wrongly attributes the over all results to Stalin’s “historical function”). It evidently does not occur to him that Stalin’s methods delayed rather than promoted the process as a whole. Deutscher does not appreciate the decisive part played by the firm social foundations of the Russian revolution, but he is correct in noting that under Stalin’s regime great transformations took place. From an industrially backward country the Soviet Union became the second industrial power in the world. Soviet Chicagos, Pittsburghs and Detroits sprouted into all corners of a vast land. Tens of millions of peasants were turned into industrial workers. Small farms were broken up, and more tens of millions became collective farmers, torn out of conservative self-sufficiency and thrust into awareness of their dependence on government policy. A large part of the population was urbanized, practically all of it was made literate. New habits were formed, new patterns of culture evolved. The superiority of planned economy was proved in practice (and Deutscher correctly emphasizes that planning rather than Stalin’s forced-labor system was the dominant factor in industrial progress). What effects did all this have on the social and political consciousness of the Soviet people? Obviously, big ones. The soil out of which Stalinism grew was being destroyed. “Technology, planning, urbanization, and industrial expansion are the deadliest enemies” of Stalinism. A nation of 160 to 200 million was driven, in 25 years time, “to jump the chasm which separated the epoch of the wooden plow from that of the atomic pile. The jump is not yet completed ... All we know is that the process is in a very advanced stage. Russia may still be mired up to her ankles or to her knees in the epoch of primitive magic; but she is not plunged in it up to her neck and ears, as she was a quarter of a century ago.”  “Self-containment” During the same time that the backwardness of Russia, in which Stalinism had its roots, was being overcome, drastic changes on the international scene were further altering the relations between the Stalinist bureaucracy and the Soviet masses. Stalin began his regime by announcing the doctrine of “socialism in one country.” Among other things this signaled the abandonment of Lenin’s internationalism and in the course of time the adoption of an actively counter-revolutionary policy in which Stalin sought to ward off imperialist attack by striving to prevent revolution abroad. Using current formulations, Deutscher calls Stalin’s foreign policy “self-containment” as opposed to Lenin’s policy of stimulating “liberation” of other countries from capitalism. Stalin tried to maintain the international status quo. The world Stalinist movement served as border guards to promote the Kremlin’s foreign policy and diplomatic maneuvers, regardless of their disastrous s pus effects on the interests of the workers in the capitalist countries.  The great saboteur Deutscher knows and reviews all this. He is definitely not a Stalinist and would think it unjust to be called an apologist for Stalinism, but objectively that is what he shows himself to be when he discusses this phase of history. “Was Stalin then the great saboteur and betrayer of world revolution, as Trotsky saw him?” he asks. And his answer is: “Yes and no. He certainly did his best to destroy the potentialities for revolution abroad – in the name of the sacred egoism of the Russian revolution. But how real and important were those potentialities between the two world wars? Trotsky saw that period as one sequence of great but missed revolutionary opportunities. The historian of the period cannot be so sure about its latent possibilities. He can gauge only its actuality, not its potentiality. Stalin worked on the assumption that there was no chance of a communist victory in the West or in the East. If that was so, then he was sacrificing to the selfishness of Bolshevik Russia the shadow, not the substance, of world revolution. He believed that by building up the Soviet `citadel of socialism’ he was making the only contribution toward world revolution that could be made at the time. This conviction allowed him to treat the labor movements of the world with boundless cynicism and contempt.” But a historian who declines to examine and pass judgment on the potentialities is not gauging the full actuality. Were the revolutionary possibilities real and important in Germany in 1923 and 1932, in China in the 1920’s, in Spain in 1936, etc.? Trotsky not only saw but showed the possibilities. Stalin saw them too, in his own way, and he sabotaged them. Wasn’t Stalin’s intervention – actively against these revolutions – a major part of the actuality? Wasn’t his counter-revolutionary intervention more real than Deutscher’s hypotheses about what Stalin was thinking? Elsewhere Deutscher has praised Stalin for leading the war against Hitler to victory, but isn’t it just as important that Stalin’s policies helped Hitler to come to power and later to launch the war? However, this basic flaw in Deutscher’s historical method does not prevent him from making a generally correct evaluation of the reasons why “in the last decade of his life Stalin struggled desperately and unavailingly to save his policy of self - containment, or what remained of it, from the tempest of the time.” Stalin wanted and expected to keep Eastern Europe capitalist after the war. His policy of reparations and pillage in those countries during the first postwar years was certainly inconsistent with their later incorporation into the Soviet social system. But the imperialists offered him no choice, and after the Truman Doctrine of 1947 he was driven to take over Eastern Europe definitively to prevent it from being used as a base for war against the Soviet Union. Elsewhere in the world, “Stalin gravely underrated the revolutionary ferment which was to engulf Europe and Asia toward the end of the war and after.”. He thought he could control it through the Communist Parties, and he did in some countries. But in others, his “pawns” began to move on their own – in Yugoslavia, in China – and he was in no position to stop them. He tried to restrain Mao Tse-tung and Tito, but they were under pressure from the masses in their own countries as well as the Kremlin, and they went ahead to lead revolutions against regimes Stalin had directed them to collaborate with. “He stared with incredulity and fear at the rising tides of revolution which threatened to wash away the rock of ‘socialism in one country’ on which he had built his temple. This so-called prophet of Marxism and Leninism appears at this moment as the most conservative statesman in the world ... Stalinist self-containment was subsequently wrecked, partly by forces beyond Stalin’s control and partly by Stalin himself.” These revolutions changed the international relationship of forces. The Soviet Union’s isolation, a cause of Stalinism and a pretext for its continuation, was ended. The threat of imperialist attack, while still real, appeared in a different light when the Soviet bloc encompassed one-third of the world’s population.  Discontent grew All this stored new dynamite under the Kremlin, and new discontent spread among the Soviet masses, who could see that the reasons which led them to tolerate the rigors of the Stalinist dictatorship before the war no longer-obtained after the war. This discontent could not be expressed in clear political terms while Stalin was alive, but Deutscher shows that it was expressed indirectly during the last two or three years in the debates over the alleged imminent “transition from socialism to communism” and the theory of the withering away of the state. Stalin didn’t intend these debates for that purpose, but they were utilized widely to express the desire of the masses and a part of the bureaucracy for an end or relaxation of the dictatorship, for an improvement of living standards, protection against the political police, etc. Deutscher sees these disguised forms in which the masses raised their demands as signs that an explosion was brewing before Stalin died. Deutscher’s explanation of the background of the present situation are the best parts of his book. Next week we will discuss other parts, especially his reasons for thinking that the Soviet Union is headed toward “an orderly winding up of Stalinism anti a gradual democratic evolution” under the leadership of the Soviet bureaucracy.

  After recording the major crimes of Stalinism, Isaac Deutscher’s Stalin: A Political Biography comes to the conclusion that it is fundamentally revolutionary and progressive, despite its ruinous policies. despite the tyrannical and repressive methods it uses against the workers at home and abroad. Last week we discussed the fallaciousness of Deutscher’s evaluation of the role of Stalinism inside the Soviet Union: here we continue with an examination of ’his interpretation of the events in Eastern Europe since 1945. To meet the economic crisis in the Soviet Union after the war, Deutscher says, Stalin resorted to two methods. One was the “nationalist” method, which consisted in plundering the defeated countries, dismantling and transferring factories, instituting slave labor on a mass scale, etc. The other he calls the “revolutionary” method, which consisted “in the broadening of the economic base on which planned economy was to operate, in an economic link-up between Russia and the countries within her orbit.” To achieve this, the Stalinists had to take power in those countries, although at the same time they helped to preserve the capitalist system intact in the more advanced countries of Western Europe.)  Stalin’s new concept In employing the second method, Deutscher continues, Stalin tacitly admitted that “socialism in one country” was impossible and vindicated Trotsky’s condemnation of it. But Deutscher does not completely endorse the vulgar distortion, now widely current, that Stalinist expansion proves Stalin has returned to Leninism. For although Stalin was forced in effect to repudiate his basic theory, he did not go “back to his starting point, to the conception of world revolution he had once shared with Lenin and Trotsky [before 1924]. He now replaced his socialism in one country by something that might be termed ‘socialism in one zone’.“ (Like its predecessor, this new Stalinist concept accepts and will even strengthen the capitalist order in the rest of the world in return for being allowed to strengthen its own position.) From this Deutscher passes to a discussion of the Stalinist “revolutions.” “The old Bolshevism ... believed that the Socialist order would result from the original experience and struggle of the working classes abroad, that it would be the most authentic act of their social and political self-determination. The old Bolshevism, in other words, believed in revolution from below, such as the upheaval of 1917 had been. The revolution which Stalin now carried into eastern and central Europe was primarily a revolution from above,” which was “decreed, inspired and managed” by Stalin’s political and military agencies, although the workers also participated to one degree or another. “What took place within the Russian orbit was, therefore, semi-conquest and semi-revolution ... it is the blending of conquest and revolution that makes the essence of ‘socialism in one zone.’”  Anti-socialist acts Now, the statification of property in Eastern Europe has certain progressive features, even though it is incomplete and is achieved by military-bureaucratic means. But simultaneously with these measures, the bureaucracy moved against the masses, preventing them from taking power into their own hands and carrying through a genuine proletarian revolution. The bureaucracy, eventually drove out the old ruling classes, with whom it saw no reason to keep on sharing the privileges of power. But from the very beginning it struck most brutally at any independent action by the masses, whom it feared more than the old ruling classes and whom it was determined to keep in a subordinate position. The attitude of revolutionary socialists to such measures was clearly expressed by Trotsky at the very beginning of the war, when Stalin’s troops had invaded eastern Poland: “The primary political criterion for us is not the transformation of property relations in this or another area, however important these may be in themselves, but rather the change in the consciousness and organization of the world proletariat, the raising of their capacity for defending former conquests and accomplishing new ones. From this one, and the only decisive standpoint, the politics of Moscow, taken as a whole, completely retains its reactionary character and remains the chief obstacle on the road to the world revolution.”  Decisive standpoint The decisive standpoint, Trotsky termed it, because the can be no socialist transformation of society unless the masses understand the need for it and carry it through themselves. The emancipation of the workers is the task of the workers themselves; no one else can do it for them–that is the unique thing about the socialist revolution. It is a task they can carry through only when they are organized in a revolutionary party and in Soviets or their equivalent, democratically expressing their will–and all such organizations are prohibited and suppressed by the Stalinist policemen-bureaucrats. The expression “revolution from above” is self-contradictory. We can conceive and have already witnessed, as the result of the continuing degeneration of the first workers state, the transformation of property relations by bureaucratic measures. But since these measures are directed as much against the revolutionary classes as against the old ruling classes, a more exact name would be “counter-revolution from above.” Even when they entail new property relations, changes that do not put power in the hands of the working class, changes in which the masses are relegated to a subsidiary if not a wholly passive role, are a grotesque abortion rather than a living expression of socialist transformation.  Historic parallel? Stalinism strangles the socialist revolution even when it is compelled to transform property relations; its over-all character, therefore, is counter-revolutionary. That is why it must be fought and smashed, and that is why Deutscher is wrong when he attempts to establish historic parallels between Cromwell and Robespierre and the dictator in the Kremlin. Stalin is like them, he says, in being despotic and in being “revolutionary, not in the sense that he has remained true to all the original ideas of the revolution, but because he has put into practice a fundamentally new principle of social organization, which, no matter what happens to him personally or even to the regime associated with his name is certain to survive, to fertilize human experience, and to turn it in new directions.”	 We have already shown that the credit for the “new principle of social organization” belongs to the 1917 revolution and not to Stalinism; that what Stalin did was not to put it into practice but to alter and distort it, to weaken and undermine it, to pervert it and exploit. it. But this is only the beginning of Deutscher’s misinterpretation ... Cromwell and Robespierre were petty bourgeois leaders of the bourgeois revolution in their respective countries. They represented the historically progressive tendencies of the capitalist system, which was then coming to power. They sought to defend the interests of the new social order, by violent means and dictatorship, on the one hand against the former ruling class, the aristocrats, and on the other hand against the plebeian elements who had been the best fighters for the bourgeois revolution and who attempted to go beyond the bounds of capitalist society.  The difference Stalin, like Cromwell and Robespierre, crushed the revolutionary mass movement on the left; in that sense, a certain limited analogy can be constructed. But when we examine the social content of their respective acts against the masses we can see that it refutes rather than confirms Deutscher’s attempt at a historic parallel. For Cromwell and Robespierre could crush the plebeians who were seeking to push the revolution beyond the bounds of capitalist inequality, without decisively impairing the new revolutionary (capitalist) structure. But the social revolution of the 20th century differs from the bourgeois revolutions in this fundamental respect: It is impossible without the leadership, initiative and creative direction of the working class. When Stalin suppresses these, he undermines the degenerated workers state in the Soviet Union and prepares the way for the restoration of capitalism; much more important, he prevents the world socialist revolution. Stalin cannot be compared with Cromwell and Robespierre, therefore, because on the whole they helped to build a new and progressive society (although they weakened it by suppressing the masses) while Stalinism on the whole blocks, impedes and opposes the construction of a new and progressive society; because they served the interests of the revolutionary capitalist class while he subverts the interests of the revolutionary working class for the benefit of a parasitic bureaucratic caste. It is necessary to stress the counter-revolutionary nature of Stalinism over and over again because many people, seeking a way out of the present world crisis and seeing no other alternative as yet, are impelled to turn in the direction of Stalinism. Books like Deutscher’s must be combatted relentlessly because they help to sustain the illusion that Stalinism, despite its “faults,” is a “lesser evil” to capitalism–the main illusion diverting people from the revolutionary socialist movement which alone offers a program for social progress.   
  Stalin: A Political Biographyby Isaac Deutscher Oxford University Press, 1949, 600 pp., $5. The publishers of this biography say, “It is not pro-Stalin; it is not pro-Communist. It is, rather, that rare creation – an objective book ...” Whether or not the book is genuinely objective, its complex character was certainly confirmed by the conflicting reviews it received from the different political schools. The N. Y. Times reviewer, generally reflecting the sentiments of the capitalist press, thinks it will serve as “the classic biography and reference book” on Stalin until such time as the historians get access to the archives in the Soviet Union. But he refuses to offer a “final judgment” on this volume until he has had a chance to study Deutscher’s next two books, dealing with Lenin and Trotsky, presumably so that he can get a clearer idea of Deutscher’s attitude to. Lenin and Leninism. The Social Democratic New Leader issued a pre-publication memorandum warning all reviewers that it is “the most adroit apology for Soviet domestic and foreign policy to be published in many years.” Its own review disparages Deutscher for “his evident ideological bias. in favor of the broad aims of the Lenin-Trotsky-Stalin experiment.” For the Stalinist Daily Worker it is “a grotesque amalgam of concepts and phrases borrowed from Marxism, Trotskyism and the capitalists ... bristling with garbled quotations ... this spurious facade of balanced historiography ... veils a savage bias and an unscrupulous use of every slander and lie which, has ever been utilized against Stalin and the Soviet Union ... a pyramid of lies ... the same old smelly package.” The Shachtmanite Labor Action ’finds it an “impressive achievement ... written from a generally Marxist point of view,” but marred by “a very poor final chapter” in which “Deutscher succumbs to a variety of  ‘Cannonism’ – actually, that is, to a critical acceptance of the Stalinist myth.” Deutscher himself says: “This book is intended as the first installment of a biographical trilogy to be continued and completed with a Life of Lenin and a study of Trotsky in Exile. The main study of pre-1917 Bolshevism and the history of such ideas as the dictatorship of the proletariat, the Soviets, the ’proletarian vanguard,’ and so on, must have their place in the biography of Lenin. In the present volume the growth and evolution of these ideas have been sketched only in so far as it was necessary for an understanding of the chief character.” Deutscher is a Polish journalist who broke with Stalinism in 1932 because he favored a united front with the Social Democrats against the Nazis; it is said that for a while he was sympathetic to Trotskyism. At the beginning of the war, however, he came to England, and served as a Russian expert on the editorial staff of The Economist and for the BBC. He is well acquainted with the factual and documentary material available on his subject and handles them scrupulously on the whole, although in general his method is to question all charges or testimony adverse to Stalin that cannot be verified beyond question, and to give him, the benefit of the doubt in most such cases. It is this method, plus the curiously detached manner in which it is written, that has earned the book its reputation for objectivity in some quarters. He also has the irritating habit, after detailing one of Stalin’s crimes against the revolution, of engaging in entirely uncalled for speculation about possible justifications for his acts which Stalin may have had in his mind. Thus, after reporting the Moscow Trials and showing them to be monstrous frameups, he adds: “It is not necessary to assume that he [Stalin] acted from sheer cruelty or lust for power. He may be given the dubious credit of the sincere conviction that what he did served the interests of the revolution and that he alone interpreted those interests aright.” There is much in this book that no Marxist can accept. One of the worst is Deutscher’s evaluation of the period of industrialization and collectivization beginning with the first Five-Year Plan in 1929 as Soviet Russia’s “second revolution, which was directed solely and exclusively by Stalin” and “was even more sweeping and, radical than the first” in its scope and immediate effect on the masses. But, as Trotsky pointed out ten years ago, the source of economic progress in the USSR was the revolution of 1917, which led to the nationalization of the means of production and the planned beginnings, and by no means the fact that the bureaucracy usurped command over the economy. On the contrary, bureaucratism, as a system, became the worst brake on the technical and cultural development of the country. ”This was veiled for a certain time by the fact that the Soviet economy was occupied for two decades with transplanting and assimilating the technology and organization of production in advanced capitalist countries. The period of borrowing and imitation still could, for better or for worse, be accommodated to bureaucratic automatism, i.e., the suffocation of all initiative and all creative urge. But the higher the economy rose, the more complex its requirements became, all the more unbearable became the bureaucratic regime. The constantly sharpening contradiction between them leads to uninterrupted political convulsions, to systematic annihilation of the most outstanding creative elements in all spheres of activity.” In. short, Stalin, far from leading any revolution, “second?” or otherwise, clamped a bureaucratic grip on the Soviet economy. The viability of the economic foundations laid by the 1917 revolution enabled the economy to develop despite the bureaucracy, whose caste interests and police methods conflict with the needs of socialist development. Whatever achievements Stalinism can claim in the technological progress of Soviet economy are a thousand times outweighed by the bureaucratic chains in which it shackles the economy, by its exclusion of the workers from the planning process and by the heavy toll its parasitism exacts from the national income. The facts show that Stalinism, far from playing a progressive role in the economy, functions as the biggest internal obstacle to the Soviet Union’s harmonious economic development.  Records his crimes Nevertheless, Deutscher does give a fairly complete picture of Stalin’s crimes, and the portrait of Stalin that emerges coincides on the whole with that drawn by Trotsky (from whose writings Deutscher has borrowed much). It shows Stalin’s development into a professional revolutionary, whose grasp of Marxism was never more than superficial and who gravitated in the direction of Menshevism in every crisis. It describes his rise to dictatorial power after Lenin’s death as the representative of a bureaucratic caste which leaned on the more backward elements in Soviet society and was strengthened by the defeats of the world revolution. It explains why and how he invented the anti-Marxist theory of “socialism in one country.” It discloses how he suppressed democracy in the Bolshevik Party, transformed the world communist movement into frontier guards for Soviet foreign policy, wiped out the Old Guard in the Moscow Trials. The later chapters, dealing with World War II, also tell of his pact with Hitler, his later relations with his Allied imperialist partners, and the empirical, opportunist policy he pursued throughout in his conduct of the war. More books recounting Stalin’s crimes against socialism are certainly needed to help educate the new generations and to counteract the flood of volumes depicting Stalin as arch-enemy of capitalism and organizer of world revolution. But Deutscher’s book cannot fulfill this need. For whatever qualities one may be ready to concede its popularization of some major, historical events are wholly negated by the interpretation Deutscher gives to the role of Stalinism as a whole. Is Stalinism revolutionary or counter-revolutionary? Does it, can it play a progressive role in the struggle for socialism, despite the reactionary methods it employs? Is Stalin’s position, in the modern scene comparable to that of Cromwell and Robespierre in the British and French bourgeois revolutions? No book on the subject that gives wrong answers to these questions can have any value for revolutionary workers, even if it contains accurate information on historical details. Deutscher gives the wrong answers. How they are wrong, and how they differ from those made by the Trotskyists, will be the subject of an article next week.   


Two main camps, broadly speaking, are engaged in a
struggle for the leadership of the anti-Jim Crow movement in the United
States. One camp, temporarily dominant, stands for “gradual reform”
through class collaboration; it includes most labor and Negro leaders,
practically all capitalist liberals and some capitalist conservatives.
The other camp, whose direct influence is much weaker, stands for
radical change through militant class struggle; its chief organized
expression is the Marxist movement, although large numbers of Negroes
and workers sympathize with some or many of its practical conclusions.
The reformist camp takes this position:
“We deplore Jim Crow and want to eliminate it. We
believe that this can be done, and should be done, within the framework
of capitalism and the two-party system. The way to achieve progress is
not by antagonizing those who control the country, but by persuading
them that Jim Crow is harmful, unjust and unnecessary. The facts show
that our approach is correct because the Negro has steadily been making
remarkable gains in all spheres of American life. Let us not become
impatient and throw away the method that has been tested and proved
successful. Let us continue to work as we have been doing, more
energetically of course, and through peaceful collaboration, appeals to
reason and willingness to compromise we will gradually but surely solve
the problem.”
The revolutionary camp takes this position:
“The only way to make progress against Jim Crow is by
fighting tooth and nail against those who profit by it, the capitalist
class, just as the only way to end Jim Crow is by removing its
fundamental cause, the capitalist system. Whatever lasting gains the
Negro people have made in the 20th century were won through struggle in
alliance with other progressive sections of the population,
particularly the working class, and not by collaboration with the
capitalist beneficiaries of Jim Crow; and that is how future gains will
be made too. We deny that the economic gains of recent years are
substantial, or that they will necessarily be permanent, or that they
automatically signify further gains, or that they prove the correctness
of the reformist program To win the maximum gains possible under
capitalism, and to abolish Jim Crow, we need new methods, a new
leadership and a new party based on the labor and Negro movements.” [1]
 
New Bible for Reformers
As can be seen, part of the controversy revolves around
the extent and nature of recent gains by the Negro people. Since the
end of World War II the reformists have talked about little else, for
this is their strongest debating point. Now they have a Bible too — a
report entitled Employment and Economic Status of Negroes in
the United States, prepared for the Senate Subcommittee on
Labor and Labor-Management Relations and published on Nov. 20, 1952.
The air has been thick since then with claims that need to be examined.
An introductory note in the report says:
“From all the information brought together, two
general facts seem to emerge. The first is that in almost every
significant economic and social characteristic that we can measure —
including length of life, education, employment and income — our Negro
citizens, as a whole, are less well off than our white citizens. The
second is that in almost every characteristic the differences between
the two groups have narrowed in recent years.”
(The second, naturally, was selected for priority and
the main emphasis in the headlines, news stories and editorial comment
of most of the capitalist press.)
In our opinion, the first of these general conclusi6ns, whose truth
no one can deny, is the more important of the two. The program of
gradual reform has had 8% decades since the Civil War to show what it
can do and yet 1950 found the Negro “less well off” than the white —
and that is an extreme understatement, as the statistics will show.
Nevertheless, since the reformists claim that the decade 1940-50 marked
such an acceleration of Negro progress that their policies have been
vindicated, it is necessary to examine the statistics supplied in the
report with a view to determining what changes took place in the status
of the Negro people during that decade, and what their implications are
for the future. [2]

According to Table 1, the average wage of the employed
Negro rose from $364 in 1939 to $1,295 in 1950, an increase of $931.
This is less than the average increase of the employed white in the
same period, $1,525. But since the Negro’s wage in the base year (1939)
was so much lower than that of the white, his smaller increase in
dollars works out as a bigger increase in percentages. In 1939 the
Negro’s wage represented 38% of the white’s, in 1950 it represented
52%. Thus this table shows a relative gain of 14% for the Negro in the
period considered.
This 14% figure is the most impressive in the entire report. The
table on average life expectancy shows a relative gain of only 5% for
Negro men and 8% for Negro women in the last 30 years; the table on
education shows a relative gain of 6% for the Negro from 1940 to 1950;
and the tables on occupational status vary too much from industry to
industry and between the sexes to permit an exact estimation. [4] Most of this article, therefore,
will be concerned with an evaluation of the maximum change hailed by
the reformists, the 14% figure on wage income.
Most of the comparisons in the report are between 1940 and 1950 — 10
years, not 11 as in the wage income table. This at once raises a
question: Why did the government statisticians omit the 1940 figures,
which are available, and use the 1939 figures instead? It may help us
to note here that if we compare the 10 year period 1939-49, we find a
relative gain of 7% — only one-half the gain shown for the 11 year
period. Could it be that a comparison of 1940 and 1950 — the standard
procedure in most of the tables, we repeat — would show a much less
imposing relative gain than the 14% shown for 1939-50? The compilers of
the report will have to answer that question. Meanwhile, we see how
greatly the final result can be changed by a slight alteration in the
years picked for comparison, and we should be put on our guard by the
arbitrariness of the choice made in this table.
That leads us directly to a much more basic objection: Comparisons
of this kind have only a limited value unless they are accompanied by
an understanding of the specific conditions that prevailed in the
different years compared. (How useful for example, are figures
comparing agricultural production in two different years if you don’t
know that one of them was a drought year?) We must know in what
respects the economic situation of 1939 resembled that of 1950, and in
what respects they differed. Otherwise we are in no position to
evaluate the 14% figure or the impression, fostered by the report, that
it establishes a general trend.
The 1930’s were the years of the great depression; despite some
relative recovery around the middle of the decade there was another
recession in 1937 and unemployment was still heavy in 1939 (averaging
9½ million). It may be asked: What significance does that have
for our study — didn’t unemployment affect whites as well as Negroes?
Of course it did, but not proportionally — the percentage of
unemployment was much higher among Negroes. Then it may be asked: But
what difference does that make in considering Table 1, which gives
average incomes only of the employed? It makes plenty of difference:
The depression not only produced proportionally greater unemployment
among Negroes, it also reduced the average “income of those Negroes who
managed to get or keep jobs proportionally more than the income of
employed whites. This resulted from two factors: discrimination against
Negroes in hiring, and the depression-born practice of replacing
Negroes with whites in the better-paid of the so-called “Negro jobs.”
Thus we have good reason to believe that so far as income went, the
Negro was relatively, as well as absolutely, worse off in 1940 (or
1939) than he was in 1930.
Now we cannot prove that statistically because, for some reason, the
report does not give 1930 figures on Negro and white income (although
it supplies 1930 figures in many other tables). Nevertheless there is
evidence strongly supporting our conclusion that Negro income fell
relatively during the 1930’s — statistics on employment (not contained
in the report). We take the figures on manufacturing because this was
amongst the best-paid employment open to Negroes. In 1930. Negroes made
up 7.3% of all employees in manufacturing. By 1940, the figure had
fallen to 5.0% — a drop of almost one-third. According to the final
report of the Fair Employment Practices Committee in 1947, the 1940
figure was even lower than that of 1910, which was 6.2%! In other
words, 1939 was not a “normal” year for Negroes in relative employment
or in relative income, but represented the lowest point reached in both
fields in at least 10 and possibly 20 or 30 years.
Consequently, the 14% relative gain computed by using 1939 as the
base year does not show the overall ware trend but a temporary
fluctuation. What actually happened in 1939-50 was that the Negro
recovered some of the ground lost in the depression. (His proportion in
manufacturing rose from 5.1% in 1940 to 6.8% in 1950 — which was still
below the figure in 1930.) Was the Negro relatively better off in
income in 1950 than in 1930? The government will have to release the
1930 statistics before we can answer that question with certainty. If
he was relatively better off in 1950 than 1930, how much? Again the
answer will have to await the release of the statistics, but one thing
is sure — the figure will be much less than 14%.
Whatever else Table 1 does, it does not show the overall wage trend
of recent times. A comparison of 1930 (when the depression was just
beginning) with 1950 (when employment was high) would provide a far
more accurate picture of the over-all trend than this table (which is
based on comparison of a depression year with a year of relative
prosperity).
Having filled in the background that is needed to assess the
relative gains shown during the 1940’s, we must now seek an explanation
for those gains. A good place to begin is with data on shifts in the
population.

Another table, which we shall not reproduce here,
“reveals the shift of the Negro population, during this wartime decade
(1940-50), from Southern to Northern, Central and Western States. A
resulting decline in the number and proportion of Negroes in the
population occurred in the Southern States of West Virginia, Georgia,
Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and Oklahoma. The Middle
Atlantic, East North Central, and Pacific States had the most
appreciable increases in their Negro population, and the percentage
increases for Negroes far exceed those of the white population.
Michigan’s Negro population more than doubled, while its white
population increased only 17%. In California the Negro population
increased 116%, compared with a 50% increase among whites.” Other data
dealing with population shifts in the big cities show heavy increases,
especially in non-Southern cities. These figures firmly establish the
shift in large numbers of Negroes from farm to city or town and out of
the South and the fact that proportionally this shift was greater among
Negroes than whites in the last decade.
Simultaneously came a shift in the proportion of people employed in
agriculture:

These figures show that on the whole the proportion of

The greater urbanization and proletarianization of Negroes shown in
Tables 2 and 3 are a fact of tremendous economic, political and
sociological importance, but here we want to discuss only their effects
on relative incomes.
To begin with, wages are higher in the North and West than in the
South; a steel worker who moves from Alabama to Pennsylvania gets
higher wages for the same work. Similarly, wages are higher in urban
than rural areas; a tenant farmer or sharecropper who moves to the city
and becomes a factory worker also gets higher wages. Since more Negroes
migrated relatively than whites, the Negro’s relative income would have
risen as a result of his migration even if wage rates for all
occupations had remained absolutely stationary during the last decade.
Consequently one part (maybe even the major part) of the 14% relative
gain is due solely to the existence of wage differentials between urban
and rural areas and between North and South, and not to a narrowing of
Negro-white wage differentials within any of these areas.
The migrations enable us to judge the validity of the 14% figure as
a guide to relative changes not in wages but in real income during the
last decade:

Not only wages but living costs are higher in urban and
non-Southern areas. Negroes migrated more than whites, so this factor
affected them more. In terms of real income or purchasing power,
therefore, the relative gain must have been less than 14%.
Many people employed on the land receive part of their income “in
kind” (board, lodging, produce). But this part of the income of the
1939 farmer who became a worker by 1950 is not included in the Table 1
figures, and so the increase in his real income is not actually as
great as those figures would indicate. Since Negro urbanization was
proportionally higher than white urbanization, this points to the need
for making another reduction in that 14% figure.
The last decade was marked by inflation, which strikes at the
living standards of both whites and Negroes but always hits the
lowest-income groups the hardest (who must spend more of their incomes
on food and other necessities which have risen most in price). Since
Negro wage income is shown to be only 52% of that of the whites at the
end of the decade, this means that the Negro’s real standard of living
(as distinct from money income) was adversely affected by inflation
more than that of the white, and that in terms of real income the 14%
figure must be reduced further. [6]
 

“Progress” in the Last Decade
Next we turn attention to what happened to relative
income within the last decade because it throws clearer light
on the causes for the change in the decade as a whole and at the same
time further refutes claims about the “steadiness” of Negro progress.
Table 1 has already shown that the Negro’s relative wage suddenly fell
7% in the single year 1948-1949, with the beginning of the depression
that was staved off only by increased cold war arms spending. But there
are other statistics in the report that are even more illuminating:




Table 4 — Median money income of
families, 1945 and 1947-50

Table 4 indicates that the high point in the relative
gains did not come at the end of the decade but in the middle, when the
figure reached 57%, “a comparative level that has not yet again been
reached in recent years,” as the report states. This loss of 3% among
Negro families as a whole from 1945 to 1950 was even exceeded among
urban Negro families which fell from 67% to 58% between 1945 and 1949
(1950 figures for this category are not supplied).
 
Causes for the Changes
Now we have the clues to the two main causes of the
changes of the last decade. One was the mechanization of agriculture,
which drove many people off the land, especially in the South, and gave
an added impetus to the migrations and urbanization. The other was the
war needs of the capitalist class, which erased the unemployment
prevalent at the beginning of the decade. The requirements of war, and
structural changes in the agricultural economy — these were the primary
factors responsible for whatever relative gain may have taken place,
and they operated independently of the will of the reformists and of
the needs of the masses, white or Negro.
When we call these the primary factors we don’t mean that they were
the only ones. The Negro people themselves intervened effectively at
many points. It was they who pulled up stakes and moved to new areas
(often against the advice of timid leaders who feared that migration to
the cities would provoke anti-Negro riots). It was they who won
concessions by independent action, by struggles inside the plants where
they broke clown some of the barriers to upgrading and hiring, and by
struggles outside the plants through organizations like the March on
Washington Movement whose threats to undertake militant mass action did
more to win a wartime FEPC order from Roosevelt than all the efforts of
the reformists combined. It was the labor movement, acting mainly in
self-defense to be sure, that saw to it that the newly-migrated Negro
workers were paid the prevailing wage scales, more or less, in the
plants under union contract.
We have no wish to minimize these other factors — on the contrary —
because these struggles confirm the basic outlook of the Marxists, not
the reformists; our aim here is rather to stress the conditions which
enabled these factors to operate with some success. In fact, we can
even afford to attribute a measure of participation in the process to
the reformists, who tried in their own way to persuade the ruling class
to lift some of the obstacles to Negro employment, which they decried
as harmful to the war effort, morally unjust, etc.; but, this doesn’t
mean the tail wagged the clog. (The reformists also had a negative
effect for wherever they had the influence they restrained the masses
from independent struggle in a crisis where such struggle could have
induced even greater concessions from the ruling class.)
We cannot determine statistically which of the two primary factors
was the more decisive, but we conclude that it was the war. Because as
soon as the war ended, the Negro’s relative gains ended too, and were
succeeded by relative losses. When the cold war began to be heated up,
further relative gains were recorded in certain spheres, but not enough
to make up for the losses of the second half of the decade as a whole.
At this point we must also ask the reformists: If the over-all gains of
the decade are to be credited to your policies, won’t you also have to
take the credit for the losses of the last five years, or explain why
your policies did not work during 1945-50? (This period, incidentally,
coincided with the Truman administration’s conduct of the noisiest
anti-Jim Crow reform demagogy in the history of the country.)
Turning now to a discussion of what the future holds, we begin with
the report’s data on unemployment:




Table 5 — Unemployment Status of the
civilian population, annual averages,
1947, 1949 and 1951
(percent distribution).




 


1947


1949


1951




Nonwhite


5.4%


8.2%


4.8%




White


3.3   


5.2   


2.8   




This shows, the report says, that the average rate of
unemployment for Negroes has been “more than 50%” above that for whites
in recent years. (70% above in 1951.) “Although the rate was about 5%
for Negroes in 1951, compared with 3% for whites, about the same
relative improvement had taken place since 1949 when the economic
situation was less favorable.” (Again we must ask why the authors of
the report omitted the 1940 or 1939 figures, which are in their
possession. Because a comparison with the latest data would show a
considerable relative rise for Negroes in the average rate of
unemployment during the last decade?)
The same unfavorable proportions are shown in the data about
seniority. A survey in 1951 showed that “Negro workers had been on
their current jobs an average of 2.4 years, compared with an average of
3.5 years among white workers” — that is, seniority among white workers
is almost 50% higher than among Negroes. Moreover, “20% of urban white
men and only 13% of urban Negroes had worked on their current jobs
since before January 1940.”
Thus if a depression takes place before a global war, Negro workers
as usual will be first and hardest hit, with calamitous results for all
the relative gains of the last decade.
But let’s grant that the most likely variant for the next period is
not depression but continuation of the cold war leading to another
world war. Does that lend support to the vista, held out by the
reformists, of continued relative progress for the Negroes at
approximately the same rate as in the 1940’s, or anywhere near that
rate? Our answer must be a flat No because the special circumstances of
the last decade will not be operating in the next period, or not with
the same force. The same rate of relative gain will not continue
because the new base year (1950) is not a depression year such as 1939
was. It will not continue because the gap in urbanization has already
almost been closed (61% for Negroes to 64% for whites) and while
further migration will take plate it will be on a reduced scale and
therefore will not have the same impact on relative incomes as in the
40’s. And most of all it will not continue because World War III is
going to be a lot different from World War II.
 
Prospects If War Comes
Last time the US had strong allies abroad and a neutral
if not friendly attitude from many other countries; next time its
allies will be neither strong nor dependable and Washington will enter
the war with the hate and suspicion of most of the world. Last time the
fighting was conducted far from US shores; next time the US will learn
how it feels to receive as well as give bombings. Last time the war,
beginning in a depression, produced a switch from mass unemployment to
full employment and an economic revival which permitted the capitalists
to grant some concessions to keep the population at home from getting
too restless; next time the war will begin when production will already
be at near-capacity levels and the working class will already be fully
employed and therefore will not produce the same psychological effects
on the people. On the contrary, the counter-revolutionary attempt to
subjugate the Soviet Union, China, Eastern Europe, the anti-capitalist
workers of Europe and the anti-imperialist masses of Asia. South
America, the Middle East and Africa will strain the economy to the
breaking point, impose crushing burdens on the American people and
generate discontent and resistance at home as well as abroad.
The inevitable tendency then will be not to grant but to withdraw
concessions from the masses. The ruling class will seek to freeze wages
solidly; to conscript labor and chain the workers to their jobs; to
regiment the unions and turn them into agencies of the state to
maintain labor discipline: to double and triple taxes until they
consume a majority of the workers’ income; and to set up a
military-police dictatorship to put down all opposition to this
program. Those who preach and practice class collaboration, those whose
first allegiance is to capitalism rather than the working class, will
be utterly unable to halt or reverse this tendency even if they should
want to; only the methods of militant class struggle will be able to
stop the onslaughts of reaction.
And what will happen to the economic status of the Negro people? It
is of course conceivable that, even in such circumstances Negroes at
first might register slight relative gains in income where they were
drafted out of inessential jobs and into war production. But that would
be both the beginning and end of it. With strictly enforced
wage-freezing and staggering taxes, the real income and living
standards of the people would go down and not up. The relative status
of the Negro would be frozen for the duration of a war that everyone
expects to be as prolonged as it will be terrible, and all efforts to
change his status would be branded “subversive” and punished by the
heavy hand of the state.
 
No Hope in Reformist Program
Thus if a depression signifies the rapid loss of all
recent relative gains by the Negro, war means absolute losses for white
and Negro workers, with the Negro’s relative status fixed and frozen,
at best, for an indefinite period. Either way, the reformist
perspective holds out little hope to the Negro for genuine progress in
the present or the achievement of equality in the future.
In essence, the advocates of gradual reform exaggerate the relative
gains of the past and ascribe them to the wrong causes in order to
conciliate the Negro with his oppressor and to divert him from the
militant action which can both alleviate and end his oppression. This
program has always been a hoax; now it is becoming a trap too. If it
was harmful in the past, it is doubly harmful today because the United
States is approaching a fateful turning point. The future, as we have
tried to show, will not be a mere repetition of the past. In the
absence of a social upheaval led by the labor movement, the war will
bring a savage dictatorship which the ruling class will have no desire
to relax When or if the war ends.
In the pamphlet The Jim Crow Murder of Mr. and Mrs. Harry
T. Moore, we related the prospects of the Negroes in the US to
the fate of the Jews in Europe during the last war and demonstrated
that “conditions can arise which will wipe out in a single decade all
the gains that have been painfully accumulated in a century of
strenuous effort.” Such conditions will flourish luxuriantly in the
soil of the reaction that will accompany the next war. Instead of
continuing progress, the next period can see the Negro people used as
scapegoats for the capitalist class and menaced with the loss of all
their liberties and even with mass extermination. These dangers cannot
be wished out of existence by shutting eyes and covering ears and
reciting twisted statistics: they must be reckoned with and actively
combatted. For this task the reformists and their program are worse
than useless; they get in the way of the job that has to be done.
This article is mainly negative because its aim is to refute certain
misconceptions. But the perspective that Marxism offers the Negro
people is neither negative nor pessimistic. Capitalism, which looks so
powerful and imposing in this country today although it is the only
part of the world capitalist system that has any stability whatever, is
headed for its doom. It will not be any more successful than Hitler in
conquering the world, and like him will probably break its neck in the
process. The convulsions and crises arising out of the drive to war or
the war itself will radicalize the American people; they will also
provide the American people with opportunities to check the assaults on
their living standards and liberties, and take the political power and
the fate of the nation out of the hands of the capitalist minority.
For this a new party is needed; the sooner the job of building an
independent labor party is started, the sooner, smoother and less
costly the transfer of power will be. The American workers in alliance
with the Negro people, the poor farmers and the lower middle classes
are just the ones to do this job. When they do it, the economic roots
of racial oppression will be eradicated, the Negro people will secure
the equality that capitalism has stubbornly denied them in the 90 years
since the Emancipation Proclamation, and Jim Crow will become a memory
to puzzle future generations.
 



Two days before Christmas, Parade, the
Sunday picture magazine, devoted an entire page to a report from Key
West, Fla., where President Truman had just completed another of his
many vacations. It was the story of a 12-year old boy named Johnny
Lawler, who had been encouraged by his parents to hang around for a
chance to see Truman, and who finally succeeded and even shook Truman’s
hand and then was so thrilled that he did not wash his own hand for
several days. Johnny was quoted as asking his father, “Say, how did Mr.
Truman get to be President?” By working hard, his father replied, and
then Johnny said, “I’ll do the same because some day I want to be
President.”
There is something horrible in the thought that people are actually
educating their children to emulate a man like Truman, the biggest
strikebreaker in US history, the one who ruthlessly gave the order to
murder hundreds of thousands of helpless civilians with the atom bomb;
the hypocrite who advocated civil rights laws to get elected and then
dropped them like a hot potato; the initiator of a witch hunt that is
destroying our civil liberties.
Truman worked hard, all right — he worked hard obeying the orders of
a crooked machine politician named Pendergast, and he has been working
hard since then obeying the orders of the capitalist class, up to and
including the order to intervene in a so-called police action that has
already cost the US over 100,000 admitted casualties in Korea.
Johnny Lawler would be far better off if he hitched his wagon to
another star. And what a star there was in his own state — a Negro,
unknown to almost everyone until his death, a man who never committed
any crimes but who also became great by working hard. That was Harry T.
Moore, a hard worker, but one who worked on the side of the people and
not against them.
 
Harry Moore: A Truly Noble Man
It seems a shame that we never heard of Harry T. Moore
until after Christmas night, when his life and his wife’s life were
ended by a bomb that blew up their home in Mims, Florida. Because he
was a truly great and noble human being, the kind of man we should look
up to for guidance in how to live our lives, a man whose memory we
should keep forever fresh and green.
He was a school principal, and better off than most Negroes in the
South. But he was not content to think only of himself. He joined the
fight to win equal salaries for Negro teachers, and for doing that was
fired from his job. That would have silenced some people, as it has
intimidated many teachers of liberal or radical views and others
menaced or victimized by the witch hunt. But it did not frighten Harry
T. Moore.
On the contrary, it increased his determination to fight for
justice. He became more active than ever in the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People and in struggles to win and
protect the right to vote for Negroes in his state. And when he was
confronted with the Groveland “rape” frameup, he became a thorn in the
flesh of the white supremacists and Ku Kluxers and their protectors in
high office. He went around organizing and speaking at scores of
meetings, fearlessly defending the Groveland victims and boldly
demanding that McCall, the lyncher with a sheriff’s badge, should be
tried for the murder of Samuel Shepherd.
 
Knew What He Faced
We know now that he was taking his life into his hands
when he did these things. He must have known it too. But it did not
stop him. His mother says that when she cautioned him to be more
careful not long ago, he replied,
“Every advancement comes by way of sacrifice, and if
I sacrifice my life or my health I still think it is my duty for my
race.”
That is why it is correct to call Harry T. Moore a
martyr of the Negro struggle and of the general struggle of the working
people for a better world, he saw his duty and he did it, despite the
costs it entailed. He wanted to live too and to be happy, but he could
not be happy unless he offered his resistance to the misery and
injustice around him. In other words, he was a really moral man,
setting an example that should shine brightly for all time for the
youth of all races. He was a true son of great predecessors — of people
like Nat Turner and Harriet Tubman and John Brown and others who were
ready to risk their lives in the fight against oppression. We would be
ingrates, unworthy of the sacrifice he made, if we were content to
merely mourn his passing and then forget about him instead of devoting
ourselves to avenge his death and to complete the struggle he led so
well.
 
Misleading Figures on Lynching
The Nation (Jan. 5) was absolutely
correct when it insisted that such crimes as the murder of Harry T.
Moore “cannot be understood as senseless acts of depraved or prejudiced
individuals. On the contrary, they were essentially political crimes,
crimes deliberately committed for a purpose.” And the purpose cannot be
completely understood without examinatiort of a new trend that has
appeared in the last few years.
At the end of 1951 the Tuskegee Institute, a Negro institution which
issues annual lynching figures, announced that the total of lynchings
last year was — one. This report was widely publicized here and abroad
by the propagandists of capitalism; for them this constituted proof
that lynchings are diminishing year by year, that America is more and
more becoming the land of freedom and equality for the Negro people,
and that one of these days we will wake up and find that they are
treated just like other people.
They would be very happy if they could got the 15 million American
Negroes and the colored people who form a majority of the earth’s
population to believe in this picture of progress that goes ever onward
and upward until the arrival of the millenium. Because if what they
said was true, it might not be necessary to fight to end the
Jim Crow system — maybe people could just afford to sit back and wait
for it to die a natural death.
But it is a lie. The reason the capitalists and their political en
and boys in Washington go to the trouble of peddling this lie is that
they have set themselves the objective of dominating the whole world.
Part of their program for achieving this depends on force — economic
force through the dollars they are pumping into the dying capitalist
system all over the world, military force through armament that they
are trying to impose on unwilling countries in Europe, Asia and the
Middle East. But part also depends on propaganda — the propaganda that
the US is the champion and paragon of democracy.
The colored people abroad find that hard to swallow.
“If you are such lovers of democracy,” they ask,
“then how is it that you have become the partner of so many lifelong
bitter enemies of democracy like Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, Franco,
the Nazi and Japanese generals and most of the other dictators who are
not behind the iron curtain?”
Along with that question goes another:
“If you love democracy so much, why do you treat
Negroes as second-class citizens, deny most of them the right to vote,
discriminate against them at the hiring gate or bar them from the
better jobs when you do hire them, subject them to humility and
brutality, segregate them in the armed forces and in so many parts of
your educational system, deny them the protection of anti-lynching and
anti-poll tax laws — why, if you love democracy so much and talk to us
about it so much, don’t you practice what you preach?”
This makes the US ruling class, its politicians,
diplomats and Voice of America squirm like fish on a hook.
And needless to say, the representatives of the bureaucrats in the
Kremlin never miss a chance, inside the United Nations and outside, to
make them squirm some more. Many people, including some “radicals” who
expect capitalism to end Jim Crow, wonder why the US government does
not rid itself of this embarrassment, disarm foreign suspicions and
deprive the Kremlin of one of its most effective propaganda themes. All
they would have to do is quit discriminating against Negroes and begin
treating them the same way as other citizens. But they don’t do it, for
reasons to be discussed later. Instead, they seek to get around their
embarrassment by juggling figures to show that lynching is diminishing
and conditions are improving, etc.
When we say this is a lie, we do not mean to challenge the official
lynching figures compiled every year. It is true that they have
declined temporarily. What we mean is that lynching has assumed new
forms. Everyone knows that lynchings are violence resulting in death
committed by a mob, by more than a few people — if only one person does
the killing, it is listed by the Tuskegee Institute as a murder and not
a lynching. (Harry T. Moore was not officially listed as a lynch
victim, presumably because it has not been proved that more than one
person killed him.) But there is another and more crucial aspect to
lynching — its purpose. The purpose is not so much to take a life —
that can just as easily be done by so-called legal procedure, in a Jim
Crow court, that is, by “legal lynching.” The purpose of a lynching is
not so much to take a life as it is to frighten, terrorize, silence,
demoralize other people who are permitted to go on living, but who arc
expected to cringe as long as they live and not dare to organize or
vote or go to court — just to live and work like a mule for the benefit
of others. That is the real aim of a lynching, and if it does not have
that effect it is not considered a success.
 
New Trend in Anti-Negro Terror
The point can be illustrated by the Groveland case. In
Groveland, Lake County, Fla., a large number of Negroes were working
and living under conditions of virtual peonage, a system about half-way
between slave labor and wage labor. After the war the Negro workers
began to complain about their conditions and talk about doing something
to improve them. When their employers heard about this, they decided to
do something drastic to throw the fear of god into their employees.
That was the background of the Groveland case in 1949, and when a white
woman yelled rape the employers had just what they wanted. They
unloosed a reign of terror that lasted over a week; Negro homes were
burned, Negroes were shot at if they ventured out of doors, and finally
400 Negro families had to flee out of the county. One Negro was shot
dead by a posse, three others were almost lynched and later were
convicted; one was given life imprisonment, two were sentenced to
death; when the Supreme Court ordered a new trial for the latter, a
sheriff shot them in cold blood, murdering one and leaving the other
for dead. But it was not these victims the ruling class was most
concerned about — they wanted blood and some bodies burning in the
electric chair so that they could point to them and remind the
remaining, living Negroes of what they could expect if they tried to
alter the wonderful American way of life as it is practiced in the
South.
 
Real Aim: To Frighten the Living
To frighten the living — that is the real aim of
lynching. When that is understood, we can see that there may be less of
the old-style type of lynchings, where mobs are used, but that
lynchings have continued as much as before, only in new forms. Today,
when they want to achieve the purpose of lynchings, they send out only
two or three men to shoot down a Negro who will serve as an example to
others, or they may even send out only one man, armed with a bomb,
which he can throw under a house where people are sleeping at night.
And in some cases they use the police instead. Because these people who
are so brave about murdering sleeping men and women don’t like to take
any risks, and even small vigilante committees face a risk that their
victim may resist. But with the police taking over the function of the
lynch mob there is practically no risk. The police have always been
noted for their brutality toward Negroes. Now, in addition, in
ever-increasing numbers, they are killing Negroes too, in the North and
the South.
It is estimated that in the city of Birmingham alone almost 100
Negroes have been shot or beaten to death on the streets or in the
police stations during the last 2½ years alone. Nobody knows
what the national total is, but it surely equals any annual total of
“official” lynchings recorded in the US since the early days of the Ku
Klux Klan. It is not a matter of punishing individual Negroes or of
letting the police work off their sadistic frustrations — the main aim
is to paralyze the members of the Negro community with fright, to make
them shudder every time they see a cop, to keep the memory of broken
and bloody bodies on their minds so that they will be afraid to talk
back or stand up for their rights. In other words, the same aim as the
old-style lynchings, only now committed under guise of law, now
protected by the police badge and uniform, now masked as “resisting an
officer” or “trying to escape.”
That is one of the new trends in the struggle for Negro equality.
The Negro people have been pressing forward — it is estimated that two
million of them will go to the polls in the South this year as compared
with about one million in 1948. Unable to sweet-talk them into
accepting second-class citizenship, the ruling class and its political
agents have decided to beat them into submission. It is impossible to
exaggerate the dangers presented by the new forms of lynching. If they
are not stopped where they are already being committed, then they will
spread into every state and city where the ruling class wants to keep
the Negro people down — that is, every state and city where Negroes
live.
 
Danger Evident Not Only to Radicals
Revolutionary socialists are not the only ones who
understand what is happening. The Psychology Department of the City
College of New York, 20 educators, sent a wire to Truman last November
after the sheriff of Lake County took the two handcuffed Groveland
defendants for a ride and shot them. They noted that the pattern for
denying Negroes their constitutional rights has shifted from mob
violence “to the more subtle forms of quasi-legal executions or
violence at the hands of ‘law enforcement’ officers.” The new pattern,
they said, would give “the aura of official sanction to racial murders”
and would expose all the people to “the dangers of a capricious,
jungle-like state.” (This is an acute observation, because once the
cops get such powers of life and death in their hands they will not
confine their use to Negroes but will employ them against whites as
well.) And they warned that “only the most immediate and strongest
action of the federal government can prevent the legal murder of a
great many more Negroes in the near future.” Events have already begun
to confirm this warning.
Another conservative source, Walter White, in his annual report for
the NAACP, declared:
“At times during the year justice and human rights in
America seemed to be standing still or even moving backward ... we saw
in our country a resurgence of violence — rioting, home burning,
bombings, police brutality and mockery of the revered American concept
of ‘equal justice under law.’ Cicero, Martinsville, Groveland,
Birmingham, Miami and Mims, the horror names of 1951, drove home more
strongly than ever the continuing and increasing need for the NAACP.”
 
Why No Action from Washington?
The International Executive Board of the CIO Auto
Workers — not one radical among them — protested the Groveland killing,
the murder of an NAACP member who had filed suit for the right to vote
in Louisiana and was shot down by a deputy sheriff, and the murder of a
Negro steward at sea by a white captain. These crimes were designated
as signs of “an intensification of terroristic aggression against
Negroes by officers charged with upholding and enforcement of the law.”
Urging Attorney General McGrath to arrest, indict and try the killers
for murder, the UAW Board wrote:
“Failure to take such action subverts all of our
lofty professions of democratic principles. The hour is late. Action
now is imperative.”
The hour certainly is late, but no action has been
forthcoming, despite thousands of appeals to Truman for the government
to step into the picture and do something to stop the terrorism. Not
one legal or semi-legal lyncher has been punished. Not one cop has been
fired. Not one bomb-thrower has been apprehended. The strongest
government in the world seems to be. helpless, or else tries to give
that impression. The mighty FBI has found nothing. The Department of
Justice can’t seem to get the wheels of justice moving. Are they really
so inefficient?
The answer is that it all depends on whom they are hunting. When
they want to catch a radical, nothing seems to stop them. The whole
machinery of the government is thrown into high gear, thousands of cops
and FBI agents labor ceaselessly, no financial expense is too high,
they lap wires and open mail, they set up a stoolpigeon system
extending across the whole country. And they get results — when they
really want them. So when they don’t get results we have good reason to
believe they don’t want them.
They arrest radicals and prosecute them and send them to jail, not
for employing force and violence — there has not been a single case of
this kind — but for allegedly conspiring to advocate force and
violence, a frameup assault on the Bill of Rights. But when it comes to
those who do not advocate but clearly commit force and violence, the
government seems paralyzed, bumbling, impotent. They are great at
hounding people whose only crime is that they express their opinions
but a complete dud when it comes to catching and punishing fascistic
elements who commit crimes in violation of all the federal, state and
local laws. Liberals think this is accidental, but it is not. The truth
is that the government is not really disturbed by fascist elements
while it is afraid of ideas and free speech and free press. This gives
a better and sharper insight into the true character of the government
and the capitalist ruling class than can be gotten in almost any other
way.
 
Our Warnings Confirmed
What is the government doing about the murder of Mr. and
Mrs. Harry T. Moore? Look first of all at Truman, the so-called great
civil libertarian and humanitarian. Not one word. He can’t be bothered
by such trifles. When US airmen fly over Hungarian territory in
violation of international law — you can imagine what would happen if a
Soviet or Hungarian plane flew over US territory without permission —
and then are arrested and fined, there is a great hubbub, Truman
demands restitution and firm action, and even after they are released
he vindictively demands that the case be taken before the UN. But when
people are murdered in his own country, in the state where he takes his
vacations, Truman is silent (and no newspaper reporter questions him
about it at his press conferences). Not that it would mean anything if
he did say something about the Moore case because he has proved that
his promises cannot be trusted anyhow. Action speaks louder than words.
And the inaction of the Truman administration also speaks louder than
words.
Attorney General McGrath promises “the full facilities of the FBI.”
Eventually he sends down two (2) FBI agents, who, when added to those
already stationed in Florida, make a grand total of nine (9). Which is
less than one-tenth as many as he set into action like bloodhounds when
four Stalinists convicted under the Smith Act jumped bail last summer.
Evidently expressing opinions that Truman and McGrath do not like is a
more heinous crime than murder. The FBI agents in Florida have achieved
exactly nothing. The whole thing is a farce. Because even if they
should arrest someone for “violating the federal civil rights” of Mr.
and Mrs. Moore, the penalty — the maximum penalty — would be one year
in prison and a few thousand dollars in fine! (Provided a Southern jury
could be found to convict the defendant.) That is the way the
government acts, that is the way it intends to keep acting — unless and
until it is compelled to do otherwise by the mass pressure of the
American people.
When Harry T. Moore was murdered, the Socialist Workers Party
immediately sounded the alarm. It warned that if his killers were not
punished, they would feel free to spread their violence to maintain
white supremacy and to extend their attacks to white workers and the
labor movement. This warning was confirmed almost as soon as it was
uttered. Recent issues of The Militant, by printing a
number of small news items that are lost in the back pages of most
papers, have shown that the bomb is joining TV and comic books as
symbols of American capitalist culture (which is ironical when we
recall that the favorite cartoon stereotype of a revolutionist used to
be a man with a bomb in his hand).
A white evangelist in Florida is warned that he will get the “Mims
treatment” if he does not stop preaching against sin so vigorously
(Moore’s home was in Mims). A crusader against vice in Alabama comes
home to find his house in smoke and his son blown 30 feet through the
air by a bomb, and he decides to move his family out of the state (why
he sent them to Florida for protection from bombs is a mystery). The
white sheriff of a North Carolina county complains that his deputies
cannot do their job at night in the rural areas because the Klan has
been flogging so many people that the residents have become jittery and
start firing their shotguns as soon as they hear a noise outside; the
sheriff says if this kind of thing goes on, why, it will not be
possible for his deputies to preserve law and order much longer. The
United Press reports a dynamite explosion near a Negro night club in
Dallas, Tex., and calls it the third such “apparently pointless”
bombing in less than a month. And now the scene shifts North, to
Chicago, where a black-powder bomb is exploded outside the new
headquarters of the AFL Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen’s
Union, shattering 40 windows and rocking the whole area; the police
began an investigation, of course — not of the labor haters, not of the
anti-union racists or the White Circle League, but of the CIO United
Packinghouse Workers Union!
 
What Is Being Done?
What is being done by the groups that are directly
affected by this new wave of terrorism? The NAACP, which is most
vitally involved, denounced the outrage, offered a reward for the
killers of Mr. and Mrs. Moore, held memorial meetings for them, and
urged McGrath to appoint a special prosecutor and grand jury (which he
refused to do). And then, two weeks after the bombing, it voted to
consult the labor leaders for a nationwide work stoppage, something it
had never done before and something which it did almost on the spur of
the moment under the pressure of the mass indignation over the Moore
case. All these measures were justified and progressive — but
inadequate.
The leaders of the labor movement too know they are involved, and
knew it before the bombing of the Chicago AFL union. They know that
union organizers and members will be next on the death list, that the
forces behind lynch terror are the same ones that seek to smash unions.
But beyond sending a few telegrams of protest, they do nothing. An
editorial in the Jan. 9 AFL News-Reporter concludes
by “wondering” if maybe “reactionaries everywhere won’t stop to think
whether stirring up race hatred in order to win an election is worth
the damage it helps to cause.” This is not a summons for the people to
fight the reactionaries but an appeal to the reactionaries to think
over what they are doing and decide if the terrorism really benefits
them — as if the reactionaries do not know what they are doing.
The Socialist Workers Party takes an altogether different approach.
Farrell Dobbs, National Chairman and presidential candidate of the SWP,
wrote a letter to the NAACP, AFL and CIO and 22 other powerful national
organizations scheduled to meet in Washington on Feb. 17-18 to lobby
for a change in Senate rules that make it possible to filibuster all
civil rights legislation to death. Speaking on behalf of the SWP, Dobbs
urged them to revise the plans for their conference — to turn it into a
broader affair, to summon a mass march on Washington by tens of
thousands instead of staging a lobby with a few hundred polite
representatives; to call mass meetings and demonstrations in cities all
over the country at the same time; to endorse the proposal for a
nationwide work stoppage; and to support the idea of forming defense
guards to protect lives and homes and liberties which the authorities
have failed to protect.
 
The Need for Defense Guards
The proposal for defense guards originated in Florida,
and not with the SWP. For several months in Miami bombs have been
thrown or planted in Negro housing projects, Jewish synagogues, and a
Catholic church. When the police failed to stop this, here is what
happened, according to the Jan. 2 New York Times:
“Members of the Jewish War Veterans recently
suggested that 325 of their members be deputized to guard synagogues,
but this was turned down after several rabbis had issued a statement
declaring that to resort to ‘vigilante action at this time is to
succumb to hysteria and panic’.”
The subsequent killing of Mr. and Mrs. Moore,
undoubtedly encouraged when the racists saw they could act with
impunity in Miami, proves how blind those rabbis were to put their
confidence in the police. In the first place, defense guards need not
be deputized; when needed, they can and should be, formed without
getting the recognition or approval of the police, who usually act in
connivance with the lynchers anyhow. In the second place, formation of
defense guards is not “vigilante action” but its very opposite —
protection against vigilante action. And in the third place it is not
panic or hysteria to protect your life when the police fail to do so —
but good sense.
The bombers respect only those who can oppose them effectively; they
will think twice about going out to take another life when they see
Negroes and Jews and workers banding together and promising to resist.
Even the police will think it over before clubbing a helpless victim if
they know he has friends who will come to his aid. Without ever having
heard of the Socialist Workers Party, the Jewish veterans in Miami
sensed this; so did 18 whites who stood armed guard around the church
of the preacher threatened with the Mims treatment in Jacksonville; and
so did the Negroes who formed a guard around the home of a Negro farmer
in North Carolina after a bomb had been exploded there.
 
What Impedes the Leaders?
Farrell Dobbs’ proposals were not answered by the labor,
Negro, liberal and civic organizations. But they made it clear that
they rejected them by changing the name of their lobbying conference in
February to the “Leadership Conference on Civil Rights” — an obvious
refusal to call for mass action. But what about the proposal for a
nationwide work stoppage, which was made first by the NAACP itself? The
NAACP authorized the setting up of a committee to consult the labor
leaders. What happened? Was it set up, and if it was set up, why isn’t
it functioning? If it is functioning, why is the NAACP so silent about
the whole thing, which was their idea and not ours? If the labor
leaders refuse to go along with the proposal, why doesn’t the NAACP
announce this so that the people can do something about it? Why, if
they say this is a situation of crisis, don’t they act accordingly?
What are they waiting for?
The answer can be found by examining the new form of propaganda that
both Negro and labor leaders have become very fond of in recent years.
This has already been done in The Militant, but it
bears repetition and amplification. Today this propaganda is being
applied to just about every public issue that can be thought of. When
Truman asks for another five billions in new taxes, he seeks to justify
this unpopular demand by its necessity for the struggle against
communism. But his Republican opponents say hew taxes are out of the
question for the same reason — they would hurt the economy and weaken
the struggle against communism. When Philip Murray asks for a steel
wage increase, he explains it is needed so the steel workers can
contribute their maximum effort to the fight against Stalin. Fairless
of US Steel retorts that a wage increase would undermine the steel
industry, which would please no one so much as Stalin. Of course the
class struggle continues just the same. The steel workers are not
impressed with Fairless’ arguments, nor he with theirs. This shows that
propaganda has certain limits, and while it can mix things up it cannot
change the realities of social life and struggle.

 
False Propaganda Paralyzes Action
But it can mix things up, which is why it must be paid
some attention when it is applied to the Negro question, where the
argument runs like this: Jim Crow, discrimination, segregation,
bombings are all crimes because they help Stalin, and should be ended
so that Negroes will be able and willing to go all-out in the crusade
against communism. This was the theme sounded over and over by Philip
Murray and Walter Reuther at the last CIO convention, and given a
timely application by Walter White, secretary of the NAACP, when he
said the murder of Harry T. Moore was “one of the greatest services
that could have been performed for Joe Stalin.”
The duty of leaders, labor or Negro, is to educate the people, teach
them to know causes and effects — otherwise, no lasting progress is
possible. Specifically, it is their job to teach the masses what causes
Jim Crow oppression, who benefits from it, how all workers are harmed
by it, why they should fight it, and how to fight it effectively. The
basic cause is the profit system, and the beneficiaries are the
capitalists who do everything they can to keep the workers divided
along any lines possible — racial, geographic, religious, sexual, etc.
Because the more the workers are divided, the easier it is for the
employers to exploit them and squeeze the maximum profit out of their
labor. The workers have to be shown that Jim Crow benefits the ruling
class, and that anything that perpetuates Jim Crow is harmful to their
own interests. It must be made plain that Jim Crow is not the product
of Stalin. This is not said in defense of Stalin, but of a historically
incontrovertible fact. Jim Crow is the product of capitalism, American
capitalism; its seat is in Washington, not Moscow. Any propaganda that
obscures this fact is harmful and not helpful to the Negroes and their
white allies.
 
The Roots of Jim Crow
The workers must be encouraged and taught to figure out
their problems from the standpoint of how their problems affect the
class and individual conditions and liberties of the masses themselves.
When the question of a strike comes up, workers should be conditioned
to ask: “Will this strike help me and the other workers, or will it
help the capitalists, who benefit from our losses and lose from our
gains?” They should not be bamboozled into introducing extraneous
questions, like: “Will this strike help Stalin, or hurt him?” Trying to
figure out what is going on in Stalin’s mind (something the masterminds
in Washington have not done with perceptible success) can result only
in confusion, lack of determination, demoralization and inactivity —
which are of benefit only to the capitalists and the white supremacists.
The argument is not altogether new; only the form is. In World War
II it had a slightly different wording, namely, will this or that
action help Hitler? For some groups this became the sole and supreme
criterion for everything. The Communist Party was most guilty of this.
If workers wanted to resist speedup, or if Negroes wanted to march on
Washington to protest Jim Crow, the Stalinists opposed and fought them
on the grounds that such action was disruptive of “national unity” and
therefore helpful to Hitler. The Stalinists became the most vicious and
virulent opponents of labor and Negro struggles because their policy of
considering everything from the viewpoint of how it allegedly affected
Miller led them to shut their eyes to how these things affected the
workers and Negroes, and to subordinate and oppose every progressive
struggle under the guise of fighting Hitler. Those who use this method
in its new form will do the same and will play into the hands of the
reactionary ruling class, which is already stressing the idea that
there must be no more conflicts in this country because Stalin wants us
to be fighting one another instead of him.
 
Who Really Benefits from Terrorism?
But even if it is conceded for the sake of argument that
the murder of Mr. and Mrs. Moore is a service for Stalin (in the sense
that he makes use of it, not that he committed it) — so what? Is that
all it is? On the contrary, it is also a service for the American
ruling class — in fact, a much bigger service for them than for him.
The purpose of Jim Crow terrorism, as we noted earlier, is to keep the
Negro “in his place.” That is where American capitalism has tried to
keep him since 1876 when they made a deal with the Southern landlords,
businessmen and Ku Kluxers at the expense of the Bill of Rights and the
Negro people, and that is where they are trying to keep him today.
Stalin may reap certain indirect propaganda benefits from Jim Crow
terrorism, but American capitalism benefits from it directly,
politically and economically, and in a big way. That is why they do
nothing to stop it.
The Moore murders embarrass them in the United Nations. But not
enough so that they want to end Jim Crow at home. For them it is
cheaper to pay the price of being embarrassed than of having anything
done to overthrow the Jim Crow system. So Walter White is telling only
half the truth. The murder of Harry T. Moore is a service for Truman as
well as for Stalin.
White, Murray and Reuther make a great deal of noise about how
embarrassing Jim Crow is to American capitalism. The Truman
administration, which would not be in power without the support of the
South, knows all about this embarrassment, even better than its labor
and Negro supporters. But that does not stop them from maintaining the
Jim Crow system. Why this is so, why the ruling class retains the
“embarrassment” of Jim Crow and desperately resists all efforts to end
it — that is the question which White, Murray and Reuther never even
think of asking. But it is the decisive question and must be answered.
 
Why Washington Prefers “Embarrassment”
Abolishing Jim Crow is no easy thing. Even if they
decided in Washington to do it, it would still not be easy. Because the
ruling class in the South would not like the idea. That is putting it
very mildly. They know that Truman’s only interest is in getting Negro
votes and not in threatening the South’s sacred way of life, but they
go wild with rage every time he utters a few innocuous words about poll
taxes or FEPC. And if the government actually tried to end Jim Crow in
the South, we would be confronted with the threat of another civil war.
In other words, the only way to abolish Jim Crow in this country is
by making a revolution in the South, which is the powerhouse and
breeding ground of the Jim Crow system. The present Southern ruling
class would have to be thrown out of power, and that would be a
revolution, a political revolution. But no matter how started, such a
political revolution would inevitably tend to develop into a social and
economic overturn, which in turn would upset the whole national
structure. And that is why the capitalists who are running things will
never consent to the abolition of the Jim Crow system. And nothing will
shake them in this. They would much rather risk alienating the whole
world than risk a revolution threatening their own profits and
privileges at home.
The final note in the White-Murray propaganda is a plea to the
ruling class to end their great “inconsistency.”
How, they ask, can you get ready to fight a war for democracy in
Europe and Asia and continue to treat the Negro at home in the most
undemocratic fashion? Can’t you see that to be consistent you must give
the Negro democracy in America too?
But since the capitalists know that they are not preparing for a war
for democracy in any respect, this alleged inconsistency does not
bother them at all. Their foreign policy and their domestic policy,
despite what the labor and Negro leaders say, are cut from the same
cloth. They are not getting ready to bring the blessings of democracy
to the people of Asia or Europe any more than they are getting ready to
extend them to American Negroes. On the contrary, they intend to
enslave the people both at home and abroad, and are proceeding to
destroy civil liberties at home precisely so that nobody here will be
able to interfere with their reactionary program abroad.
 
Where There Is a Contradiction
Walter White and Philip Murray regard the war in Korea
as a crusade for democracy, but millions of American Negroes, when they
heard Truman give the order for US intervention, which he called a
“police action,” must have thought to themselves: “I sure feel sorry
for the Koreans if they get the same kind of ‘police action’ we’ve been
getting.” And they do — the police action against colonial masses in
Korea is qualitatively the same thing as police action against
minorities here at home, although on a bigger scale and with bigger
weapons.
So there is a great contradiction, but it is with the labor and
liberal leaders who act as apologists for the imperialists. They have
got to make a choice themselves. If they keep on supporting capitalism
and its foreign policy and its wars then they will have to subordinate
labor and Negro struggles, shove them into the background the way the
Stalinists did in World War II (and as the liberals are already
half-doing by their timorous policy on the Moore case). Or else they
will have to increase their opposition to Jim Crow, the wage freeze,
high prices, big profits and the witch hunt, and break with the
imperialist foreign policy that conflicts with every progressive
movement and struggle in the world today.
That is their problem, and they will have to meet it. Revolutionary
socialists have made their choice, and nothing will swerve them from
it. They are and will remain implacable opponents of capitalism and its
Jim Crow, and nothing will persuade them to moderate or abandon that
struggle for a single day, rain or shine, war or peace, Murray or
White, Truman, Taft or Eisenhower. Because they understand that if the
struggle is stopped, if the fight is weakened, then things will become
even worse than they are now.
 
An Instructive Lesson from Jewish History
Nothing could be more deadly for the Negro people than a
fatalistic belief in progress — automatic, self-moving progress, the
chief staple of liberalism and reformism. This is borne out by what
happened to the Jews. Before the first world war, when he was still a
Marxist, Karl Kautsky wrote a book which was revised after the war and
translated into English under the title, Are the Jews A Race?

This book is still worth reading as an example of the conceptions of
the socialist movement about the Jewish question at that time. It
contains some historical and anthropological material, an analysis of
economic causes of anti-Semitism, etc. But its most interesting chapter
is the one on the assimilation of the Jews, containing a number of
tables of statistics showing that gradually the Jews were intermingling
more and more with Christians and intermarrying with them at a really
remarkable rate — in some European countries during the early part of
the century, one out of every three or four Jews was marrying non-Jews
and great numbers of them were being converted to Christianity.
All in all, there seemed good ground to accept the prevailing
belief, shared even by the socialists, that the Jewish question was
solving itself through the assimilation of the Jews. An appealing
notion — but how appallingly false! It proves that history, and
especially the history of oppressed groups, does not move forward in a
straight line but that it zigs and zags, that conditions can arise
which will wipe out in a single decade all the gains that have been
painfully accumulated in a century of strenuous effort. How empty and
remote the statistics in Kautsky’s book appear alongside of the single,
lone statistic we became acquainted with after World War II — six
million Jews exterminated under Hitler in a few brief years.
And so the Negro people must be warned: Remember what happened to
the Jews. They too were told in assuring tones about how things were
getting better day by day and all they had to do was wait and be
patient with the “gradual” method and then the happy day of equality
would dawn by itself. Remember what happened to the Jews in Europe and
do not let anybody lull you with consoling statistics! The day may come
in this country too when the ruling class, determined to conquer the
whole world, will try to drown the Negro people in blood as an example
and scapegoat for the other victims of capitalism.
 
A Century of Experience in Negro Struggle
The idea that the Negro question would solve itself, so
to speak, seemed to have validity once upon a time. This capitalist
system we live under was progressive in its youth. Less than a hundred
years ago the capitalists united, although reluctantly at first, with
Negroes and workers and farmers to wage a bloody civil war that ended
in the smashing of the chattel slave system. There was reason then to
think that under capitalism Negroes could eventually prosper or at
least breathe the free air of equality. Then, after the Civil War, came
the period of Reconstruction, whose first stages were the brightest
chapter in the book of American history, when the capitalist government
did not hesitate to suppress the former slaveholders and to keep them
suppressed and to use federal troops and guns in support of the
Negroes’ struggle for freedom.
But that was when capitalism was young and thriving and moving
ahead. Today this profit system is old and decrepit, attacked by
incurable diseases, demented by illusions of grandeur and vain hopes
that it can succeed in the program of world conquest that Hitler failed
to achieve. It’s a different animal now. Since the betrayal of
Reconstruction, which gave the reins of power in the South back to the
former slaveowners, there has been no reason whatever to expect
anything progressive from the capitalists Besides, why should the Negro
people expect that their capitalist oppressors are going to grant them
more rights at a time when the capitalists are busily engaged in
withdrawing rights from the white workers, staging a witch hunt to
destroy freedom of speech and press and association for the white
workers? Preparations for an imperialist world war do not portend the
flowering of democracy for the Negro people — they signify an attempt
[illegible in original] way, to wipe out the democratic rights of all
the masses. Even without the evidence of new and spreading forms of
lynching and terrorism, it does not take much vision to see that the
prospects for things getting better by themselves are very slim, and
are going to get slimmer unless they are resisted vigorously,
militantly, in the spirit of Harry T. Moore.
 
Moore Pointed to the Road
The solution is not easy, and anyone who thinks it is,
is fooling himself. These are not easy times in which to make progress.
Many people who know that the answer lies in struggle have been
frightened by the witch hunt and have retired to the sidelines. But
struggle is still the only answer, and no slick or cheap substitutes
will do. Sending petitions to Truman will not bear any better results
now than in the past. Proposals for a boycott of Florida citrus fruits
and vacation centers are not harmful as such — unless the idea is
created that they are the answer. By themselves they do no harm, but
they cannot do much good either. Struggle, backed up by the readiness
to sacrifice that Harry T. Moore exhibited, remains the only answer.
The nature of the struggle is primarily political. If the government
wants to, it can put an end to terrorism in the South, which is itself
a political thing. Because the government does not really want to, the
government must be changed. Not changed by shifting from control by one
capitalist party to control by another capitalist party, but changed
from a government representing the interests of the capitalist class to
one representing the interests of the workers, Negroes, working
farmers, housewives and youth — representing them, controlled by them,
responsible to them and replaceable by them. If the government wants
to, it can end discrimination in industry. Because it does not want to,
it must be changed. And so it goes with all the other problems facing
the labor and Negro movements — they are political problems, which can
be solved only through political action and struggle.
We revolutionary socialists are hot able by ourselves alone to set
into motion our program for combatting terrorism. That is because we
are still a small minority. But even a small minority, armed with a
correct program, can exert a tremendous influence. The Abolitionists
also started out small, a persecuted minority whose leaders were tarred
and feathered and jailed and lynched, but within a few decades they
ended up by seeing two-thirds of the nation take up arms to defend the
anti-slavery principles they had stuck to so persistently during dark
and troubled times.
 
Future Belongs to Revolutionary Socialism
And revolutionary socialism will not remain a minority;
because our ideas conform to reality and are right, they will attract
the majority of the people, and they will triumph. Some have been
scared off by the witch hunt, and others have been corrupted into
compliance and apathy by “prosperity” — but the ruling class cannot
stop ideas or their spread because it cannot do away with the
reactionary conditions of life that produce those ideas and it cannot
prevent the rise of new generations [illegible in original] whom the
future rests and who will not want the future to be like the past. Our
confidence in the future is not the result of wishful thinking or of an
ability to hop ourselves up, but the product of scientific study and
understanding of society and history and the class struggle.
Some people think that it is visionary, hopelessly impractical and
idealistic to continue a struggle to end capitalism against, such
seemingly great odds. The same view was held by most people 100 years
ago when a minority suggested that it was advisable, necessary and
possible to end the system of slavery. “The slave system is here to
stay,” they were told, “and only crazy fanatics will refuse to try to
live with it, and maybe fix it up, patch it or reform it here or
there.” But from their own experience with the slave system, the
majority of the American people were forced to the conclusion that
slavery had to go, and they had to accept the program of the
revolutionists whom they had derided as crackpots.
Experience with capitalism, especially with capitalism in its death
agony, is going to have the same consequences in our own time. It is
going to teach the people that if they want to live, capitalism must
die, and that if they want peace and dignity they will first have to
employ militancy in taking power away from the capitalists. It is not
the revolutionary socialists, primarily, who will teach these things,
but capitalism itself. The Harlem paper, the New York Age,
says:
“The blast (that blew up Harry T. Moore’s home)
exploded all hopes that the fight for equality in politics, education,
the courts and other spheres of life in the South could be won with
little or no bloodshed.”
We have said that too, but events say it better. We’re
educating all whom we can reach to the best of our ability — but
capitalism is educating them too and in a way that will have deeper,
more lasting, profound and revolutionary effects than any words we can
speak or write.
The enemies of Jim Crow, war and thought control are still on the
defensive. But that is no reason for despair. The Nation
is correct when it observes that the Moore bombing “is likely to bring
about an imponderable change in the political thinking of American
Negroes” and when it notes that pressure for militant action is coming
from “rank-and-file Negroes whose patience is utterly exhausted not
only with Dixiecrat provocation but with the relaxed middle-class
attitude of some of their leaders, who have been quite willing to issue
further political bills of credit to Mr. Truman on the basis of his
stale civil rights speeches of 1948 and the lesser evil premise.” A
similar process is certain to develop among the white workers. Whether
it likes it or not, capitalism is forced to continue to produce all
kinds of opportunities for awakening the masses and driving them into
struggle against conditions as they are. If the politically advanced
workers know how to stick to their guns and grab hold of all the
opportunities offered them, then they will win to their side all the
other workers whose needs are satisfied by the program of revolutionary
socialism, and then it will be goodbye forever to capitalism, and all
of its products like Jim Crow terrorism.



There are plenty of vital statistics and useful facts about the oppression of the Negro people in the document [1] presented to the United Nations last October by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
This document can be of considerable value to those first becoming acquainted with the American Negro question, but it does not take us very far toward solution of that problem. Strong on the presentation of facts, it is weak on explaining and analyzing those facts, and almost worthless when it comes to a consideration of what should be done about them.
These facts constitute a damning indictment of American “democracy.” They show that the Negro people,
“... something less than a tenth of the nation ... form largely a segregated caste, with restricted legal rights, and many illegal disabilities ... [They have] a strong, hereditary cultural unity, born of slavery, of common suffering, prolonged proscription and curtailment of political and civil rights; and especially because of economic and social disabilities ...”
But why? Nowhere in this document is there a clear answer to this all-important question.
DuBois comes closest to discussing it in the following widely separated remarks, buried away in the midst of discussion of other issues. Slavery, he notes,
“... was a matter of economics, a question of income and labor, rather than a problem of right and wrong, or of the physical differences in men. Once slavery began to be the source of vast income for men and nations, there followed frantic search for moral and racial justifications.”
After the Reconstruction Era, he declares, Northern industry joined with the Southern landowners “to disfranchise the Negro; keep him from access to free land or to capital, and to build up the present caste system for blacks founded on color discrimination, peonage, intimidation and mob-violence.” The US as a result is “ruled by wealth, monopoly and big business organization to an astounding degree.” And in the South today, DuBois adds in passing, “Industry encourages the culture patterns which make these groups [competing for jobs] hate and fear each other.”
Added together, these statements provide at least a clue to the answer. Why then aren’t they added together and summed up in a forthright declaration on the causes of Jim Crow oppression? Because DuBois and the NAACP leaders and most of the prominent Negro leaders are afraid of the conclusions that would have to be drawn from a consistent analysis of these causes. We have no such fears, however, and neither do the Negro masses. Let us therefore say plainly what DuBois only hints at:
Like slavery, Jim Crow oppression is rooted in economic life. It is profitable to the capitalist ruling class in both the North and the South, and that’s why they not only encourage, but instigate and maintain this system and bitterly resist any attempt to end it.
Furthermore, Jim Crow is a matter of politics. DuBois gives irrefutable proof of this in demonstrating that the dis-franchisement of the Negroes in the South “means greater power for the few who cast the vote.” His analysis of the 1946 elections shows, for example, that the Southern landowner who disfranchises Negro and white workers and sharecroppers has a power at the polls greater than that of six workers and farmers in the North. This explains not only why the South is the most backward section of the country but also why the Southern congressmen elected by this political monopoly form the most reactionary bloc in Washington where the laws for the whole nation are written.



Facts About Jim Crow
(As Compiled by Leslie S. Perry for the NAACP’s Appeal to the UN)



But here too the NAACP document fails to draw the necessary conclusions. True, it cites the obvious need for abolishing Negro disfranchisement. But that is too narrow and limited an answer for the many political problems arising out of Negro oppression, and fails to even touch the crucial point: What measures are necessary to achieve the goal of Negro equality at the polls — itself a political goal? We are again compelled to say explicitly what the NAACP document only half-implies:
Jim Crow is not only a source of political power for the ruling class, but the political power of the ruling class is itself a source of Jim Crow. This inevitably raises the question of the government — the executive committee of the ruling class through which its political power is exercised.
Consequently, the only effective way to fight Jim Crow is by fighting the capitalist system, and the only way to end it for good is by political action to replace the capitalist system with one under which Jim Crow won’t be profitable — that is, a socialist system.
By rejecting or evading this approach, whose basis is no confidence whatever in the capitalist class or any of its agencies, the Negro leaders are trapped in one contradiction after another, thus weakening and undermining the Negro struggles. A few examples from the NAACP document will illustrate this.
When the ruling classes of the North and South worked out their “gentleman’s agreement” in 1876 and set out to deprive the Negro of the civil rights he had won during the Civil War and Reconstruction, the Supreme Court was one of the chief instruments employed. The Court obligingly ruled that most of the Congressional civil rights statutes were illegal, and that the states rather than the federal government had the responsibility of guaranteeing civil rights. As a result, it is precisely in those places where the Negro most needs legal protection that he gets it least — in the South, where the state governments, far from adopting civil rights laws, legally established the pattern of segregation which is the base of the modern Jim Crow system.
Dickerson does a great deal of historical and legal research on the period leading up to 1914 to disprove what he calls “the fallacy inherent in the argument that the legal rights of American Negroes can be entrusted to the states.” Now a fallacy is a mistaken assumption, an erroneous conclusion or argument, etc. But there was nothing at all “fallacious” about the thinking of the US ruling class when it decided to “entrust” the Negro’s legal rights to the states! On the contrary, it was a carefully thought-out device for achieving exactly what was intended — the legal destruction of the Negro’s rights. Only people who are themselves suffering from the most pernicious fallacies about the nature of the ruling class or its Supreme Court could use such a namby-pamby term to describe a diabolically successful conspiracy against the Negro people.
But the authors of the NAACP document do hot even carry through consistently their own line of reasoning. They refrain from a similar criticism of the idea that the legal rights of the Negroes can be safely entrusted to the federal government and its agencies — a conception spread far and wide by most of the Negro leaders. Is that any less a “fallacy” than the one concerning reliance on the state governments? Not at all. Remember, first of all, that the federal government connived to make “state’s rights” dominant in this field. And now it follows a pattern in its treatment of Negroes (armed forces, government employees, District of Columbia) which essentially duplicates that followed by the Southern states. The “big” difference between the two is that the federal government is the executive committee of the national ruling class while the state governments perform the same repressive role for the local sections of that ruling class.
In another place, Dickerson says that
“... to tell a Negro who has suffered from mob violence because of state inaction that he must look to the state for protection sounds very much like telling a woman who has been seduced that her future protection lies in the hands of the seducer.”
This is apt and well put, although the crime committed in the case of the Negro is more like rape than seduction. But in that case, telling the Negro to rely on the federal government is like telling the woman to rely on the man who delivered her to the attacker and even held her while the crime was committed. Yet, because of their false theories on the main cause of Jim Crow and on the nature of the capitalist state, that has been the essence of the Negro leaders’ program and demands.
By the above we do not at all wish to belittle or criticize demands for federal legislation against lynching, the poll tax, discriminatory employment practices, and so on. Such demands are obviously necessary and progressive because they facilitate the mobilization of the masses against the Jim Crow system and because their realization would considerably weaken and undermine the Jim Crow status quo. What we are criticizing and warning against here is the impression spread by Negro leaders that such limited demands are the be-all and end-all of the Negro struggle and that their realization would solve the problems of the Negro people. Such a conception is false to the core for it ignores the real roots of Jim Crow — the capitalist system.
Now this very same fallacy appears, even in a more extended form, in the NAACP appeal to the UN for redress. Having obtained no satisfaction from petitions to the stales, then having made little headway as a result of petitions to the federal government, the NAACP leaders feel that it is
“... fitting and proper that the thirteen million American citizens of Negro descent should appeal to the United Nations and ask that organization in the proper way to take cognizance of a situation that deprives this group of their rights as men and citizens.”
It is, of course, perfectly proper for the Negro people to utilize the UN as a forum in which to present their grievances. Skillfully utilized, such a procedure can serve to expose the fraudulence of the US government’s pretensions about democracy at home and abroad. (The NAACP document, incidentally fails to take proper advantage of this opportunity by bewailing the fact that American prestige is lowered and embarrassed by its oppression of Negroes at home. While this may be important to the American ruling class, which wants to extend its power and domination all over the globe, it is certainly not embarrassing to the Negro masses, and it is certainly not the reason why they want Negro oppression ended.) But what can practically come out of such an appeal to the UN, except some publicity and an advance in the education of the people about the indifference of the UN to genuine democracy and its subservience to Wall Street?
The NAACP leaders do not say anything on the question one way or the other, and perhaps they privately don’t expect much to come of it. But in the absence of any statement to the contrary, their appeal creates illusions among the masses about (1) the nature of the UN and (2) the correct way to fight Jim Crow. Instead of strengthening, it tends to weaken that fight by creating the wrong impression that there is some other way to win equality than by mass struggle against capitalism and its agencies.
Such an appeal, while useful as propaganda, is manifestly worthless as a means of improving conditions in this country because the American imperialist oppressors of the Negro, who dominate the UN, just will not permit it to “intervene.” And even if the US ruling class did not dominate the UN, it wouldn’t make any difference because this association of bandits has no desire or intention to halt oppression anywhere. This has already been amply demonstrated by its attitude toward the colored peoples of Indonesia, Indo-China and South Africa. For the Negro masses to entertain any illusions on this score would be like a Negro slave complaining about the cruelty of his master to the Confederate Government during the Civil War and expecting it to give him redress.
 
The Nationalist Element
There are many things that the NAACP leaders see but do not understand. One of the most important is the national element in the Negro struggle. DuBois notes the fact that all Negroes are discriminated against, those with “wealth, training and character” as well as those without. He declared:
“... prolonged policies of segregation and discrimination have involuntarily welded the [Negro] mass almost into a nation within a nation with its own schools, churches, hospitals, newspapers and many business enterprises.”
The results of this growing national (or racial) consciousness, he finds, have been both good and bad. Good in that it inspired the Negroes to “frantic and often successful effort to achieve, to deserve, to show the world their capacity to share modern civilization.” And bad in that it has made the Negroes to a wide extent “provincial, introvertive, self-conscious and narrowly race-loyal.” Coming from the pen of a white liberal or social worker, such an estimate might not seem out of place. But from a Negro leader who has made genuine contributions to the study of Negro history, it is certainly inadequate and negative, especially from the viewpoint of what effects national movements have on the struggle for Negro liberation. Let us consider the Marxist estimate:
The national consciousness of the Negro people, induced by the factors cited by DuBois, does indeed have varying effects. Such attitudes as Negro nationalism, black chauvinism, etc., do carry a danger of being utilized to spread mistrust of all whites, including the whites who are opposed to Jim Crow, and to widen the divisions between Negroes and their natural ally, the labor movement. But essentially this national consciousness is an expression of the Negro’s desire for equality and is therefore progressive (unlike white chauvinism which reflects the desire for continued racial supremacy). J.R. Johnson has correctly called attention to an important consideration in this connection:
“Whereas in Europe the national movements have usually aimed at a separation from the oppressing power, in the US the race consciousness and chauvinism of the Negro represent fundamentally a consolidation of his forces for the purpose of integration into American society.”
That is one side of it, and not all of that is bad by a long shot. On the other side are the power and explosiveness lodged in national movements, which organize the oppressed minorities in struggles whose objective consequence can only be the abolition of capitalism. The American Negro as a minority cannot solve his problems without powerful allies, but even by himself he can direct heavy blows at the system, keep it in a state of instability by his opposition and help set into motion other revolutionary forces which can and will collaborate in the solution of his particular problems because they share the same fundamental interests. DuBois seems oblivious of the dynamite lodged in the Negro’s national consciousness; for him it presents only a “dilemma.” But for those who aim at destroying Jim Crow the racial feelings and nationalist movements of the Negro people present a challenge and an opportunity. Here is a powerful anti-capitalist and anti-Jim Crow force if they know how to direct it into correct channels.
It is one-sided and therefore wrong to stop with the national aspects; the Negro question involves much more than that. It combines the struggle of an oppressed minority for democracy with the struggle of the entire working class for emancipation from capitalism. This second factor is never explicitly stated or recognized in the document, although it contains the figures to prove it.
 
A Class Question
Perry cites the following statistics from the 1940 census:
The total number of Negroes gainfully employed in the United States amounted to 4,479,068 men and women (not counting those on public emergency work). Of these, the vast majority, 61%, were unskilled workers. Less than 3% were “skilled and foremen” and only 2.6 were professional persons. The rest were largely semi-skilled workers, farm tenants and the like.
Thus the Negro question is overwhelmingly a working class question, tied up with the fate of the labor movement as a whole and dependent on the fulfillment of the working class’s destiny as the gravedigger of capitalism and the builder of a new society. To ignore this vital fact is to deprive the Negro of the aid of his best and strongest ally. It is not enough merely to pass annual declarations of solidarity with labor and to invite an occasional union bureaucrat to speak at NAACP meetings or add his name to the NAACP Board of Directors. What is needed above all is for the Negro organizations to strengthen the ties of active collaboration with the labor organizations and to try to influence them in a progressive direction. The Negro people will not win their second emancipation until labor has settled accounts with capital. The Negro people have a great part to play in that settlement.
The assumption guiding these Negro leaders — that the Negro people can attain equality under capitalism, even in its “democratic” form — is not consistent with the facts adduced or implied in the NAACP document. It is the theoretical source of all their mistakes, vacillations and betrayals of the Negro struggle.
The authors can admit flatly, as Dickerson does, that
“... by 1914, the eve of the First World War, the legal status of the American Negro had degenerated to the pattern that existed before the Civil War.”
But do they understand what this statement really means — that at the height of the flowering of democratic capitalism the American ruling class had no more to offer the Negro than in slave days? Do they appreciate what a terrible indictment that is of capitalism in its prime, when it was able to grant some concessions to the masses? Can’t they realize what this means today — and even more for tomorrow — now that the permanent crisis of this decadent system drives the ruling class not to grant new concessions and rights but to withdraw as many of them as they can, as the anti-labor drive now sweeping the country demonstrates?
They can calmly declare, to quote Konvitz, that in addition to “the inequalities that exist despite the law,” there are also many “inequalities that exist because of the law,” These include the right of Negroes “to live where they please, to be free from segregation in schools and universities, to vote without the poll tax restrictions, to ride in intrastate commerce in public conveyances without subjection to Jim Crowism.” In court contests against these inequalities, “the Negro has been unsuccessful, even when, as in recent years, the Supreme Court has consisted of a liberal majority.” Do they actually grasp what they are saying when they admit that so far as the Negro is concerned, the capitalist liberals upon whom they rely for improving the situation, act no better than the other supporters of capitalism?
Or take the conclusion reached by this remark of Ming: “The political and legal system of the United States appears to be unable or unwilling to cope with this hiatus between the theoretical and actual status of the Negro.” But what does it matter whether the capitalist politicians and judges are “unable or unwilling”? Isn’t it plain that a system which either can’t or won’t grant the most elementary democratic rights to the Negroes is rotten to the core and must be replaced by one that can and will?
But while their “theory” is contradicted at every point by the facts, the policy recommended and followed by the Negro leaders is consistent with and flows from their “theory” of refusing to place the responsibility for Jim Crow where it really belongs. Refusing to recognize the core of the problem, they attribute Negro oppression to “fallacies,” “paradoxes,” “enigmas,” “apathy” and even “shortsightedness” of the capitalist class.
True, they put pressure on the capitalist class in order to get recognition and correction of these “fallacies.” But they want to arouse and employ no more than the most limited kind of pressure — the kind that will serve to embarrass and extract a concession or pat on the head from the ruling class, but that will never under any circumstances challenge their power to oppress and exploit and their right to rule. This is shown best of all by the Negro leaders’ approach to politics.
The NAACP program — to end lynching, the poll tax, industrial and military Jim Crow, etc. — is conceived by its leaders as a legislative program. To put it more correctly, it is a political program whose fate will be decided by the political struggle of the masses. As was stated above, the NAACP leaders reject our concept that what is needed is an anti-capitalist political movement aiming to take power away from the Jim Crow capitalist parties and government. What is more, they reject even the concept of organized political action by the Negro masses.
Yes, ludicrous as it may appear and tragic as it is, the largest Negro organization in the world still refuses to use political weapons in a political war and still relies on lobbying methods that have proved their ineffectiveness over and over again during the NAACP’s 37 year history. This puts the NAACP leaders on an even lower political level than the moss-backed AFL bureaucrats, who finally had it drummed into their fat heads by the Taft-Hartley Act that no fight against the employers can be divorced from politics. How many more blows will the NAACP leaders need before they are forced to a like conclusion?
The alibi offered by the NAACP leaders for the abstentionist policy is as pathetic as the policy itself. The NAACP, they say, is a “non-partisan” organization that cannot take sides in politics without offending and alienating its members, friendly politicians and wealthy well-wishers, who have diverse political views. The best it can do is urge its members to register and vote, to inform them of the voting records of the various candidates — and then hope for the best! They do not explain what value to the organization are members and sympathizers who want to be “non-partisan” as between the political foes and the political friends of the Negro people. Nor has it apparently occurred to them that the loss of such followers would be compensated many fold by the recruiting of Negro workers when they saw that the NAACP really meant business about fighting their enemies, including those in high political seats.
Abstentionism from politics is, however, also a kind of politics — the worst kind because it damages above all those who practice it. The NAACP’s “neutrality” is most pleasing to the political practitioners of Jim Crow because it leaves undisturbed the political monoply by which they sustain the Jim Crow system. How the reactionary politicians whose election was left unopposed by the NAACP must laugh when the NAACP comes around lobbying for something like an anti-lynch law! They probably even smiled when the politically self-disarmed NAACP presented its document to the UN, where the politically “safe” appointees of the US capitalist government will see that it comes to naught.
In the middle Thirties, there was a strong movement among the workers in the factories toward the AFL as the only important national labor organization in the field. But these workers were looking for something different and better than the AFL, as was soon shown in the industrial explosion out of which the CIO was born as the labor movement on a higher level — industrial unionism. In the same Way during recent years there has been a strong tide among the Negro masses toward the NAACP as the only important national Negro organization in the field.
This tide has swept into the NAACP tens of thousands of militant young Negroes eager to deal a finish blow to the Jim Crow system. Explosions lie ahead here too. They will either transform the NAACP’s character in accordance with the needs of the times or else replace it with a new organization that can play the role required. It behooves these Negro militants to study the origins as well as the effects of the Jim Crow system and to take measures to prepare themselves and their present organization for the most useful ways to conduct the Negro struggle.
 
New Leaders Needed
What is needed now is a new Negro leadership — one that is not afraid to draw radical conclusions and advocate drastic measures when they are justified by the facts. Fighters who will not have any illusions about the hostile character of capitalism and all its agencies and servants, no matter how disguised; who will recognize and strengthen the bonds linking the Negro struggle for equality with the organized labor movement and who stand ready, if that becomes necessary, to mobilize their people for action on their own behalf without waiting for labor to act first. This new leadership will understand the progressive character of Negro national consciousness and will know how to utilize its power in the right direction; it will rearm the Negro movement politically through an independent labor-Negro coalition.
Jim Crow is twined inextricably around the trunk of capitalism like a poisonous vine around a tree; both are nourished by the same soil of class society. It is necessary to cut down this tree at its roots in order to kill the vine, just as it was necessary to abolish slavery root and branch. The more hands that are put on the job, the sooner it will be done. The axe is waiting to be used by that new Negro leadership which is already arising from the ranks and is destined to replace the present half-way leaders who dare neither to think things through to the end — nor to act decisively to destroy Jim Crow.

Burghardt Du Bois, historian and director of the NAACP Department of Special Research, with contributions by attorney Earl B. Dickerson of Chicago, Milton R. Konvitz of Cornell University, William R. Ming, Jr., of the University of Chicago, Leslie S. Perry of the NAACP Washington Bureau, and Rayford W. Logan of Howard University).



Up to now the capitalist masters of this country have been able to control or contain the efforts of black people to liberate themselves. Directly and indirectly, they have set down the rules and the boundaries within which the Negro organizations have operated. As a result, the leaders of those organizations have usually been “the right kind” — moderates and liberals, who know what they may and may not do, who abide by the rules and do not cross the boundaries. The main reason why black Americans are not closer to their goal of freedom, justice and equality is that they have lacked a mass movement and a leadership truly independent of the ruling class, its ideology and its institutions.
Malcolm X set out early in 1964 to build such a movement, but he was killed before he could do more than expound some basic principles and offer a personal example of fearless independence. The Black Power tendency is an attempt, starting from a slightly different direction, to do essentially the same thing that Malcolm tried to do. Its appearance marks another stage in the radicalization of the Negro people, in accord with the law that the more independent any oppressed group is of the ruling class, the more radical it tends to be.
Organizationally, the Black Power tendency is only in the early stages of its development; the various groups and individuals who have raised the Black Power banner have not yet defined their relations to each other or united into a single movement or federation. But numerically it is already considerably stronger than the organized adherents of Malcolm’s movement. The Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), groups in the new tendency, are national organizations, with thousands of members or sympathizers. They have an experienced cadre of dedicated leaders and activists, hardened in battle along many fronts and equipped with a variety of skills. They represent the best of the new generation of young freedom fighters who appeared on the scene around 1960, with a consistently more militant outlook than that of previous generations and an enviable ability to learn from experience and grow.
Ideologically and politically, the Black Power tendency is also still in the process of crystallization. But its direction-to the left-is unmistakably indicated by the way it has broken away from several of the premises and shibboleths of the old “civil rights” consensus. Internationalist and anti-imperialist, it expresses solidarity with the worldwide struggle against colonialism and neo-colonialism, condemns the US war in Vietnam and rejects the contention that the freedom movement “should not mix civil rights and foreign policy.” It spurns the straitjacket of “non-violence” and proclaims the right of self-defense. It challenges the fraudulent claim that freedom can be won through the passage of a series of civil-rights laws that are largely un-enforced and benefit mainly middle-class Negroes.
Some of its adherents still believe in working inside the Democratic Party, but others advocate a complete break with the Democrats and Republicans and the establishment of independent black or black-led parties — not only in Lowndes County, Ala., but in the Northern ghettos. Some accept capitalism; others are talking rather vaguely about a cooperative based economy for the black community that they think would be neither capitalist nor socialist; and there is also evidently a pro-socialist grouping, as was shown when delegates at a Black Power planning conference in Washington Sept. 3 posed the need to “determine which is more politically feasible for the advancement of black power, capitalism or socialism.”
It was therefore to be expected, and logical, that Johnson, Humphrey and the capitalist brainwashers would oppose and attack Black Power, and not surprising that most liberals tagged along behind them. But how account for the attitudes of the Socialist and Communist parties and the forces close to them? Why do they respond with distress, fear or hostility, to the development of a radical and potentially pro-socialist movement among the Negro people?
 
Radical Critics of Black Power
Bayard Rustin, social-democrat and director of the A. Philip Randolph Institute, is one of the harshest critics of Black Power. Writing in the September issue of Commentary, he says that it “not only lacks any real value for the civil rights movement, but that its propagation is positively harmful. It diverts the movement from a meaningful debate over strategy and tactics, it isolates the Negro community, and it encourages the growth of anti-Negro forces.” SNCC and CORE once “awakened the country, but now they emerge isolated and demoralized, shouting a slogan that may afford a momentary satisfaction but that is calculated to destroy them and their movement.”
Paul Feldman, a member of the Socialist Party’s national executive committee and editor of its paper, New America, is equally antagonistic. In the June 30 issue of his paper and in the September-October issue of Dissent, he says that Black Power “as it is practiced by SNCC means only the continuation of protest outside the political framework.” “Slogans like ‘black power’ are substitutes for some painful rethinking; they are an attempt to stir a lagging movement by injecting heady verbal stimulants.” In the same way that the social-democrats in the McCarthy era used to criticize Truman and Eisenhower for “encouraging communism,” Feldman charges that:
“Through the inadequacy of its approach to poverty and unemployment, the Johnson administration has encouraged nationalistic tendencies in both the civil rights movement and the Negro community.”
James E. Jackson, a leading Communist Party spokesman, is more circumspect than Rustin and Feldman. That is because he burned his fingers last June at the CP’s national convention when he criticized Black Power; among the younger members of the CP and among the DuBois Clubs there is sympathy for Black Power, and even some sentiment for black nationalism, and they voiced strong objection to Jackson’s remarks. As a result, Jackson’s article in the September issue of Political Affairs finds some favorable things to say about the Black Power tendency, and he couches his opposition to its essential characteristics in softer language than the kind he used to use about Malcolm X and Robert F. Williams. But this does not alter the CP’s basic position, which remains, like that of the SP’s, opposed to the most radical aspects and implications of Black Power.
In their efforts to belittle the Black Power tendency, Rustin and Feldman occasionally go to ridiculous lengths. “In some quarters,” Rustin says, Black Power connotes “a repudiation of non-violence in favor of Negro ‘self-defense.’ Actually this is a false issue, since no one has ever argued that Negroes should not defend themselves as individuals from attack.” No one! Ever! Rustin must think his readers have short memories or have never heard his ally, Martin Luther King, admonishing black people that if blood must flow, it should be theirs. In an attempt to support his claim, Rustin adds a footnote recalling that “as far back as 1934” (he means 1943) he, A. Philip Randolph and others “had joined a committee to try to save the life of Odell Waller ... a sharecropper [who] had murdered his white boss in self-defense.” But that doesn’t prove anything; it is perfectly possible to defend someone on trial for self-defense while opposing self-defense, just as it is possible to defend a terrorist on trial for his life while remaining opposed to terrorism.
Anyway, Rustin completes the circle and compounds the confusion by adding the charge that “the new militant leadership, by raising the slogan of black power and lowering the banner of non-violence, has obscured the moral issue facing this nation [?], and permitted the President and Vice President to lecture us about ‘racism in reverse’ instead of proposing more meaningful programs for dealing with the problems of unemployment, housing and education.” Of course this doesn’t explain what kept Johnson and Humphrey from proposing “more meaningful programs” before the Black Power tendency “permitted” them not to. But it does show that “someone” is still arguing against self-defense. Feldman does not discuss self-defense at all. Jackson endorses the concept, but seems a little uneasy at the suggestion, by “some speakers,” that “Negroes could organize their own policing system to counter the violence of the racists and the police.” He deems it necessary to remind Negroes that they must continue to demand that “the government ... discharge its duty to safeguard the lives and property of all its citizens.”
Feldman doesn’t concede that the Black Power tendency is militant, let alone radical. [1] “The militant verbiage that frightens so many whites may well hide conservative tendencies,” he says. This may explain why he never mentions the SNCC-CORE opposition to the Vietnam war, which is certainly couched in militant and radical terms, and is one of the main reasons for the conservative-liberal attack on Black Power. This is an odd omission for the editor of a paper that is in its own way critical of the war. Odder yet is Rustin’s sole reference to the Black Power position against the war:
“Floyd McKissick and Stokely Carmichael may accuse Roy Wilkins of being out of touch with the Negro ghetto, but nothing more completely demonstrates their own alienation from ghetto youth than their repeated exhortations to these young men to oppose the Vietnam war when so many of them tragically see it as their only way out.”
Such contortions — by a man who still calls himself a pacifist — are all the more notable because this is the first time that a significant section of the organized freedom movement has flatly opposed a major war of the American ruling class. It may be news to Rustin, but the Black Power stand against the war is one of the major sources of its popularity in the ghetto, among both young and old. This is something that Jackson has the sense to recognize, despite his trepidation on other points.
If, in the political arena, the Black Power tendency was concerned only with electing black representatives to public office, our three critics would have no objections. Jackson approves the objective of winning “the political power in those areas where Negroes predominate,” and says the CP has long advocated this. Rustin sees “nothing wrong” (and “nothing inherently radical”) in “the effort to elect Negroes to office in proportion to Negro strength within the population,” although he doesn’t think it important because there are only 80 counties and two congressional districts in the South where Negroes are a majority. Feldman says its all right too, but adds that no special strategy is needed in Southern areas where Negroes are a majority because they would win office anyway “more or less naturally as more and more Negroes in the Black Belt got the vote.”
 
Independent Political Action
But their reaction is quite different when certain advocates of Black Power call for the election of black representatives through independent political action, through the creation of political parties independent of the Democratic Party-such as the Lowndes County Freedom Organization (“Black Panther”) in Alabama. Then the fur begins to fly.
Rustin rejects independent black political action (“SNCC’s Black Panther perspective”) as “simultaneously Utopian and reactionary” – Utopian, because “one-tenth of the population cannot accomplish much by itself”; reactionary, because “such a party would remove Negroes from the main area of political struggle in this country (particularly in the one-party South, where the decisive battles are fought out in Democratic primaries), and would give priority to the issue of race precisely at a time when the fundamental questions facing the Negro and American society alike are economic and social.” Rustin says that “Southern Negroes, despite exhortations from SNCC to organize themselves into a Black Panther party, are going to stay in the Democratic party ... and they are right to stay,” because their winning the right to vote “insures the eventual transformation of the Democratic party, now controlled primarily by Northern machine politicians and Southern Dixiecrats.” The Black Power perspective, he declares, flows from despair, frustration, pessimism and “the belief that the ghetto will last forever.” The best alternative that he can see is “a liberal-labor-civil rights coalition which would work to make the Democratic party truly responsive to the aspirations of the poor.”
Feldman’s arguments are similar. Since Negroes are a minority, they can at best be “a swing vote under certain conditions.” The Black Panther strategy will deprive them of the ability “to affect the choice between a Wallace and a Richmond Flowers.” SNCC’s “most positive quality” has been “prodding liberal elements into action” and that will be dissipated if it breaks from the Democratic Party coalition. “The quick demise of the all-Negro ‘Freedom Now’ Party started in 1963 does not augur well for those who would start a similar political group in the North.” Black Power “continues to bring the racial issue to the forefront when it is vital instead to raise and make central the economic issues that can unite the black and white poor against their exploiters.”
“The real alternative to the coalition strategy for the Negro community is not, as SNCC would have it, a radical movement of the Negro masses but the kind of Negro machines run by Congressmen Powell in New York and Dawson in Chicago, who act as the middle men between machine hacks and power centers in the Democratic Party.”
Black Power “is aimed at the liberal coalition as well as at white racists; and it signifies a rejection of alliance with liberals. It sounds militant, but it marks a retreat into the ghettos of the North and enclaves in the South — a continuation of protest without politics.” And probably worst of all, if SNCC and CORE turn away from a coalition strategy, “the coalition itself faces a major crisis” and may disintegrate.  
Breaking with the Democratic Party
What comes through very distinctly from Rustin and Feldman is the notion that black people are helpless, impotent, unable to do anything significant by themselves, doomed to the auxiliary role of “prodding liberal elements into action.” The social-democrats of course did not originate this view; they absorbed it from the capitalist ideologists — so thoroughly that it is as natural to them now as breathing in and breathing out. Ossified by the dogmas of gradualism and reformism, their minds cannot entertain any part for Negroes to play beyond helping “to affect the choice between a Wallace and a Richmond Flowers” in 1966 (like the choice between Goldwater and Johnson in 1964). Their thinking is so frozen that they equate “political framework” with “Democratic Party,” as though political action outside the Democratic Party, by Negroes or anyone else, is the ultimate absurdity. The revolutionary conception of the American black minority — as a vanguard of social change — is utterly alien to them.
But the most advanced Black Power forces are moving toward this conception, even though their spokesmen do not always formulate it consistently or precisely. Some of them are beginning to grasp the fact that, thanks to discrimination and segregation, which keep them at the bottom of the social structure but also tend to unite them in resistance to their oppression, the Negro people of this country, although they are a minority, are in the uniquely favorable position of being able, through their own efforts (“by themselves”) if necessary, to set into motion a series of changes that can upset the social and political equilibrium and transform the whole future of the United States.
The first step in this process is political — a break by the Negro people with the Democratic Party and the two-party system as a whole, and the formation of a political party of their own. (Whether such a party will be black-led and controlled like the Lowndes County Freedom Organization or all-black, like the Freedom Now Party of 1963–64, is a secondary and tactical question.) This would give them, for the first time, a political instrument that they themselves controlled, through which they could elect their own representatives in both the Southern counties and the Northern cities where they are majorities or the single biggest bloc. For the first time in American history Negroes would have a party that really represented them and that they could count on to contend in their interest against the parties of their oppressors.
And that would be only part of the story. The other part would be the effect their withdrawal would have on the Democratic Party and its coalition with the labor leaders and liberals. In a word, it would be devastating. Without the support it now enjoys from Negroes, the Democratic Party would come apart at the seams; the coalition would be thrust into what Feldman fears so much — “a major crisis.” The Democratic Party would cease to be the major national party. The unions would be forced to reconsider their relations to a party that could no longer win national elections; in the long run, this would strengthen sentiment for independent labor politics and a labor party. Political realignment, about which there has been so much talk for so long, would become a probability, and along more fundamental lines than the liberals have ever conceived. All this would not yet give the Negro what he needs and wants, but it would create infinitely better conditions for him to obtain it than he now has. Contrary to Rustin, “one-tenth of the population” can do quite a lot by themselves when they utilize all the opportunities within their reach.
Rustin claims that independent black politics is “utopian,” but he is the last man who should use that word; it is impossible to think of a more Utopian task than trying to make the world’s major capitalist party “truly responsive to the aspirations of the poor.” Rustin and Feldman attribute Black Power to despair and frustration, but the only sense in which this is true is that increasing numbers of black people are beginning to recognize the futility of trying to reform the Democratic Party; in general, desperate and frustrated people do not undertake a task as difficult as building a new political party. Feldman argues that independent black politics must fail because the Freedom Party suffered “a quick demise.” By this “logic” — that you should never try anything again if it doesn’t succeed at the first attempt — he would have a hard time justifying his policy of working in the Democratic Party after so many decades of defeats and betrayals. The fact is that there is already a sufficiently large body of Negroes disillusioned with the Democratic and Republican parties to provide the initial mass base for an independent black party. According to a recent national survey by Newsweek (printed Aug. 22), 17 per cent of the Negroes [2] are in favor of “dumping the Democratic Party, and going it alone in all-black political organizations, while 74 per cent are against this course. A majority of black people are not yet ready for an independent party, but no political party starts with a majority of its intended constituency. If around one-sixth of the 22–23 million black people are in favor of an independent party now, before it exists, then the possibility of starting such a party, and winning the majority of Negroes to it, certainly cannot be dismissed as Utopian.
When Rustin argues that Black Power moods result from “the belief that the ghetto will last forever,” he may be right. Of course forever is a long time, and it is unhistorical to think the ghetto will survive long after the system that brought it into being is replaced by a non-exploitative system. But militants who expect the ghetto to last forever are more realistic than Rustin, who thinks it will be eliminated by a reformed Democratic Party. Correct strategy and tactics must flow from the understanding that the ghetto is here to stay as long as capitalism stays, and that capitalism will stay as long as the two-party system remains unchallenged. Anyway, all such beliefs are subject to modification through experience. The real question is not how long one believes the ghetto will last, but what one proposes to do about the ghetto: Do you strive to keep its residents handcuffed to capitalist politics, or do you work to liberate them for action by organizing them in a party of their own to fight against capitalist, that is, racist, politics?
The Black Power tendency is clearing the ground for the emergence of an independent black party. The basis for such a party is the oppression common to the Negro people, or, to use the shorthand equivalent in this racist society, their “blackness.” When Rustin complains that Black Power “would give priority to the issue of race” and Feldman that it “continues to bring the racial issue to the forefront,” they are standing things on their heads. The “racial issue” is already to the forefront, it already has priority. The responsibility for that rests on the ruling class, not on SNCC or CORE. What they are attempting to do is utilize a situation that they did not create in order to change the situation; they are attempting to extract certain tactical advantages from that situation that will enable them to organize the black masses, whom the old civil-rights movement never organized and who cannot be organized by the Rustin-Feldman method of denying the importance of the “racial issue.” At the end of this process lies not racism but equality, which will be advanced by the proper mobilization and politicalization of black consciousness, just as a classless society will be achieved through the promotion of proletarian class consciousness.
Jackson’s article avoids many of the pitfalls plunged into by Rustin and Feldman, but only by refusing to discuss some of the basic questions. He is for Black Power if all it means is “the struggle to create the conditions for the Negro people to exercise the power in the areas of their majority.” But he adds, ever so delicately, “In terms of the country as a whole, Negro Americans are more often than not cast in a minority situation.” So? So “more than the political and organizational build-up of ‘Black Power,’ more than the self-organization and militant action of the Negro people themselves is required.” He even seems to be willing to grant, conditionally without enthusiasm, that a “Black Panther” approach may be permissible in certain local situations, but he insists that a different strategy is needed nationally:
“The perspective and struggle to establish Black Power bases of local political control in the deep South and in metropolitan slums of the North ... would prove useful to a total strategy of Negro freedom only insofar as they enhanced the capability of the Negro movement to consummate more favorable alliance relations with comparable disadvantaged and objectively ‘anti-establishment’ classes and forces among the white population.”
 
Anti-Monopoly Coalition
This doesn’t mean quite what it may seem to the unwary reader. When Jackson and the CP talk about “objectively ‘anti-establishment’ classes and forces,” they are not talking only about poor whites or white workers and they are not proposing an anti-capitalist alliance. What they favor is a coalition against the monopoly capitalists, in which “good” and “liberal” capitalists would be included. Politically, they mean the Democratic Party, the same thing the social-democrats mean. The CP wants the black people to remain inside the national Democratic Party even if, in isolated instances, Negroes create local political organizations outside the local Democratic Party. Jackson’s article neither proposes nor attacks the “Black Panther” approach — it is written in the hope of influencing Black Power partisans in a pro-national Democratic Party direction. He will attack the Black Power tendency if it definitively rejects such “favorable alliance relations.” He will call it “political isolationism” — the CP’s name for any breakaway from the Democratic Party to the left.
It is misleading to read “isolationism” into the statements of the major Black Power spokesmen. When they project a new, more independent and more radical movement, and concentrate on the questions that will help to bring it into being, that does not mean they are opposed to alliances with other forces, or indifferent to them. It means only that they are putting first things first. Feldman tries to make fun of the “small groupings of alienated white radicals” (he means chiefly the Socialist Workers Party and the Young Socialist Alliance) who do not see any contradiction between the independent organization of black people and their subsequent collaboration with revolutionary white workers in a struggle against capitalism. He wants us to insist that black people must commit themselves to such collaboration even before they have organized themselves. Thanks immensely for the unalienated advice, Mr. Feldman, but the days are gone when militant Negroes will give blank checks to anyone — and that, we think, is the best thing that’s happened in decades. First things first.
First the Black Power movement will seek to organize the black masses independently, and then they will consider the question of alliances. How can we be sure? Because every movement does that, and has to. Capitalists look for allies, small businessmen look for allies, the labor movement looks for allies. The real question is what kind of alliances will an independent black movement seek. Will it be the kind that has existed up to now, where the methods and goals are dictated by other forces, and where black people are subordinates, with little voice and little choice but to do the legwork? Or will it be a new kind of alliance, where the blacks will have an equal say in the leadership and determination of policy — and the power to withdraw from unsatisfactory arrangements precisely because they are independently organized? The difference between an independent movement and a dependent movement is not over their willingness to enter into alliances, but over the kinds of alliances they enter.
The thing that worries the Socialist and Communist parties about the Black Power tendency is not that it may reject alliances, but that it may reject alliances limited to reforming capitalism and the Democratic Party. Here their fears are soundly based. For the emergence of an independent mass black movement will create “a major crisis” for the non-revolutionary Socialist and Communist parties as well as the Democratic Party.

Footnote
1. In the summer Stokely Carmichael and Rep. Adam Clayton Powell jointly announced that a Black Power conference would be held in Washington later in the year. Powell’s advocacy of Black Power was seized on by Feldman (“it is especially to be noted”) and Rustin (“it is no accident”) as evidence of its non-radical character. It turned out to be poor evidence. On Sept. 8 Powell explained that he was trying to “channelize” the tendency to assume constructive roles in American society. Later, on Oct. 9, the Harlem opportunist publicly denounced Carmichael and said, “Any effort to tie me with the SNCC definition of black power is totally erroneous.”
2. There is a close correspondence between this figure and the 19 per cent of the Negroes surveyed who voiced approval of Floyd McKissick and Stokely Carmichael as leaders.
 



For two and a half years the scribes of the Independent
Socialist League, formerly the Workers Party (Shachtmanites), wrote
scores of articles to demonstrate that “Titoism” is only another form
of Stalinism, and just as reactionary. Simultaneously, they
hysterically denounced the Socialist Workers Party and the Fourth
International for approaching the Yugoslav Communist Party
sympathetically and trying to influence its development in a
revolutionary Marxist direction.
Now, however, judging from an article by Henry Judd in the
March-April issue of the New International, the ISL
line seems in process of change. Judd was one of the noisiest critics
of our policy on Yugoslavia; only four months before the present
article his summation of the entire Yugoslav development since the
split with the Kremlin was that “the direction in Yugoslavia is away
from socialism and Workers’ Statism.” Now — after throwing up the
smokescreen that “all” parties suffered from “short-sightedness,
superficiality and a failure to grasp the full significance of this
[Yugoslav] development,” with the Trotskyists “of course” being the
“outstanding example of this” — he declares:
“Titoism must now be redefined as a legitimate and
serious international tendency, politically and ideologically, within
the revolutionary movement; it must be recognized as the first of many
other similar developments which, springing out of the world of
Stalinism, must be accepted as harbingers of new, hitherto unknown,
ideological currents with which socialists must sympathetically
collaborate.”
This is the position that we have taken, both in words
and actions, ever since the Tito-Stalin split three years ago. And this
is the position that Judd and the ISL kept denouncing not only as
shortsighted, ignorant, etc., but as a capitulation to Stalinism.
How account for this sudden turnabout? Judd tries to explain it away
(even while apologizing for the old ISL line in the past) in the
following manner:
“The real fact of the matter is that both in terms of
internal political ideology and international politics, Titoism has
already passed beyond its early characteristics which permitted it to
be defined more or less correctly, if abstractly, as a Stalinist
movement, or a bureaucratic clique seeking to retain power by a
neutralist position in a divided world.”
Judd does not explicitly indicate what “early
characteristics” he is referring to, and he remains very vague about
when it was that Titoism passed beyond them. But because this is the
central issue, we ourselves must stress that the policies of the
Yugoslav leaders have undergone important shifts since 1948, and show
both what these shifts were and when they took place.

From the middle of 1948 to about the middle of 1949. This was the
period when the Yugoslav CP leaders tried to minimize their differences
with the Kremlin, withheld from the workers the full details and
history of the split, refused to engage in any criticism of Stalin and
Stalinism, and in general left the way open for a reconciliation.
From the middle of 1949 to the late summer or fall of 1950. Now
the Yugoslav leaders, faced with a tightening Cominform blockade and
openly designated as targets for assassination by the GPU, took a
decided turn to the left. They began to re-examine some of the
fundamental theories of Stalinism, the nature of the Soviet
bureaucracy, etc., and to move toward conclusions in accord with those
of Marxism. They disclosed the full history of their dispute with the
Kremlin, called on the workers of the world to return to Leninism, and
undertook a number of democratic reforms within their own country. At
the same time they proclaimed a foreign policy of independence from
both Washington and Moscow, although (his policy even then was not
without serious faults.
From the fall of 1950 to the present time. The outbreak of the
war in Korea brought an increased danger of a Kremlin-directed assault
on Yugoslavia together with increased pressure from Washington for
concessions from Belgrade in return for material aid to combat the
famine threatening the country. The Yugoslav leaders drew back,
especially in, their foreign policy, endorsed the UN policy on Korea,
promised to go to war on the side of the UN anywhere in Europe, and
began to make compromising advances to the international Social
Democracy.

When was it, according to Judd, that Titoism changed
from “a Stalinist movement” into “a legitimate and serious
international tendency, politically and ideologically, within the
revolutionary movement?” Was it in 1949, when the Yugoslav leaders were
moving to the left? Or was it at the end of 1950, when they were
unmistakably moving to the right and collaboration with US imperialism?
Judd evades a direct answer. But it sticks out all over his article
— in the timing of his decision that a “redefinition” of Titoism is in
order, in the way he denounces us for criticizing the present
anti-internationalist foreign policy of the Yugoslav regime, and above
all in his insistence that “Titoism is clearly deepening the gap
between itself and Stalinism.”
What does Judd mean by this? A year ago Titoism was engaging in a
furious ideological struggle against Stalinism and dealing the Kremlin
damaging blows that reverberated all over Eastern and Western Europe —
and from the left. But nothing Tito did then could produce the
slightest expression of support from the ISL. What new thing has been
added that persuades Judd a genuine change for the better has taken
place within Titoism? Only one thing — Tito has abandoned his hesitant
moves to the left in the international field, submitted to the pressure
of Washington and apparently decided that his future is linked with the
camp of US imperialism.
From the viewpoint of Marxism, Tito is actually less anti-Stalinist
today than he was a year ago, for now he has completely reverted to the
kind of foreign policy he learned in the Kremlin school — collaboration
with imperialism, apologetics for the imperialist powers he hopes will
aid him as allies, dependence on the UN, and so on. In other words, the
very changes in Tito’s policy which endanger the revolutionary future
of Yugoslavia and merit the sharpest criticism of revolutionary
socialists are just the ones that have earned Judd’s admiration and
endorsement.
Thus the thinking that underlies Judd’s revision is far more
revealing than the revision itself — thinking that Judd shares with
most of his fellow ISL leaders, including some who are not yet ready to
subscribe to his new position on Yugoslavia.
The fashion on Titoism, so far as American petty bourgeois radicals
and Stalinophobes are concerned, is set in Washington. Judd may not be
aware of this, but he reacts to it instinctively; that is why he is the
most reliable weathervane of the ISL leadership. Proceeding in the
belief that his policy of both yesterday and today contributes to the
struggle against Stalinism, which the ISL regards as its No.1 enemy, he
is actually twisted and turned by the pressure of the tail-end of
American imperialism.
The Shachtmanites don’t know where they are going, but almost
everyone else does. Long before Judd began his “redefinition,” it was
predicted by our movement. As Murry Weiss put it in his political
report on the Yugoslav question at the SWP Convention last November:
“The Social Democrats and centrists, who belatedly
recognized the importance of the Yugoslav affair, are attracted to the
worst features of the Yugoslav Communist Party and its policies. They
are ‘Titoist’ whenever there is any indication of a swing to the right
[on the part of the Yugoslav leaders] ... As for the Shachtmanites —
they are not in our class camp but are simply a special case of left
Social Democracy.”
A special case of left Social Democracy, but one which
is steadily losing its special traits. This is manifested not only by
their policy on Yugoslavia, but by their advocacy that labor
participate in capitalist party primaries, their unceasing internal
dispute over whether or not to support US imperialism in Korea and the
next world war, the increasing concessions which the openly
social-patriotic and pro-war wing of the organization wrings from its
opponents.
The Shachtmanites are an instructive example of the consequences of
Stalinophobia in the present tense world situation. They originally
split away from the Socialist Workers Party in 1940, saying they could
not remain in one party with advocates of the defense of the Soviet
Union against imperialism. Today they feel at home in one party with
advocates of support of imperialist war against the Soviet Union. What
price Third Camp?



This year Negro History Week begins Feb. 8. Its purpose is to encourage understanding and study of the history of the Negro people and thus to sweep away the lies and slanders which have the same function as restrictive covenants and Jim Crow cars – to maintain racial oppression and exploitation. In line with that purpose, we will try here to draw some conclusions from those aspects of American Negro history; which seem most significant to us.
What is the real Negro tradition in this country? It is the tradition of long, continuous, never-ending struggle against oppression, waged under the most difficult conditions and carried on with militancy and self-sacrifice. This fight has been going on ever since the first Negro stepped onto American soil; it never stopped during more than two centuries of slavery, and it is still going on after 80 years of “second-citizenship.”
This resistance movement assumed different forms, depending on prevailing conditions – slave insurrections, individual rebellions, escape through the Underground Railway, participation in the abolitionist movement, service in the Northern Army, sabotage and arson in the South, support to the glorious Re-construction effort, creation of Negro organizations, active work and leadership in progressive political and labor movements, picket lines to win jobs, armed defense against lynch mobs, bitter skirmishes against Jim Crow in the armed forces, mass movements to win the right to vote, campaigns for progressive legislation. How many groups in the world have, a finer or richer record of combat against oppression? Not many that we know of.
In some of these struggles the Negro people had powerful allies fighting at their side, in others they had to fight alone. The important thing to note is that when they had to stand alone, and fought just the same, they succeeded in arousing and inspiring and winning over those other enemies of the ruling class who had not previously realized their kinship with the Negro people. To mention only two examples: the slave insurrections at the beginning of the 19th century gave a strong impetus to the birth and growth of abolitionist sentiment in the North; and in our own time the Negro struggle against lynching, the poll tax and job discrimination have awakened the trade union movement to their own responsibility to fight against these things.
There are valuable lessons to be learned from this. Whatever progress the Negro people made in the past was due, in the first place, to their own organized efforts; whatever progress they make in the future will be due to the same. Equality will not be handed to them on a silver platter; they have to fight for it themselves.
The final victory against Jim Crow cannot be won by the Negro people alone. But it cannot be won at all unless the Negro people show the same readiness to fight and die for freedom that their forefathers did. The harder they fight, the sooner they will receive the necessary support and reinforcements from the organized labor movement.
 



The differences between independent labor political action and the Stalinist third party policy were clearly delineated in the speech made by Communist Party General Secretary Eugene Dennis at a mass meeting in New York on Jan. 15. This speech made it plain that while the CP is now attacking the two-party system, in line with the world-wide “left turn” ordered by the Kremlin, it is still fighting by every means at its command to prevent the mobilization of the workers as an independent class force in U.S. politics.
Any discussion of the CP’s present policy naturally raises the question of its previous opposition to the formation of a new party. Dennis “disposes” of that embarrassing issue as follows:
“It is a matter of public record that for many, many years the Communist Party, together with other advanced workers, pioneered for a new political alignment to free the working class and its popular allies from the two-party system of Big Business.”
The truth is, of course, that “for many, many years” the Stalinists had been running up and down the country denouncing those workers who wanted a new party. They campaigned vigorously in 1944 for the election of Roosevelt and Truman: after that election, their members at the CIO convention reaffirmed their opposition to a third party as something that would divide the “forces of progress” in the Democratic Party.
Even as late as the 1946 elections they backed Truman’s candidates. At last month’s CIO Executive Board meeting, Murray, whose opposition to the Wallace movement is wholly reactionary, reminded the Stalinists, with malicious glee, of their own extensive hatchet work on behalf of the two-party system.
Dennis can’t publicly explain the real reason why the CP line changed, but it is well known. Stalin wants a pact with Truman, like the one he had with Hitler. And he is trying to get it by political pressure and blackmail. Dennis can’t admit this because to do so would be to admit that if a Stalin-Truman deal is worked out, the CP will again be waving the flag for the two-party system.
While the Stalinist line was thus changed and given a more radical appearance, its main function is still the bureaucratic manipulation of the American workers in the interests of the Kremlin’s foreign policy. The crass character of this manipulation is evident in the very manner in which the new line is being carried out.
First of all, Wallace is given the real domination of the movement. That gives the party a leader – acceptable to the Stalinists, even though he is an avowed defender of capitalism, because he too wants a deal with Stalin. But, of course, the party needs more than a leader if it is to achieve the Stalinists’ ends. So Dennis lays down the directive for the next steps:
The Stalinists, he declares, “must in the first place guarantee that the third party has a strong trade union base.” What does this mean – that the unions should get together in a conference, democratically discuss the ways and means to fight the two Wall Street parties, and strike out on the course of independent labor political action by setting up their own party? Not according to Dennis.
 
Endorse – Not Control
By a “strong trade union base” the Stalinists don’t mean that the unions should control the party, have the deciding voice in determining policy, candidates, leaders, structure, etc. Oh no, what they actually mean is that as many unions as possible should be gotten to endorse the party, finance it, do the bell-ringing and Jimmy Higgins work – just as the Stalinist-dominated unions did for the Democratic Party. Of course, the unions should be given greater representation than they got in the Democratic Party – how else can you get their support? But control, direction, the dominating influence – these are the last things in the world the Stalinists propose to let the unions have in their new party.
It is obvious that this flagrantly bureaucratic method – “Here it is, all worked out, take it or leave it” – will antagonize and repel many workers who are ready to break with the two old parties but don’t intend to be used as doormats by anyone. The main (if not the only) “trade union base” resulting from such a procedure will be the unions dominated by the Stalinists.
 
United Front from Below
But, Dennis consoles the members of the CP, everything is going to work out OK anyhow, because:
“In the present situation all who truly wish to advance working class unity see that the Wallace movement is based on and stimulates the united front of struggle from below. It is serving to unite not only the consistent advocates of a new people’s party and coalition, but also hundreds of thousands of rank and file workers in auto, steel, clothing and other important industries. Those who are genuinely interested in advancing working class unity will therefore help to build this united front of action from below ...”
But what is the “united front from below?” Translated from Stalinism to English, it is a promise that workers can be won to the third party even if the organized labor movement is by-passed. True enough, this can be done to a limited extent.
But what you will have then is not a party representing and speaking for and controlled by the labor movement, but another party not controlled by labor to which workers happen to belong. Such a party may be manipulated to serve the political blackmail interests of Stalinism, but it cannot serve the interests of independent labor political action.
 



Dear Uncle:
Thanks for your letter about the Italian strikes.
I hope that by this time you have received the CARE package we sent. As soon as our budget allows, we will send another. But that is not the purpose of this letter, I am writing this at the suggestion of a man with considerable power in our government, the Honorable Alexander Wiley of Wisconsin, a Republican member of the U.S. Senate who is noted for speeches extolling the quality of cheese produced in his state. Sometimes he discusses broader subjects in the Senate, as he. did when he said recently:
“American citizens writing abroad should write about true conditions in America, stressing the many blessings that we enjoy in this land of freedom, the comforts, the conveniences, as well as stressing the aid that we have already extended abroad for the noblest of humanitarian purposes – both as individuals and as a nation.”
This strikes me as a good idea.
First, a word or two about that chief blessing, the high American standard of living. Of course, it is higher than the Italian standard, but it is nothing like what you sec in the Hollywood films. Money wages are much higher than ever before, but that is true in Italy too. isn’t it?
Last week a New Jersey mechanic, told a Senate committee he earns $2,500 a year, but because of high prices he and his family do not have enough food or milk, or money for medical care. “We are just existing, not living,” he said.
And in Cleveland, a post office worker earning $2,700 a year, declared he and his family had been better off during the depression when he worked in a steel mill for 60c an hour, or less than $1,300 a year. To be worse off than during the terrible depression my father used to write you about such blessings we can well do without.
I think you have already had the chance to become familiar with some of the other blessings we enjoy in this land of freedom.
For example, President Truman has for the last ear been carrying on a “loyalty” campaign to terrorize and drive out of the government all employees holding ideas which he labels as “subversive.” Mussolini, if I recall rightly, did the same.
Congress has passed a savage anti-labor law to discourage strikes and. regiment the unions. You yourself have written us how the fascist government issued similar decrees. Truman broke a national strike to make the railroads run on time. Mussolini achieved some of his fame in a like manner.
In Oklahoma a girt has been denied admission to the state law school solely because of the color of her skin. Mussolini’s fascist press also spouted “white supremacy” doctrines when, his planes dropped bombs and gas on the helpless Ethiopians.
Generals and bankers are the undisputed lords and masters in Washington, even as they were in Italy after the First World War. One of their chief demands is peace-time conscription; evidently they were impressed by the successes it won for Mussolini and Hitler.
The people groan under the burden of heavy taxes, extorted in the name of preserving peace through a vast war preparation program.
I could continue indefinitely in this vein about the “true conditions” in this country. But I don’t want you to get a wrong impression. I am not saying that America today is like fascist Italy in every respect, but that the capitalist class in America is like the capitalist class in fascist Italy – only more powerful and therefore more dangerous. If they have their way, an American Duce will put us all on a castor oil diet.
But we intend to see to it that they don’t have their way. When the American workers get done correcting things, we’ll take that atom bomb out of their hands and put them to work at useful labor. If they still want to make the railroads run on time, we’ll give them honest jobs as firemen or ticket-punchers.



 


Your devoted nephew,
John






 



Credit for the scurviest hack job of the week goes to Allan L. Swim, editor of the CIO News, for an article on Henry Wallace in that paper’s Feb. 16 issue, Hank May Have Meant Well But – He Caused Trouble.
Swim is one of those bureaucrats who can hardly conceal their low opinion of the union members’ intelligence. Discussing Wallace’s record in three high government jobs, he says:
“In none of these posts did he distinguish himself as a champion of the things for which labor was fighting ... he didn’t roll up his sleeves and get into the fray when the chips were down and the going was tough. CIO officials who called on him for aid learned to regard him as a ‘preaching liberal’ – not as a ‘practicing liberal’.”
Now, that happens to be the truth. But it will certainly come as news to those CIO members whose estimate of Wallace was formed on the basis of what they read about him in the CIO News in the past, arid of what they were told in a thousand speeches by Philip Murray and all the little Murrays.
Do Swim and Murray think that the members of the CIO have forgotten what happened at the Democratic Party convention in 1944, when Murray, Hillman and the other PAC leaders almost busted a gut pleading for the renomination of that “preaching liberal” – Henry Wallace? Do they think the workers are going to follow the CIO leadership’s political counsel today when they see what shameless lies they were told yesterday?
Continuing his attack on Wallace, Swim then makes another very damaging admission:
“It should have been obvious to anybody with political savvy that a successful third party would have to stem from the labor movement. There simply is no other group in the country large enough to smash the two-party tradition.”
That is a completely valid criticism of Wallace and the Stalinists who, instead of trying to build a party based on the unions, are trying to build one that may have the support of union members but will remain under their own control. But doesn’t this criticism apply to the labor leaders too.
For years they have been telling the workers that the unions are “too weak” to form their own Labor Party. Now, just in passing, they blandly admit that labor is “large enough” to smash the two-party swindle. Thanks to the labor leaders, it wasn’t done and the two-party system gave birth to such children as the Taft-Hartley Act.
And today, when that system is hatching even worse anti-labor monsters, these labor bureaucrats, instead of hiding their heads in shame, have the gall, to chatter about “political savvy” and to give lectures about not splitting the so-called “progressive” vote (which, in line with their directives, wasn’t split in 1946 and produced the most reactionary Congress in American history).
If a policy cowardly and stupid as that can be palmed off as political savvy, then I’ll take Mortimer Snerd in preference to 95% of the self-styled labor statesmen any day in the week. Mortimer may not be very bright, but at least his backbone isn’t made of jelly and his tongue is used for other purposes than licking the boots of his enemies.
 



Nothing embarrasses the American capitalists so much as the truth about their own revolutionary past. That is illustrated in their current eulogies of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, on the occasion of their birthday celebrations. How the present rulers hate to be reminded that the United States was born and grew great as the result of two revolutions conducted and won by “force and violence”! How they squirm at the memory that their own ancestors led “subversive” movements! How they sweat, even while paying tribute to these two national heroes, to obscure and belittle the real significance, achievements and traditions of the 18th and 19th century revolutionists!
The reasons for such behavior are not hard to find. When American Big Business is reaching out for imperialist domination of the world and using all its resources to preserve an outworn and oppressive social system, it is naturally not interested in extolling American revolutions and civil wars for independence and the establishment of new social systems.
But every man should have his due, and those of us who are the most consistent fighters against the tyranny of Big Business willingly give credit to the revolutionary forerunners of the present ruling class for the struggles they led against tyranny in the past. For us, unlike the apologists of Big Business, the truth about the revolutionary past, and such figures as Washington and Lincoln, is not a source of embarrassment but of enlightenment and inspiration, providing many rich lessons still applicable in the current struggles against oppression.
 
Why They Are Remembered
Washington and Lincoln are remembered with affection by the American people above all because they were leaders of revolutionary struggles. True, they were not the most consistent or most far-sighted leaders of these struggles and there was much that they left undone, but that does not detract from the honor due them for what they were and what they did achieve.
The fight for independence from Britain and for democracy in the American Colonies did not begin when Washington took command of the Continental armies. That struggle had been going on for many years before 1776; with the most energetic role being played by the radical elements among the working population. It assumed organized form with the demonstrations by the Sons of Liberty against the oppressive Stamp Act and then ebbed and flowed for over ten years before it erupted in civil war to overthrow the British crown.
The revolution was made by an alliance between several classes – the planters of the South, the radical merchants of the North, the farmers, and the artisans and mechanics in the cities. The merchants and planters were sometimes at odds with the democratic and popular elements; they were often shocked by the militant methods of the masses, and they showed a greater readiness to conciliate with the British. But compromise was, not in the cards, and in the end the planters and merchants provided most of the top leaders for the revolution.
George Washington represented the Virginia planters and laud speculators. He himself was the richest planter in the colonies. Like the others of his class he deeply resented British restrictions and taxes which held down the native propertied interests in favor of their British counterparts.
He became part of a syndicate that laid claim to hundreds of thousands of acres on the western frontier. As a youth he made a trip to this territory to survey it. Later he joined Braddock’s troops to smash the French attempt to seize this territory. But the Quebec Act of 1765 took away the colonists’ right to claim these lands and reserved them for the British crown. Measures of this kind were the source of Washington’s radicalism.
Freedom from British rule therefore had a very definite content for men like Washington. It meant the chance to end British taxation, the opportunity to repudiate debts that were crushing many planters and merchants, it meant free trade and free access to the land. It meant freedom for capitalist relations here to expand without hindrance by the British. To the poor farmers and working people it also meant many of these things – and much more besides: A chance for greater equality, democracy, opportunity. Thus they were able to unite in the struggle against the common foe.
 
“Seditious and Subversive”
That struggle was labelled seditious, disloyal and subversive by the forces of “law and order” – and so it was from the viewpoint of the British crown and its Tory supporters in America. But that’s how American democracy came into power – by defying oppressive edicts and laws and by overthrowing oppressive institutions and governments. American history would have taken a different and less dynamic course if the Revolutionists of the 1770s had capitulated to the powers-that-be in the way that the labor bureaucrats today have capitulated to the Taft-Hartley Slave Labor Act.
Washington was neither the founder, the theoretician nor the political leader of the revolution. His selection as commander-in-chief was due primarily to the desire of the Massachusetts merchants to cement their alliance with the Virginia planters. But he grew steadily in stature as a leader.
Those were the times that tried men’s souls; the revolutionary war was conducted under extremely discouraging conditions and lasted for seven long years. But Washington never faltered. He “pledged his life, his fortune and his sacred honor” to the rebel cause, and in the end he led it to victory. That alone was enough to establish his claim to lasting fame and gratitude in the hearts of his countrymen.
But although the first successful revolution laid the foundation for a free and united nation and for the development of the productive forces, its results were not equally satisfactory to all the classes participating and it did not by any means achieve all the democratic changes sought by the masses. The merchants and planters, taking over the reins of government, made considerable gains, but they retained slavery, limitations on the right to vote and many other anti-democratic restrictions. The manufacturers and slaveholders who came to the fore as the new ruling classes were on the whole content, but the working people found it necessary to continue the struggle for freedom and security.
The next major phase of this struggle was conditioned by the rise of a new obstacle to progress – the growing power and domination of the slaveholders, whose interests clashed more and more with those of the other classes. The slaveholders demanded the extension of the slave system, westward as the country expanded, domestic and foreign policies favoring the slave system, further restrictions on the democratic rights of the enemies of slavery, etc. And since they controlled all branches of the federal government, they got much of what they wanted.
Again it was the masses who launched the fight against reaction. The radical farmers and workers, who wanted access to the western lands coveted by the slaveholders, pressed for vigorous action against the slaveholding oligarchy, and where necessary fought them, arms in hand, long before the outbreak of the Civil War. The slaves, who wanted freedom, staged rebellions, ran away, organized underground railways and engaged in other forms of active and passive resistance. The petty bourgeois abolitionist movement carried on militant propaganda and agitation for emancipation. And they were joined later by the Northern capitalists, who could expand production and intensify the exploitation of the national resources only on the basis of wage labor and the overthrow of the slaveholders’ power.
Like Washington, Abraham Lincoln represented the conservative rather than the more radical elements in the revolutionary coalition of his time. Unlike Washington, he was born poor and had to educate himself and make his own way in society. A product of the small-farming system on the frontier seething with democratic ideas, the slave system had no attraction for him. Like many talented youth in that period, he placed himself at the service of the rising capitalist class, becoming a lawyer for the Illinois Central Railroad.
He entered politics and proved to be a skillful speaker. His humble origins and frontier background enhanced his popularity among the masses; his carefully expressed political views won him a following among the capitalist politicians. He shone most brightly in the task of mediator and arbitrator between the right and left wings of the Republican Party which was formed in 1854 to bring together most of the opponents of the slaveholders.
 
The Crucial Emancipation Issue
While Lincoln opposed the extension of slavery to the western territories and worked on behalf of the capitalists to take the power out of the hands of the slaveholders’ representatives in Washington, his stanef on slavery was conciliatory to say the least. For one thing, he favored enforcing the fugitive slave law; for another, he preached the sanctity of the U.S. Constitution which permitted slavery. Even after his election to the presidency and the outbreak of the slaveholders’ insurrection, he refused for two years to accede to the demand of the abolitionists that he emancipate the slaves.
His first concern was to maintain (and then regain) the unity of the country and safeguard the newly acquired political power of the capitalist class. He said again and again that he would do this any way he could – by preserving slavery if necessary – or by abolishing it. The long protracted and hard-fought Civil War convinced him that he had no alternative, and from Jan. 1, 1863 he was compelled to take the road of the abolitionists.
That is a tribute to the far-sightedness of the most radical elements in the fight against the slave system. Lincoln’s hesitancy and reluctance to take the step which won him the love and admiration of succeeding generations strike an ironic note today. But they do not and cannot take away from him the credit for carrying through this great act that dealt the death blow to the slave system, nor for his stubborn prosecution of the war that smashed the counter-revolution.
This second revolution cleared the way for the rapid development of capitalism and the growth of our modern industrial civilization with its potentiality for universal abundance. But again most of the benefits were drained off by the ruling class. Establishing themselves as a dictatorship of Big Business, the capitalists began in the interests of private profit to erect their own roadblocks in the path to freedom and security for those who had done the hardest fighting in the second American revolution – the workers, poor farmers and Negroes. And so the masses today are driven by the very conditions of their existence in the direction of a third American revolution.
 
Nature of the Coming Revolution
This time the goal is on a higher plane than in the past. It is nothing less than the abolition of capitalism and the establishment of a Workers and Farmers Government preparing the way for a classless society. This will climax and complete the progressive tasks begun in the earlier American revolutions. At the same time it will open a new chapter in world history, for the other nations will not be far behind once the American colossus shows the way.
This coming revolution cannot be prevented by red scares and witch hunts any more than its predecessors were. Indeed, the working are being steeled and mobilized to take their places in this revolution just as the revolutionists were in the past – by the compulsion to fight against oppressive legislation like the Taft-Hartley Act, the proposed peace time conscription program, the drive to institute thought control through “subversive” blacklists, the ruling class’s refusal to grant equality to the Negro people, the preparations for war, militarization and fascism.
Of course the next revolution will differ in important respects those of the past. Previous revolutions, while they made possible certain advances for humanity, also resulted in the establishment of the rule of a new minority. The coming revolution will for the first time bring power to the representatives of the overwhelming majority of the population.
 
A New Science
Furthermore, while the revolutionists of the past had to improvise and grope their way forward because they were exploring new terrain, the 20th century revolutionists have the advantage of their predecessors’ experience. They have also the benefit of a new science – socialism – which provides them with a guide to action in the present and for the future.
The faults and shortcomings of Washington and Lincoln were due in great part to the fact that they represented classes forming a minority of the population, with interests antagonistic to those of the majority. Instead of them, therefore, the great models of the next revolution will be the Sons of Liberty and John Brown and Negro rebels like Douglass. Gabriel, Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner and Harriet Tubman. But Washington and Lincoln too, will have their place in the hall of fame of the future socialist society. Associated with the father of his country and the great emancipator will be precisely those truths that capitalist propagandists try to gloss over today:
That the upholders of outworn and decaying social systems never voluntarily give up power, but must be driven from the scene by mass action. That revolutionary struggle requires no justification other than the needs of oppressed classes and the requirements of establishing a higher form of society. And that capitalism, which came to power by revolution, can, like other outworn systems, only be replaced by the same process.
 



The Militant is on the ball when it comes to covering. Truman’s strikebreaking, encouragement of high prices, responsibility for witch hunts, fomenting of war, etc. But it seems to me to have fallen down on the job of reporting a story that has many people yelling bloody murder – the celebrated case of Truman and his balcony. In the interests of keeping the record straight and enabling our readers to take a position on this question, let’s review the main issues involved.
First, there is the question of Truman’s whole method. To quote Harold L. Ickes:
“With all the ‘hush-hush’ of the Pendergast Gang getting ready to steal an election in St. Louis, President Truman, an honored and dues-paying member, has suddenly announced that a contract has been let for mutilating the south facade of the White House by building thereon a scabrous balcony. President Truman has not asked the people what they think about his proposed liberty with their White House. He simply tells them what he proposes to do.”
He did consult the Commission of Fine Arts, but when its members unanimously voted against it, Truman stubbornly went ahead just the same.
Second, there is the question of the balcony’s cost, which will run to $15,000. An angry suburbanite matron explodes: “The inconsistency of using money for unnecessary government expenditures while sending, Congress a message dwelling on the dangers of inflation!”
Third, where is the $15,000 coming from? Frederick Muhlenberg (R., Pa.) took the floor in the House of Representatives and pointed out:
“The president has indicated that he will use maintenance and repair funds for a capital improvement. It is just as illegal for him to do this as it would be for any one else to switch funds from the specific purpose for which they were authorized to another purpose.”
Fourth, and most frequently heard, is the complaint that Truman’s procedure in this matter constitutes a violation of “good taste, propriety and historical feeling” because no temporary tenant of the White House has the right to change the structural appearance of this “national shrine.”
Truman apparently can endure charges of secret maneuvering, arrogance, promotion of inflation, misuse of funds, etc. But the charge that he doesn’t have an “historical feeling” got under his skin, and he heatedly defended himself against it at a press conference. As a matter of fact, he said, historic precedent is on his side. Those who are condemning him are the same kind of people who wanted to lynch the wife of President Fillmore when she installed the first bathtub in the White House way back in the 1850’s. With that argument Truman felt he had neatly floored his critics. After all, who is going to take a stand against bathtubs?
Well, there you have the facts and you are free to draw your own. conclusions. Personally, I think we can all agree with one aspect of Truman’s argument: It’s about time some changes were made in the White House. And I am not talking about architecture.
 



Jim Crow segregation of Negro soldiers is “in the interest of national defense.” That’s what Secretary of the Army Royall said last week, and he wasn’t speaking for himself alone. That is the view of all the brass hats and of both capitalist parties and of the Truman administration, just as it was of the Roosevelt administration during the last war.
They feel so strongly about it that Royall, while grudgingly granting the New Jersey National Guard permission to enlist members on a non-segregated basis “for the present,” in effect warned the other 47 states that they would be denied funds and equipment for their National Guards if they tried to do the same. You can see how vital this question is to the brass hats who, while howling for more military appropriations and peacetime conscription, are willing to disrupt and paralyze a section of their armed forces reserves rather than permit any interference with the reign of Jim Crow.
This question is equally vital to the Negro people and the organized labor movement. To understand how vital, just stop and ask yourself: What kind of “national defense” is it that requires the degrading separation of white and Negro troops? What is actually being defended under conditions where soldiers are driven into military ghettos solely on the basis of the color of their skins?
Democracy and the four freedoms? That is what the capitalist rulers and their servile propagandists say, but it is an obscene lie. With their mouths they spout beautiful phrases, but their hands wield the whip of “white supremacy” even in the armed forces.
When they talk about “national defense,” they are not talking about democratic practices, which they violate a thousand times each day. They are talking about defense of the capitalist system – of profits to be coined out of the exploitation of labor at home and abroad. What they want to defend is the “American way of life” that enables them to suck these profits out of the toll of the working people.
Racial discrimination and oppression are basic parts of that “way of life” because they divide the workers and thus make it easier for them to be exploited. In that sense the capitalists are wholly correct in contending that military Jim Crow is “in the interest of national defense.”
But such “national defense” is not in the interest of the workers. The result of “national defense” in World War II was monstrous profits for the employers, the Taft-Hartley Act for the unions, raging inflation for the consumers, and attempts to perpetuate the second-class citizenship status of the Negro people in all spheres of life. What reason is there to think that “national defense” in World War III will have any different or better outcome?
What the workers need to defend and extend are their democratic rights. To do that they must unite, regardless of color, and fight relentlessly against the reactionary defenders of exploitation, oppression and Jim Crow. “National defense” will have real meaning for the working people only after they have taken the nation out of the grip of the capitalist enemies of democracy and begun to run it on a truly democratic basis.
 



Listening to the speeches, messages, resolutions, documents and platform planks pouring out of the various campaign headquarters nowadays, you might get the impression that nothing is too good for the Negro people and other minorities. In that case, you will be surprised next December, when all the shouting is finished and the votes are counted, to find the minorities in pretty much the same position as before.
Of course, the battle of the demagogues is just getting started and you haven’t seen anything yet. But already it is plain that in 1948 the sky will be the limit in campaign promises to the important Negro vote. Taft promises he will fight against segregation in the proposed peacetime conscription program. Wallace calls for the complete abolition of Jim Crow. Truman rushes off his civil rights message to Congress with a list of points long advocated by the Negro and labor movements.
There is an old saying: By their fruits ye shall know them. Taft never lifted a finger against segregation in the armed forces either in peace or war. Wallace never abolished Jim Crow in the cabinet departments he headed. And Truman’s fruits are just as rotten.
To prove that, we call attention to just one aspect of his Feb. 3 message to Congress.
“During the recent war and in the years since its close we have made much progress toward equality of opportunity in our armed services without regard to race, color, religion or national origin,” he said. “I have instructed the Secretary of Defense to take steps to have the remaining instances of discrimination in the armed services eliminated as rapidly as possible.”
We won’t go into a lengthy argument here about the falsity of Truman’s remark about “progress toward equality” in the armed forces; every Negro who ever had anything to do with the armed forces knows that segregation (the foundation of discrimination) is the most rigidly enforced policy in the armed forces, and that instead of getting better, it is getting worse all the time.
But here is the main point: Truman tells Congress to act on the poll tax, lynching, FEPC, etc., because they are in its department. Correct – but what about the issues that are in his own department? As commander-in-chief of’ the armed forces, Truman has the power to issue an executive order outlawing segregation in the Army, Navy, Marines and Coast Guard. He doesn’t need the permission of Congress or anyone else to do this, and he could do it this very day if he wanted to. Instead, he makes a vague reference about instructing the Secretary of Defense to do something about discrimination – while he completely skirts around the crucial issue of segregation.
Some Negro leaders are going around saying that this is fine. Let the candidates keep on bidding against each other, they say, and then let the Negro people vote for the one who promises the most. But if the Negroes deliver their votes on this basis, it will be worse than selling their birthright for a mess of pottage, If worse comes to worst, you can always eat pottage, but you can’t get any nourishment at all out of campaign demagogy and claptrap.
 



NEW YORK, Feb. 18 – Clouds of gloom settled over Democratic Party national headquarters and the White House last night as their candidate for Congress from the 24th District in the Bronx went down to crushing defeat by the Wallace-endorsed candidate of the American Labor Party. This first electoral test for the Wallace movement strengthened the likelihood that Truman’s goose is cooked unless he is able to work out some deal with Wallace.
The political wise-acres had marked down a victory for the Democrats as a sure thing in this district that has been controlled by Boss Flynn for decades. They even went in for speculation that anything less than 30% for the ALP candidate, Leo Isacson, would represent a moral setback for Wallace.
But Isacson got 56% of the 40,000 votes cast yesterday, against 31% for the Democrats, 9% for the Liberal Party, and 4% for the Republicans, The results in the previous election, in 1946, were 44% for the Democrats, 27% for the ALP, 19% for the Republicans and 10% for the Liberals.
Thus the ALP rolled up more votes than the other three parties combined, surprising even its own leaders: And while the results have given the Democratic machine the jitters, the Republicans are far from happy over them. For by dropping from 19% to 4% of the votes, the GOP has been reduced to the status of “fourth party” in this district.
Of course, the Bronx election results, while providing a test of sentiment, cannot be accepted as a completely accurate reflection of the national political picture. There happened to be a number of exceptional local factors in this case, most of them favorable to the Wallace movement.
 
Exceptional Conditions
For one thing, the vote was only about half the size of the one cast in 1946, and the proportion of Wallace votes would probably go down in a regular election. Another exceptional factor was “the heavy proportion of Jewish voters in this district, something like 50%. and this had an important effect because most Jewish voters are today highly incensed at the transparently two-faced role of the Truman administration on the Palestine issue. Furthermore, this district was the second biggest stronghold of the ALP in the state.
It has also been noted that New York City is the major stronghold of the Communist Party, which is the chief representative of the Wallace movement in the trade unions. The CP forces were able by concentrating their city-wide strength in this district to achieve an effect that would be impossible in a regular election.
All in all, however, the election results are definite proof that dissatisfaction with the two-party system is spreading; that Wallace’s break with the Democrats has enhanced his popularity; and that his candidacy can cut heavily into the normally Democratic and Republican vote.
 
Desperate Situation
The Democrats are now in a desperate situation; and sentiment is sure to grow among them for a deal to regain Wallace’s support. Such a deal entails enormous difficulties, however.
One of the Bronx campaign’s high points was Mayor O’Dwyer’s public appeal on Feb. 12 to “liberals like Henry Wallace” to reconsider the “serious blunder” of leaving the Democratic fold and “return and carry on their fight within the Democratic Party, side by side with us.”
It was notable in Wallace’s reply three days later that he did not explicitly reject this appeal, even though he continued his attacks on the Democratic Party. An estimate of future trends must take into account Wallace’s refusal to definitely commit himself against a return to the Democratic machine, because the future of the movement he leads depends largely on what he decides to do about this.
Drew Pearson reported on Feb. 13: “Henry Wallace has told friends that he would yank his third party out of the running if the Democrats nominate Eisenhower, Douglas, Judge Thurman Arnold or any other Roosevelt Democrat.”
Whatever happens in this respect – and the undemocratic nature of the Wallace movement deprives its members of the right to make the final decision – the ALP landslide in the Bronx has given a black eye not only to the two old parties but also to the Trumanite union bureaucrats who have been vying with each other in denunciations of Wallace.
In New York State they went so far as to split the ALP over this issue. But their attempts to prop up the crumbling two-party system appear to be backfiring on them, rather than on Wallace. If the Bronx election is any indication, the bureaucrats’ repudiation of Wallace, may be transformed into a political repudiation of them by the union members.
 
Danger to Unions
The union leaders are treading on thin ice and may very well be sucked down into the icy waters of defeat along with Truman. That would be poetic justice, but unfortunately it also represents a terrible danger for the union movement as a whole.
That is why the union members must not permit their leaders to carry through the criminal policy of spending millions of the workers’ hard-earned dollars in ‘campaigning for Truman. That is why they must do everything in their power to force the holding of a national United Labor Conference, representing AFL, CtO, Railroad and Independent unions, to work out a new political policy for the working class and to launch an independent Labor Party.
The Bronx elections results are proof that the situation is ripe for a Labor Party. If a party supported by only a part of the unions can beat the two old parties, no limits at all can be placed on the prospects of a national Labor Party based on the whole union movement!
 



“Those no-good, chicken-livered congressmen!” said the General. “They’re a perfect example of what’s wrong with this country. Not enough discipline. Wish I had some of them under my command. I’d teach them ...”
“But after all, it’s perfectly understandable,” said the Banker. “This is an election year, and no matter how much they sympathize with us, they don’t like to take chances. Especially since Wallace has made it such a big issue.”
“I hope no one will feel offended by my bringing this point up again.” said the Preacher a little hesitantly, because the Banker and the General were running the show and didn’t like to be crossed even when things were going well. “But I still think we would have been more successful if we’d called it universal training, rather than universal military training. In delicate situations of this kind a name can play a most important part. If we had only ...”
However, this was an old and familiar complaint, and the others ignored it. The problem now was how to get Congress to pass the peacetime conscription bill, not how to satisfy old women.
“I don’t know what else we can do,” said the Editor with an audible sigh. “Editorials, front page stories, letters to the editor, excerpts from sermons – we can do more of it perhaps, but not better.”
The Bright Young Man who taught philosophy at one of the universities leaned forward and engaged the Banker in a whispered conversation. The General, who could hear them, grunted half-contemptuously and chewed on his cigar. Everyone else waited in respectful silence.
Then the Banker spoke:
“There is no need for us to reproach ourselves. Our work has been so effective that even the AFL Council is reconsidering its traditional opposition to UMT, and you all know how seldom they change their position on anything. The public opinion polls we took so much trouble to arrange have produced ‘results’ exceeding our wildest hopes. The government’s money used for our objectives has been well spent. If necessary, we could stage some dramatic international ‘incident’ but we would prefer to hold that as a last resort. Meanwhile, however, we can proceed to let the people exert direct pressure on Congress. How? By the holding of mass meetings and demonstrations which will raise such a clamor for UMT that Congress will have to act.”
As was to be expected, this proposal met with unanimous acclaim. Plans were quickly formulated. The opening shot in the campaign would be a meeting in New York. No expense was spared, no effort was overlooked, publicity was plentiful. The Seventh Regiment Armory at Park Ave. and 67th St. was chosen as the appropriate place. Feb. 5 was chosen as the time. The National Security Committee, which claims to represent 53 veteran and civilian organizations, all of them 100% patriots and advocates of UMT, was chosen as sponsor of the meeting.
President Truman was asked to send a special message to the audience. The list of distinguished speakers included Owen J. Roberts, former Supreme Court Justice and national chairman of the National Security Committee; Robert P. Patterson, former Secretary of War; Joseph C. Grew, former ambassador to Japan; and in keeping with the civilian tone of the meeting, only one general and no admirals.
* * *
The meeting was a grand success, judging by the four-foot-long report in the Times the next morning. All the dignitaries were present on the speakers’ stand, with lengthy speeches designed to prove peace was impossible without conscription. All the newspapers and press associations were represented at the press table. There was only one hitch – out of 7,835,000 people in New York, the 53 veteran and civilian organizations were able to round up less than 3,000, not counting a couple dozen pickets outside the armory. So we’d better get ready for that international incident.
 



People who live in glass houses should not throw stones. And the Stalinists would be better off if they did not quote Lenin. Such quotations invariably boomerang against them. This is illustrated in their current polemics against Earl Browder.
Two years ago, after 23 years of loyal service to the Kremlin, Browder was ousted from the leadership of the American Communist Party as a Wall Street agent, to use the mildest term of his former fellow bureaucrats.
Browder’s expulsion was not due to any difference in principle with the Stalinists. It resulted from differences in achieving an end sought by all of them – how to continue, or to resume, the wartime honeymoon between U.S. imperialism and the Kremlin. Browder thought the best way to do this was by continuing the policy followed during the war – to give loyal support to U.S. imperialism.
The Stalinists decided, after some vacillation, that the way to do it was by exerting pressure on Washington through such moves as the formation of the Cominform, the strikes in France and Italy, the establishment of the so-called "free" Greek government, the organization of a third party in the U.S. Browder was too committed to the previous policy; so when Stalin changed the line, he was booted out.
Now, according to four articles in the Daily Worker (Dec. 30–Jan. 2) written by CP National Educational Director Jack Stachel, Browder is circulating among key members of the CP advance copies of a pamphlet to justify his policy.
Stachel says that, according to Browder, “because the U.S. joined in the war against the Axis on the side of the Soviet Union, this proves that American imperialism played a ‘progressive’ role. He then says that if American imperialism does not today play a ‘progressive’ role, this is so because Truman does not possess the ‘intelligence’ of Roosevelt.”
 
“Progressive in Past”
“According to Browder’s idealistic conception, imperialism can be either reactionary or progressive ... Browder quotes Lenin’s attack on Kautsky’s definition of imperialism as a policy, a policy preferred by finance capital, to justify his position. But actually, Browder accepts Kautsky’s definition. If imperialism can pursue either a ‘progressive’ or reactionary course determined by its ‘intelligence,’ then what is this if not a ’policy preferred by finance capital?’
“Lenin shows in opposition to Kautsky that imperialism is a stage in the development of capitalism and not just a policy of finance capital. But it is not just a neutral economic category into which can be poured in either a reactionary or ‘progressive’ policy as Browder believes. It is a stage of capitalism which also has its political counterpart.”
And to prove this, Stachel quotes from Lenin’s article, A Caricature of Marxism and Imperialist Economism:
“The political superstructure over the new economics, over monopoly capitalism (imperialism is monopoly capitalism) – is a change from democracy to reaction. To free competition corresponds democracy. To monopoly corresponds political reaction.”
Lenin’s basic teachings thus blow to shreds Browder’s theory about a “progressive” imperialism and show it to be the most arrant revision and rejection of Marxism. But Lenin’s teachings are equally devastating for the official CP policy.
 
Both Then and Now
For if imperialism is a stage in the development of capitalism, and if imperialism invariably takes the political expression of reaction – then it follows that U.S. capitalism, which entered the stage of imperialism more than 30 years ago, played a necessarily reactionary role in World War II, no matter whom it was allied with.
That is what the Trotskyists said before, during and after the war. But the Stalinists – all the Stalinists, Foster and Stachel as well as Browder – vigorously denied this, urging the workers to even break strikes in the interests of supporting U.S. imperialism.
Stachel now seems to criticize Browder for repeating the line they all espoused during the war, but nowhere has the CP withdrawn its characterization of the “progressive” role of U.S. imperialism in that war. And to this day the Stalinists howl about the need to “return to the policies of FDR” – which, according to Leninism, could be nothing but reactionary.
Furthermore, if imperialism is not a policy preferred by the capitalists, but a stage in the development of the capitalist system, then those who administer the capitalist government in Washington necessarily follow an imperialist policy, no matter who they are. Expressed a little differently, it means that whoever administers the government – be it Roosevelt, Truman, Wallace or any other adherent of capitalism – follows an imperialist, that is, reactionary line so long as the government is a capitalist government.
Thus, Lenin’s teachings on the nature of imperialism expose not only the wartime line of the CP, but also its current, fake “leftist” line.
 



In last week’s column we showed there was a suspicious contrast between Henry Wallace’s fine-sounding speeches against Jim Crow nowadays, when he is running for office, and his failure to take action against Jim Crow when he was a high government official. We did it because we knew that his followers would try to cover up the truth about his record.
And sure enough, that is exactly what Benjamin J. Davis, Stalinist New York City Councilman, attempts to do in an article hailing Wallace’s candidacy in the Jan. 4 Worker. Here is what he says:
“For 85 years since the Civil War, the Negro people have seen their hopes for enforcement of their constitutional rights dashed by successive Republican and Democratic Administrations, except for the all-too-brief Roosevelt era.”
It may be too early in the year for predictions, but our guess is that there won’t be a bigger lie than that in all: of 1948. The curious thing about it is that Everybody old enough to read lived through the Roosevelt era, and should know from experience that it is a lie.
What happened in the Roosevelt era (for which Wallace bears as much responsibility as Roosevelt)? Did the administration carry on any kind of campaign to stop lynching? Or the poll tax? Or discrimination in employment? Or segregation in the armed forces? Or restrictive covenants?
The Roosevelt era may have seemed “all-too-brief” for Davis, but for the Negro people it was 13 long years of misery and bitter struggle during which Roosevelt, Wallace and their Jim Crow Southern Democrat pals ganged up to kill every piece of progressive legislation affecting Negro rights.
It is not accidental that Davis begins his Wallace-for-President propaganda by trying to paint up the Roosevelt era in glowing and deceptive colors. After all, Wallace is only trying to repeat the Roosevelt role – which was long on promises and short on performance. Wallace, not being in office, may make even better promises than Roosevelt, but what reason have the Negro people for believing that he will keep them?
When the Stalinists and other Wallaceites come around asking for your support, ask them these questions. Let them, along with the Democrats and Republicans, know that from now on the Negro people will no longer be fooled by the honeyed words of political hypocrites.
* * *
After last week’s column on Wallace had been printed, we were shown a column on the same subject in the Amsterdam News by Lester Granger of the National Urban League, and were asked if there are any differences in our viewpoints. There certainly are. We call attention to the same facts, but for entirely different reasons.
Granger does it because he wants the Negro people to support Truman. We do it because we want the Negro people to join with the union movement in establishing an independent Labor Party which will run labor and Negro candidates in opposition to all the capitalist parties. Our differences with Granger and his fellow Trumanites are just as great as our differences with Wallace or the Stalinists. This will be brought out more clearly as we discuss the Wallace question further.
 



Henry Wallace’s announcement that he will run as a third party candidate for president has exploded like a bombshell on the political arena. It splits the Democratic Party and deals the Truman candidacy a blow from which it may not recover. It opens the way for new political alignments and struggles of crucial significance. Most important, it poses again, and in the sharpest form, the task of the labor movement in the 1948 elections.
Wallace has long been the chief spokesman of those forces who preached the possibility of reforming the Democratic Party into an organization that could serve the interests of the working people, farmers and minorities. His withdrawal from the party will weaken that illusion.
Although the Democrats are trying (with quavering voices) to dismiss the importance of the Wallace move, serious opinion holds that he will draw a strong vote. Because in the absence of a Labor Party, Wallace will exploit the deep-going mass discontent with postwar conditions.
While his program is vague to an extreme and fails to provide an effective alternative to the evils of capitalism, it does denounce those evils and calls on the workers, Negroes and small businessmen to join in a political struggle against them.
But the Wallace movement is not a Labor Party such as the Socialist Workers Party and The Militant have vigorously advocated for many years, and which we will support against the capitalist parties.
A Labor Party is required today because the American workers while strongly organized economically, possess no broad national political organization of their own through which they can defend their interests against the political attacks of the ruling class. But such a party must be an expression of the organized working class, that is, of the trade union movement, and responsible to it.
 
Capitalist Party
That is exactly what the Wallace party is not. Its main base is not the labor movement, but the Stalinists and their liberal fellow-travelers. Its control is not in the hands of the union movement, but of a single individual supported by the Stalinists and those unions influenced by them. Regardless of the support it may pick up from individual workers, it does not have the character of a Labor Party movement. It is a third capitalist party.
Our criticism of this movement has nothing in common with the attacks launched on it bv the official union leaders – the Murrays, Greens, and Reuthers. Their opposition is in part based on their support of the Truman-Marshall Doctrine and of Wall Street’s program for war with the Soviet Union. We criticize the Wallace-Stalinist foreign policy from an opposite point of view; because it fails to oppose the Truman-Marshall Doctrine, with a working class program to abolish capitalism.
The labor bureaucrats further denounce the Wallace movement because they are opposed to any third party, no matter what its character, no matter who controls it. That is because they are on the Truman bandwagon and intend to stump the country trying to line up labor support for the Democratic Party. We, on the other hand, favor the formulation of a Labor Party, the kind that can arouse the necessary support and enthusiasm among the masses to defeat all the capitalist parties.
 
Bureaucrats’ Opposition
The opposition of the union bureaucrats to Wallace does not have any progressive content whatever. Instead of mobilizing the workers as an independent force on the political field, these bureaucrats seek to maintain the capitalist monopoly of politics which is responsible for the Taft-Hartley Act, high prices, housing crisis, racial oppression and the mounting danger of a new war.
Despite their opposition, the top union leaders have, in reality, made possible this Stalinist third party adventure. At a time when even Wallace must break with the discredited Democratic Party and admit that it can no longer be regarded as the lesser of two evils, the Murrays, Greens and Reuthers continue to hang onto this capitalist party, slavishly bolstering it up and trying to whitewash its anti-labor character.
Isn’t it plain that if the departure of Wallace can so shake the Democratic Party, it would crumple and disappear as a national party if the union leaders would break with it? Isn’t it obvious that by taking such a long-overdue step, the unions could quickly replace the Wallace-Stalinist adventure and become the rallying point for all the exploited and oppressed masses in this country?
What is the labor movement going to do in 1948? The reactionary intentions of most of the union bureaucracy are already all too clear. But there is still time for the rank and file workers to intervene.
 
No Explanation
The false argument, repeated by the labor bureaucrats, day in, day out, that “now is not the time” to launch a new party, because it would help elect a Republican, has lost all semblance of reason. Because Truman faces defeat despite the support of the labor union bureaucracy. This false policy of the “lesser evil,” drummed into the heads of the workers by the AFL and CIO leaders, as well as the Stalinists – can how be shaken off more easily. The labor leaders simply do not have any real explanations any more why they will not join in building a new party of labor.
Now, when the whole political situation has been shaken tip by the Wallace move, when political interests among the people is mounting to an air-time high, it is more than ever necessary for the trade unions to meet and to map out a program of united labor political action for 1948.
Now is the time for a United Labor Conference in Washington, to be attended by all the international and, local unions, AFL, CIO, Railroad Brotherhoods and independents. Now is the time for labor’s representatives to get together and democratically discuss the union movement’s attitude toward Truman and toward Wallace. Now is the time for labor to take its rightful place on the political field by launching an independent Labor Party and by running its own candidates for national, state and local office!
 



General Eisenhower is getting a bum deal, and all his friends are springing to his defense. Even those who don’t have much use for the general must concede, in the interests of fair play, that he is the victim of one of the worst frameups in political history.
It’s tough enough for a man to be Chief of Staff while he is running for president. Other candidates whose hats are flying through the air but have not yet landed in the ring, can at least engage openly in politics, and get off as many political speeches as they have wind for. But a five-star general in the post of Chief of Staff can’t speak publicly on anything but the need to spend additional billions of dollars on the armed forces, universal military training and other projects that don’t go over too well with a public already bled white by taxes.
As if that wasn’t bad enough, the general’s rivals for the Republican nomination are trying to discredit him beyond repair by spreading what Life magazine calls “malicious gossip.”
Rumor and slander have always played an important part in American presidential elections. Lincoln was said to be an atheist, Harding the father of a bastard, Al Smith an agent of the Pope, Roosevelt a Jew, etc. But that was in days gone by. The one about Eisenhower, a real product of the atomic age, dwarfs them all into insignificance.
It seems that Eisenhower was a guest at a private Republican dinner in Washington, and that he let go with a few “off the record” remarks during an after-dinner discussion on inflation. And this, according to Fulton Lewis, Jr., is what he said: The government should call in. all the industrialists and have them agree to reduce prices for two or three years and to “eliminate all profits whatsoever”; and if they refused, Congress should tax all profits 100%!
It is easy to understand the gasps of horror that arose in high circles when this story made the rounds. Why, Eisenhower was un-American; as bad as any Bolshevik; even Henry Wallace had never gone that far.
A dirty lie! “Imputed to the general ... are words he never uttered and a supposed ‘program’ to deal with domestic problems which he never proposed,” cried Arthur Krock of the N.Y. Times, who had been present at the dinner. The truth is, said Life, that Eisenhower spoke only “on the need for combating inflation by holding both profits and wages at reasonable levels” – a view repeatedly endorsed by Roosevelt, Hoover, Wallace, Truman, Taft and every last member of the NAM.
The Eisenhower boom is said to have sagged sadly since this incident. Wouldn’t it be ironic, and yet a fitting comment on the times, if he lost the nomination – not because he is a puppet of the sinister military bureaucrats who are out to regiment the youth and to prussianize the nation – but because he was falsely credited with advocating a damned good idea?
 



This week we are going to devote our column to a story reported in the Jan. 16 issue of the Gary American, a Negro paper published in the Calumet steel mill region of Indiana, we are not going to draw any moral from this story, because we think most of our readers will be able to draw it for themselves. All we want to do is repeat that this is a story about Indiana, and not Georgia.
On New Year’s Eve a man was struck by a hit-and-run driver on Catalpa and Guthrie Streets in Chicago. The victim’s name was Paul Rybinski of 3637 Block Ave. Nobody knows who the driver was except the occupants of the car.
“Because the gas station on that corner had no phone, an unidentified man who saw Rybinski struck was directed next door, 3612 Guthrie Street, to call for help," the Gary American story reports.
“Mrs. Katy Mason, who operates a beauty shop at that address, immediately called the police headquarters and informed them of the location and urgency of the accident.
“The intersection of Guthrie and Catalpa Streets is in a section of town which is heavily populated by colored people.
“‘Just a moment,’ the desk man answered Mrs. Mason, ‘I’ll give you the sergeant.’ She repeated the facts to the sergeant on duty.
“‘Is the man white or colored?’ the sergeant inquired bluntly.
“‘What difference does that make, he’s lying on the wet pavement, probably dying,’ Mrs. Mason snapped and hung up the receiver.
“Several minutes later a patrol wagon drew up alongside the knot of spectators who stood about the injured man debating whether to risk their own unskilled efforts to aid him or await professional attendants.
“’The patrol wagon driver shouldered through them, glanced briefly at the victim, and satisfied that the inert figure was not a Negro’s, inquired for the nearest available phone.
“‘They sent me,’ he remarked casually to the spectators, most of whom were colored, ‘to find out whether or not he’s a white man.’
“Then he went to the beauty shop phone and called for an ambulance to take the injured man to the hospital.”
Rybinski lay in the street “for more than 20 minutes after the accident was first reported by telephone.” When the ambulance arrived, he was “conveyed to St. Catherine’s Hospital and admitted at 5:35 p.m. He died at 10:40 p.m.”
The Gary American’s story concludes: “Paul Rybinski, age 57, is survived by his widow, and two daughters and a son.”
 



Members of the U.S. Supreme Court come and go, but the Court itself never changes in its undying opposition to equality for the Negro people. This came out once again on Jan. 12 when the Court said segregation is OK.
Two years ago Miss Ada Lois Sipuel applied for admission to the University of Oklahoma Law School, the only school of its kind in that state. She was turned down solely because she is a Negro and Oklahoma segregates Negroes in education as well as other fields. The state courts ruled against her, and so she went to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking two things – that she be admitted to the school, and that the Court outlaw segregation of students as unconstitutional.
By unanimous vote, the Court did neither. It ordered Oklahoma to provide a legal education for Miss Sipuel – either at the existing school, from which Negroes have been banned, or by setting up a new school for Negroes only. And it refused to take any action at all on the constitutionality of segregation.
Of the two questions, the second is, of course, far more important because it affects all aspects of Negro life in the 20 states and the District of Columbia where local laws specifically require segregation.
By upholding these laws in the Sipuel case, the Court is acting consistently with its own long anti-Negro history and traditions. In fact, this body bears greater responsibility for the pattern of the present Jim Crow system than any other single institution in the country.
After the Civil War Congress passed several laws to protect the civil rights of the newly freed Negroes. But the Supreme Court threw most of them out, ruling that authority over the protection of civil rights belongs to the states, and not to the federal government. This was just what the Southern states wanted, and they quickly passed Jim Crow laws to deprive Negroes of their rights. The Supreme Court said discrimination was illegal, but it nullified the effect of that decision by declaring segregation is not discrimination if “separate but equal” facilities are provided for those segregated.
“Examples of how the rule works are readily at hand,” says William R. Ming, Jr., in the chapter he wrote for the NAACP’c recent appeal to the United Nations. “Contrast the crowded, dirty, freezing in winter, and sweltering in summer, ‘Jim Crow’ cars of the southern railroads with the accommodations afforded white persons paying no more than equal fares. Or, consider the one-room schools, often unheated, poorly furnished and frequently equally poorly taught, to which most rural Negroes go for their education as another illustration ... Or, wait with a Negro soldier on a three day pass while successive busses admit only a few Negroes at a time as his leave runs out. The fact is that the law permits facilities to be separate but it does not succeed in making them equal.”
You can say that again. And while you’re saying it, remember what it means: To win equality for the Negro people it is necessary to change not only the laws, but the whole system which makes such laws possible and inevitable.
 



Both in the labor movement and in top capitalist circles there is a great deal of speculation over the question: Will Wallace stick to his third party candidacy for president, or will he throw in the towel after the Republican and Democratic conventions in June?
In a press conference on the same day that he announced his candidacy, Wallace said he would withdraw “should either of the major parties become definitely a peace party before the election.” Under this formula, Wallace leaves the door wide open. As Arthur Krock points out in the Jan. 4 N.Y. Times:
“Since he reserves to himself the right to conclude whether or not the Republicans or the Democrats have become the ‘peace party,’ he can base withdrawal on conviction or expediency, and expedient decisions occur frequently in his public record. A few words in either party platform, or any differences on foreign policy between the Republican candidate for President and Mr. Truman, can easily serve him as a bridge after the major national conventions are held ...
“He could then, reverting to a very recent position, announce that his immediate purpose had been served and that an independent candidacy this year could not further advance it.”
Krock, who is an opponent of Wallace, expresses the belief that Wallace probably “will not finish the race.” This opinion is apparently shared by some of Wallace’s followers.
At the Albany meeting of the New York State CIO Executive Board on Jan. 5, which voted against the, endorsement of Wallace, the Times reports:
“On both sides [of the dispute over Wallace] considerable skepticism was expressed about whether Mr. Wallace would actually run. Several left-wingers [Wallace supporters] said his primary aim was to. increase the ‘bargaining power’ of those opposed to the policies of the Truman Administration and the Republican Party.”
Not having inside information about Wallace’s intentions, we cannot predict with any certainty what his course will be. From what we know of Wallace, we would say that he is not sure himself.
But what is most significant about this question right now is the light it throws on the irresponsible and undemocratic nature of the Wallace movement. Wallace says yes, and there is a third party campaign. Wallace says no, and the whole third party campaign blows up. The rank and file have nothing to say, one way or another. Wallace’s one-man veto power, creating the possibility of a betrayal of his followers’ aspirations, is one of the most objectionable features of his movement.
This illumines the deep-going differences between a Labor Party and the movement Wallace is attempting to build. A Labor Party, based on the unions, would be responsible to duly elected bodies representing its membership. The members could participate in shaping policies, selecting officers and naming candidates.
The Wallace movement, in contrast, is being constructed on the fuehrer principle. Wallace loftily invites his supporters to send him suggestions and proposals – but they have no voice in making decisions.
The workers, who have fought so militantly to establish democratic processes and rank and file control in the modern mass production unions, will want at least as much democracy in the party they propose to build. That is why they will reject all one-man leader organizations and build on the tested foundations of democracy and control from the ranks.
 



The prestige of Henry Wallace among the Negro people is greater today than of any prominent politician in the country. If present indications mean anything, he will draw a very large Negro vote in 1948; perhaps even a majority of the Negro vote.
The reason, of course, is that Wallace is the only capitalist politician who has taken a forthright position against Jim Crow and who has even staged some demonstrations against segregation at public meetings in the South. If Negroes vote for Wallace it will be because they conceive such a vote to be a protest against the system of race prejudice and all its evils.
Nevertheless, we want to sound a warning to all militant Negroes: Be careful! Don’t accept any counterfeit! Look this piece of merchandise over very closely before you buy it!
Remember this: Words are cheap, especially for capitalist politicians. Don’t judge a man or a party only by what they say, but also by what they do; and not merely by what they say and do today, but by what they said and did in the past.
The first point to remember is that Wallace’s friendship for the Negro struggle is of very recent origin. In fact, most of it, suspiciously enough, dates from the time he decided to break with Truman in 1946 and began to eye the presidential nomination.
But Wallace was in politics a long time before that. For something like 14 years before that he was one of the leaders of the Democratic Party, and he never had much to say against the Jim Crow system in those days; as a matter of fact, he and Roosevelt supported and got support from the rabidly Jim Crow Southern Democrats.
As a Cabinet officer he never lifted a finger to end discrimination against Negro federal employees. As Secretary of Agriculture his politics favored the big landholders in the South and did nothing to help the poverty-stricken Negro and white sharecroppers. As Secretary of Commerce he never put up any kind of real fight for the FEPC or against job discrimination in industry.
But the best example of the suspicious contrast between his past record and his present pronouncements is the stand he took during the war. Today, of course, he poses as an intrepid anti-war fighter, while a few years ago he was one of the biggest apologists and advocates of war. Now the questions we want to raise for consideration are these: Does any one remember Henry Wallace ever saying anything against Army Jim Crow and segregation during that whole war? Or doing anything against them?
How much reliance can you place in a man who kept his mouth shut in time of war, when it counted the most and when the Negro people were engaged in bitter struggles to win equality in the armed forces?
Just this brief look at the Wallace record is enough to show that you can’t properly judge a man by what he says when he is running for office. But there is another and equally important aspect to the Wallace problem – the question of his program on Jim Crow – and that we will discuss next week.
 



The liberals howled in anguish when President Truman broke his promise to them and refused to reappoint James M. Landis, an early New Dealer, as chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board. Landis, it was announced, would be replaced by a Wall Street investment banker.
Senator Glen Taylor was so upset that he tore up a statement for the press announcing his decision “not to run for vice-president in Wallace’s third party, Max Lerner of PM whined that Truman’s dismissal of Landis “because the big airline corporations didn’t like him” was another example of how “Truman still falls down, judged by really exacting standards of a fighting liberalism.” (But evidently not far enough down for PM to quit supporting him for re-election.)
The reaction was so unfavorable that Truman decided not to appoint a banker to the job after all. Since all of Truman’s major appointees are either bankers or generals, this left him only one way out. So he appointed a general – Maj. Gen, Laurence S. Kuter.
Henry Wallace was quick to take a crack at this action: “For 15 months I have been pointing out that the president has been handing over control of the administration to Wall Street and military men. It is reported there are now more than 170 former army and navy officers in top civilian posts. It’s hard to keep tally on the investment bankers.” (Of course, the process actually began long before 15 months ago: to be more exact, it began to assume its present huge proportions under Roosevelt).
While it is hard to keep tally on the growing number of generals and bankers taking over in Washington, it’s not hard to see what the effects are. Take the example of General of the Army Marshall, who is hailed as “Man of the Year” by Time magazine. Marshall can hardly conceal his contempt for civilians, including the members of Congress whose servant he is supposed to be.
At the Senate committee hearing on the Marshall Plan on Jan. 8, Marshall laid down the law: “Either undertake to meet the requirements of the problems or don’t undertake it at all.” Meaning: You Senators had better do what I say and grant as much money as I demand – or else. It wasn’t until a day later that George of Georgia got up the nerve to take the floor and describe this insolent ultimatum as “a propaganda method,” although, he hastened to add, “General Marshall may not have meant it that way.” Even this feeble protest was regarded as “a verbal bombshell” in the Senate.
If Senator George doesn’t watch out, he’s liable to go down into the brass hats’ blackbook as a “troublemaker.” They don’t like to be questioned too much, or to be contradicted. Things just aren’t done that way in the armed forces, and their conception of the brave new world is a great big barracks, with the people lined up at attention, waiting for orders.
But Tris Coffin, Washington columnist, on Jan. 10 printed an even better illustration of what the prussianization of the government adds up to:
“A group of the (State) Department’s experts were briefing Secretary of State Marshall on some intricate problem. The Secretary was completely absorbed and occasionally broke in to ask sharp, penetrating questions. One such inquiry was a question of policy. There was a respectful silence among the higher-ups around the Secretary. But one of the younger men, an expert in a specialized field, spoke up brashly, ‘Mr. Secretary, I think ...’ That’s as far as he got. Marshall turned a Cold, fishy glare on him and asked, ‘What is your salary?’ ‘Seven thousand dollars a year, sir.’ The Secretary said abruptly, ‘At that salary, you are riot paid to think.’ ”
By the way, what’s your salary?
 



Mrs. Rosa Lee Ingram and her two young children are Georgia sharecroppers who have been sentenced to the electric chair because they defended them selves against a murderous attack. The blood-stained system, oppressing the Negro people has marked them down as its next victims and can be expected to fight to the last ditch to see that they do not get away.
Read the article about the Ingram family on Page 1 of this issue, and you will have. most of the essential information about the case. Then ask yourself these questions:
Suppose the Ingrams had been white and the dead man had been a Negro – do you think the Georgia sheriff would have arrested the Ingrams? Do you think they would have been thrown into jail and denied the services of a lawyer until the day of their so-called trial? Do you think there would have even been a trial, or that anybody outside of Georgia would ever have heard about the case?
The answer to all these questions is, of course, No. There never would have been any arrests, there would have been no trial and no conviction, and the whole thing would have been written off as a case of self-defense. But everything happens differently in the South when a Negro is accused.
Why? Are the rulers of Georgia and their servants on the judge’s bench and in the sheriff’s office afraid of Mrs. Ingram? Do they think that this poverty-stricken widow is going to threaten their power if she is set free? Of course not. They know very well that if she is let alone, they will never see her again.
Nevertheless, they want her blood, because they regard her as a symbol. She and her sons dared to lift their hands in self-defense, they committed the unpardonable sin of fighting back when they were assaulted by a white man. The rulers of Georgia want to burn the Ingrams to death in order to “teach a lesson” to the Negro people as a whole, to terrorize them so that they will be afraid to resist, so that they will “stay in their place,” so that they will never on any occasion attempt to fight for their rights – whether in a dispute on a farm, or in a controversy over wages, or in a struggle at the ballot.
And that is why the Ingram case has an importance even greater than the ordinary individual instance of tragic injustice. Mrs. Ingram and her sons are a symbol to us too – to all of us who want to smash the oppressive Jim Crow system. That’s why we have a double reason for snatching them out of the hands of their would-be executioners – first of all, because they’re not guilty, and secondly, because saving them will help to undermine Jim Crow rule. Do everything you can to stop these murders!
 



A note of uneasiness mixed with crankiness was evident in the Communist Party press after Henry Wallace and Glen Taylor issued their statements on this recent Stalinist coup in Czechoslovakia. Wallace and Taylor Didn’t Think It Through, complains Joseph Starobin in the March 1 Daily Worker, chiding Taylor because he said. “I imagine it was the result of pressure by the Russians.” Wallace said the Czech events were “unfortunate” and could have been prevented by a different U.S. foreign policy. Milton Howard, in the March 7 Worker, keeps asking him how was it unfortunate, doesn’t he realize it was the best possible thing that could have happened under the circumstances?
The Stalinists are of course still whooping it up for Wallace and Taylor, because after all they did try to condone the Stalinist coup. But even this little incident relating to foreign policy indicates that the CP attachment for its beloved “progressive standard bearers” is not going to be a wholly idyllic love affair, and that it is not likely to be any more permanent than their previous entanglements with Roosevelt and Truman.
This incident dealt with foreign policy, where the Stalinists felt they had to demur publicly. But there was another incident around the same time, relating more to domestic policy, and although I searched the Daily Worker very carefully for several days thereafter, they never had a word to say on it. It’s worth discussing.
On Feb. 29 Taylor spoke over the radio in New York City and said: “I’m against Communists occupying positions in government where they might possibly turn secret information over to the Russians after what happened in Canada.”. But, he added, “it is a different thing to kick them out of the Labor Department. They can be as good public servants there as anybody.”
That certainly throws a new light on the whole question of the “red purge” which the administration has been carrying on for more than a year. Moreover, it shows what a tremendous distinction there is between a reactionary like Truman and a “shining young knight” from the West like Taylor.
Truman, you see, wants to drive the Stalinists out of any and every government job there is. That makes him a witch hunter. Taylor thinks Truman is going too. far. He thinks it’s OK to purge them out of some government jobs – say, in the State Department. But he thinks it would be smart to employ them in less important jobs, such as in the Labor Department, where they could be useful in compiling statistics and in persuading unions not to go on strike. That makes Taylor a liberal, first class.
Do you see the fundamental difference? If you do, maybe you’ll want to join with the members of the Communist Party in supporting the Wallace-Taylor ticket, ring doorbells for them, get petitions signed for them, donate money so that they can spread more such “progressive propagandas” etc. If you do, here are a couple of slogans you may find useful: “Vote for Wallace and Taylor – They Stand For Only a 50% Purge.” “Civil Liberties Must Be Maintained – In the Labor Department.”
 



One reason why Henry Wallace will get a big vote next November is that he is telling the people a considerable number of truths and half-truths, especially about the responsibility of the Democrats and Republicans for the growing war danger. But at the same time he is propagating one of the most insidious lies of all – the illusion that it is possible for a party like his own to prevent imperialist war.
While Wallace is at his weakest (and most uncomfortable) when he trie’s to explain or justify the Stalinist policy in Europe, he is on his strongest ground politically when he attacks the bi-partisan war policy and manufacture of war hysteria. A good example was his radio speech answering Truman’s demand on March 17 for the resumption of the draft and the passage of UMT.
“America’s mothers and sons ... rightfully believe that a draft and compulsory military training are not the way to preserve freedom at home or to guarantee democracy abroad ... The program to militarize America, if carried out, will impose a police state.”
These are the things a worried people want to hear, the things they know to be true. Wallace also gives them the following explanation of why this situation exists:
“We have reached this state because the men who are running our government fear the power of the common men and women the world over ... We have come to this world crisis because willful men with private interests are dictating our foreign policy. Their interest is profit, not people. They seek to protect and extend their foreign investments against the democratic actions of people abroad.”
That is an example of the half-truths spread by Wallace. It is correct so far as it goes. Properly understood and applied, it has a place within the scientific explanation of why the U.S. is being driven down the road to war. But because it is only a part of the broader explanation, it can and does lead to all kinds of false conclusions when it is presented as the basic reason.
 
Only Part of Cause
To understand this problem, it is necessary to begin by recognizing that war is an inevitable product of the capitalist system in its present monopoly stage. No big capitalist power can prosper within its own borders atone; it must expand or suffer paralyzing economic crisis; to survive, it must get new markets abroad, new sources of raw materials, new fields of investment, new spheres of influence. When it is blocked from securing or consolidating these objectives by the economic or political power of other nations, it resorts to military means.
It is not enough, therefore, to point an accusing finger at the greedy and evil men who are running the government today. Their individual avarice and lust for power are important factors in the situation, but not the decisive ones. In the first place, they are not acting on their own; they are the representatives and administrators of their class, the capitalist class. Without the consent of their class they would never dare embark on such a dangerous venture as war.
 
System Drives Them
In the second place, they are driven to desperate measures for resolving international disputes not merely by some quirk in their individual or collective minds or hearts, but by the very needs of the capitalist system itself. War represents a terrible risk for them, but an even more terrible prospect is the collapse of capitalism in Europe. Because of the very nature of the system, American capitalism could not long survive in an anti-capitalist world.
Within this framework, the Wallace statement quoted above has full validity. But separated from it, it becomes a snare, having meaning only as a “devil” theory on the cause of imperialist war. Used as Wallace uses it, it means wars are caused by “bad men.” And the obvious corollary is: Get rid of the bad men, put in good men. and then we won’t have to worry about war any more.
The main thing to remember about Wallace’s position on war is its denial that war is an inseparable feature of capitalism. Being a devoted defender of capitalism, he holds, on the contrary, that peace is possible under capitalism. Put in good men, reform or patch up the system, show the ruling class how much it stands to lose by going to war, build up some mechanism like the United Nations and – according to Wallace – you can have everlasting peace.
Wallace tried in his radio address to show how “reasonable” this position is:
“Shall we fight Russia because we are competing for the raw materials of the world? We shall dissipate more raw materials in such a war than they are worth to either the United States or Russia. There is no competition or raw materials which cannot be settled by peaceful means.”
In a rational world order there would of course be no war over raw materials, which would be accessible to all and collectively used for the common welfare. But a world dominated by capitalism is not a rational world. It’s a world whose very fate is based on such conflicts as the competition for raw materials.
This competition is costly and in the long run undermines the system it seeks to maintain – but that fact never prevented imperialist and commercial wars before, and it has no more effect on Wall Street today than it had on Hitler ten years ago. “Reasonable” arguments of this kind are shrugged off by the imperialists – like rain off a duck’s back – because it’s a dog-eat-dog system, where each dog is ready to undergo some suffering himself in order to remain or become the top dog, and where all the dogs are indifferent to the welfare of doghood as a whole.
 
Competition Breeds War
Moreover, Wallace’s contention that there is no competition which cannot be settled by peaceful means flies in the face of all capitalist history. Tragic experience has shown us too often that under imperialism, competition always leads to economic warfare, the precursor of military explosions. Was World War I just an- accident, due to unreasonableness? Was World War II a fluke that could have been prevented by an amicable conference to settle competition in a friendly kind of way? To imply that is to mock at the lessons of history and thereby to prevent the kind of understanding of modern world conflicts that alone can lead to peace.
History has also taught us to be on guard against capitalist reformism and pacifism. Wallace is not the first of his kind. There was Wilson before him, who was going to reform capitalism and keep us out of war, and Roosevelt after that, who sang the same sweet song. They, too, were “reasonable” men but in the end their reputation as men of peace served only to facilitate their efforts to drag the country into war.
There is no need here to enter into the question of Wallace’s sincerity – although it should never be forgotten that he was against World War II before it started and then became its busiest apologist once the guns began to boom. What counts in these big questions is program. And Wallace’s program for preventing war can have no different outcome than Wilson’s or Roosevelt’s or that of the pre-World War II isolationists.
 
Get Rid of Cause
Fundamentally, the reason is that you can’t end war without ending its cause, capitalism. No matter how fine his intentions may be, a man who clings to this decaying system can’t help misleading his followers who want to fight against war. As long as his influence is able to dissuade the people from replacing capitalism with a socialist system, just so long will the prospect of war be with us.
Many workers intend to vote for Wallace because he, like them, expresses opposition to the war now being prepared. But it is necessary, precisely in the interests of preventing that war, to warn them most insistently that no party dedicated to the maintenance of capitalism can prevent war. The exposure of Wallace’s big lie, the destruction of all pacifist illusions about his party being able to stop the war drive – these are important tasks in today’s struggle for a new socialist society, where war will be a horrible memory rather than an ever-present threat.
 



The Democratic Party today is like a ship in a storm that has already sprung one bad leak, is on the verge of springing others and never wilt be the same, even if it should succeed in reaching port. In fact, we may be witnessing the beginning of the end of its power as a major national party.
This capitalist party has suffered from internal dissension, conflicts and crises since at least, the end of the Civil War. That is natural, because it has appealed to and won the support of diverse and even antagonistic groups. But never before in its modern history has it been hit simultaneously by serious disaffection from its extreme tendencies on both sides.
One section has already split off from the party, and only a rash man would predict that this will be the last such split. Henry Wallace may return to the party in the future, despite his denials about the possibility of such a move this year, but for the time being he has taken a sizable chunk of the Democratic vote with him.
 
Differs on Foreign Policy
Wallace’s main differences with Truman are over tactics on foreign policy, but he is also able to exploit the mass discontent with the administration’s domestic policy. The effectiveness of his demagogy on these issues was made evident in the Bronx congressional election last month, when Boss Flynn’s machine worked hard to bring out the registered Democrats, only to have a great number of them vote for the Wallace-endorsed candidate.
The Wallace strength is enough to damage Truman’s chances beyond repair in several important states, if not in most of them. To counteract this, Truman has had to start waving the New Deal flag again in order to try to hold on to the labor vote, and to issue a mild “civil rights program,” going beyond any of Roosevelt’s promises in this sphere, in order to win the allegiance of the Negro vote in the North.
Instead of helping, this has produced a new crack in the party structure, and now the Southern Bourbons, poll taxers arid cracker politicians are staging a revolt of their own.
This isn’t the first time. Some of them tried the same thing in the latter years of the Roosevelt regime. But it wasn’t so serious a matter for the party then as it is now.
First of all, the Southern Democrats knew they needed Roosevelt to win national elections for them and were fairly sure that he could do so. Secondly, the Democrats at that time controlled not only the White House but also Congress, and a serious split would have cost the Southern Democrats a good deal of the power and patronage accruing to them from the important committee chairmanships they held as a result of seniority and the undemocratic electoral practices of the South.
 
Little Confidence in Truman
Today, the Southern Democrats have little confidence in the ability of Truman to lead their party to victory in Congress. Furthermore, the Republican congressional victory of 1946 made the Democrats a minority, and they consequently feel that they don’t stand to lose as much through a possible party split as they would have under Roosevelt.
Even more important, they bitterly resent the “civil rights program,” passage of which might set into motion mass forces in the South that could unseat them for good. They realize that Truman, deep down in his heart, is no more a friend of the Negro people than they are. But they know he is in a tough situation, requiring him to pay lip service to the Negroes’ demands and to sign such legislation as the anti-poll tax and anti-lynching bills if the Southern Democrats cannot prevent their passage in Congress.
Under the circumstances, the Southern Democrats appear willing to gamble on sacrificing the national interests of their party rather than to permit any changes in the Southern status quo. Besides, they have learned from experience that they can get along on most issues with the Republican Party as well as they can with their own Northern comrades.
 
Southern Democrats Determined
Already they are taking steps to strengthen their hand in this intra-party fight, even to the point of preparing local measures to withhold part of the Southern electoral votes from Truman. This may be only a bluff but it is a sign that the Southern Democrats have taken the offensive and are engaged in a cold war with the administration. They appear determined now not merely to regain their former dominant position in the party. but if possible to take it over altogether, as their forefathers, the slaveholding aristocracy, did before the Civil War.
A compromise is still possible, of course, but that might ruin the Democratic Party in the North just as effectively as would a split in the South.
These troubles have produced a growing coolness to Truman’s candidacy in recent weeks. Numerous Southern party leaders have laid down the ultimatum that Truman must go. At the same time the labor leaders and liberals of the Americans for Democratic Action stripe have refused thus far to come out openly for Truman.
 
Possibility of Eisenhower
Serious attention is being given to the possibility of persuading Eisenhower to accept a Democratic draft on the theory that he won’t antagonize anyone because no one knows what his position is and in the belief that his candidacy might also heal the breach with Wallace, who is known to have a high regard for this particular brass hat.
The situation had become so alarming by last week that Truman, immediately after returning from his Caribbean jaunt, felt it necessary to change his strategy and try to head off a possible Eisenhower boom by proclaiming his own candidacy. But this move did nothing to solve the dilemma tormenting Truman and the Democratic high command – how to successfully woo the labor and minority vote in the North without further antagonizing the Southern Democrats.
What keeps the Democratic ship afloat? It’s true that it still commands the support of the local machine bosses like Flynn. Hague, Kelly, etc. But their power is not what it used to be if the Bronx election is any kind of index, and the party would sink like a rock if that was all it had to depend on.
More important than the local machine bosses – are the leaders of the AFL, CIO and Railroad Brotherhoods. Ordinarily not distinguished by over-activity in any field, today they are bailing away like mad to keep this capitalist craft from going under. To tell the plain truth, if it wasn’t for the hope that the Murrays, Greens and Whitneys can pull it through, the Democratic Party might very well disintegrate by the end of this year.
It would be hard to imagine a more contemptible spectacle. Here is a party that has been swindling and oppressing the American people for decades, a collection of corrupt machine bosses and Southern Bourbons whose only devotion is to Big Business, a gang which is just as responsible as the Republican Party for the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, to mention only recent history.
Here it is in its worst straits, ready for well-deserved oblivion, on the verge of a collapse that would necessarily make it easier for the workers and poor farmers and minorities to construct a party that would really represent their interests.
 
Bureaucrats to the Rescue
And at this point – when a really golden opportunity exists to end this monstrosity forever with a minimum of effort – the labor bureaucrats come rushing to its aid like the U.S. Cavalry in the movies, flinging the workers’ money around in a desperate attempt to save it and reserving its most vicious attacks for those who want to desert it. That’s what is known as “labor statesmanship.”
Some of the labor leaders, more aware than others of the deep-going rank and file dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party; try to present this policy in a more “radical” cloak. A good example was the resolution adopted March 3 by the International Executive Board of the CIO United Auto Workers at a meeting in Chicago.
The Board voted to support the national CIO policy in rejecting Wallace’s third party “as a political maneuver contrary to the best interests of labor and the nation and as an obstacle in the way of the establishment of a successful and genuine progressive political party in the U.S.A.,” which the UAW leaders are presumably willing to help build some time after the 1948 elections.
Whom do they think they are going to kid with this kind of stuff? Instead of finishing off the Democratic Party when it is in a bad way, first they propose to rehabilitate it by striving to give it a victory in November, and then after it is strengthened, they are going to try to replace it with another new party sometime in the distant future. That’s what passes for “practical politics” in the more “progressive” circles of the labor bureaucracy.
The real duty of all genuine labor fighters is not to prop up the Democratic Party in the period of its collapse, but to utilize this very collapse to launch an independent Labor Party which could emerge at once as a major party on the American political scene.
 



Although it is now two months since the publication of Oliver C. Cox’s book – Caste, Class and Race (Doubleday and Co., $7.50) – very little attention has been given to this scholarly work by the capitalist press. This annoys us because in our opinion it is the most important book published in this country since the war and by far the best ever written by an American on the question of race prejudice.
It is interesting to contrast this with the big build-up a few years ago for a book that really isn’t in the same class – Myrdal’s An American Dilemma. Of course, you don’t have to search far to learn the reason for the different receptions given these books. Myrdal’s represents an apology for the status quo, implying that race prejudice presents a problem that only time can solve. On the other hand, Cox’s book, despite certain defects, leads to profoundly revolutionary conclusions, showing that Negro oppression is product of capitalism and can be ended by socialism.
Perhaps we can indicate the value of this book by referring to the section analyzing the theories of the conservative, orthodox and non-revolutionary schools of thought on race relations in the U.S. Among those dealt with are:
The Theory that race prejudice is due to some fundamental color antipathy between the races. The theory that it is due to “custom” or the “irrational upthrust of primitive folk attitudes.” The theory that it can be explained by “ethnocentrism,” that is, “the view of things in which one’s own group, is the center of everything, and all others are scaled and rated in reference to it.” The theory of race prejudice as a “belief” without regard for the “materialistic” source of the rationalization.”
After presenting these and other theories objectively, the author subjects them to historical and materialistic tests, exposing all their contradictions, shortcomings, reactionary implications and scientific worthlessness. On the contrary, he shows, “the race problem developed out of the need of the planter class, the ruling class, to keep the freed Negro exploitable. To do this, the ruling class had to do what every ruling class must do; that is, develop mass support for its policy. Race prejudice was and is the convenient vehicle.”
Then there is the large school of writers relying on the theory of the caste system as their guide to the study of race relations in the U.S. Actually, as Dr. Cox demonstrates on the basis of a detailed examination of the caste system in India, this analogy has no basis whatever, either historically or sociologically. It falsely assumes that each of the races isolates itself, thus denying the aspirations of the Negroes for equality of social opportunity, and implying at best that segregation is the real solution.
Dr. Cox also deals effectively with the Myrdal book, which presents a variation of the caste theory. Myrdal’s approach is shown to be based on a misrepresentation of the problem as a “moral issue,” void of all class analysis, and as a “mistaken” or “wicked” idea shared by all the whites equally, and thus in effect exonerating the ruling class from its responsibility for instigating and promoting race prejudice.
Finally, for the benefit of those who think the answer lies in “education,” we present this quotation from Dr. Cox:
“We cannot defeat race prejudice by proving that it is wrong. The reason for this is that race prejudice is only a symptom of a materialistic social fact. If, for instance, we should discover by ‘scientific’ method that Negroes and Chinese are ‘superior’ to tall, long-skulled blonds ... then, to the powers that be, so much the worse for Negroes and Chinese. Our proof accomplishes nothing. The articulate white man’s ideas about his racial superiority are rooted deeply in the social system, and it can be corrected only by changing the system itself.”
 



A very important book was published a few weeks ago – Caste, Class and Race by Oliver Cromwell Cox, professor of sociology and economics at Tuskegee Institute (Doubleday and Co.). It is a long book, covering a number of vital and complex problems, and some of the points Dr. Cox tries to make are not acceptable to Marxists. In this column, however, we intend to leave aside such disputed questions and to concentrate on the third and largest section of the book, dealing with the field of race relations.
The price of the book is high ($7.50) and that, unfortunately, will limit its circulation. But it is well worth it and it fully merits study by every opponent of the Jim Crow system, as we shall try to show here by referring to one chapter: Race Relations – Its Meaning, Beginning and Progress.
What is the origin of race prejudice? Dr. Cox’s “hypothesis is that racial exploitation and race prejudice developed among Europeans with the rise of capitalism and nationalism, and that because of the worldwide ramifications of capitalism, all racial antagonisms can be traced to the policies and attitudes of the leading capitalist people, the white people of Europe and North America.” And he does a brilliant job in supporting this hypothesis.
First he goes back to the history of the early empires, touching on the Greek and Roman especially, to show that race prejudice was unknown then, even though colored peoples were among those subjugated. Similarly with such later developments as the Crusades.
In the 15th century the Portugese, seeking a route to the trade in the Near East, began to invade Africa and enslave the natives. But “there was as yet no belief in any cultural incapacity of these colored peoples. Their conversion to Christianity was sought with enthusiasm, and this transformation was supposed to make the Africans the human equals of all other Christians.” When converted, the Africans could be and were assimilated.
In other words, it was not until about the time America was discovered and capitalism first began to develop that racial antagonism appeared.
“The slave trade was simply a way of recruiting labor for the purpose of exploiting the great natural resources of America. This trade did not develop because Indians and Negroes were red and black, or because they cranial capacity averaged a certain number of cubic centimeters; but simply because they were the best workers to be found for the heavy labor in the mines and plantations across the Atlantic. If white workers were available in sufficient numbers they would have been substituted.”
The forerunners of the present capitalist class needed a new ideology or theory to “justify” the degradation produced by the profitable slave trade and slavery, so they invented one – the theory of “white superiority.” But that was not until the middle of the 16th century. The argument that race prejudice is “inherent” in mankind is thoroughly disproved by all the facts of history. It was invented and developed during the last 400 years in order to make profits for the ruling class. As Dr. Cox puts it:
“It is probable that without capitalism ... the world might never have experienced race prejudice. Indeed, we should expect that under another form of economic organization, say socialism, the relationship between whites and peoples of color would be significantly modified.”
The above summary gives only the faintest hint of the riches to be found in this book. We shall return again and again to a discussion of it. Our necessarily brief remarks here are intended only to call the attention of our readers to a work that deserves the widest possible circulation.
 



“I don’t want to hurt your feelings, young man,” stated
A.N. Kemp, president of American Airlines, “but I don’t believe that
Negroes will be used as pilots in the immediate world of post-war
aviation.” He said it in an interview in New York printed in the Pittsburgh
Courier, March 27, 1943.
The airline executive went on to explain that “of course” he
personally had nothing against Negroes and had even hired some to work
in his ground crews, but that his company would lose money if it hired
Negro pilots; and presumably to show that his outlook was not limited
by considerations of profits alone, he added that “the Negro would have
to become more cultured before he could expect to enjoy the fullness of
American life.”
He spoke pleasantly, politely, his tone was friendly, but in his
words there was no hint of doubt or hesitation: he was speaking with
the voice of the whole capitalist class and frankly stating its
intention of maintaining in the post-war world the rotten pattern of
Jim Crow discrimination, segregation and insult which dominated this
country before Pearl Harbor and the proclamation of the “four
freedoms.” There are some people who harbor illusions about the
character of the Negro’s status after the termination of the second
“war for democracy,” but if they do, it is not the fault of Kemp and
his fellow capitalists and the government, whose words and deeds speak
loudly and plainly enough.
A. Philip Randolph, AFL union leader and national director of the
March-On-Washington Movement, has proposed that
“... there ought to be and must be a movement known
as the Free Negro, which will send a strong delegation of Negroes and
their true friends to the Peace Conference at the end of this war to
present the claims of Negro people in America, the British West Indies
and Africa.”
One would be justified in concluding from this that
Randolph believes the post-war status of the Negro will be decided at a
peace conference of the victorious United Nations. To a certain extent
this is correct. But to a far greater extent the Negro’s fate is being
determined right now, in the midst of the war. What happens at a peace
conference will depend not only on the relationship of forces between
the various countries, but even more on the relationship of class
forces within each country. The character of the peace conference will
have been decided more or less conclusively by what happened during the
war, just as the nature of the war and what happens during it flow from
the developments and struggles leading up to the war.
The Negro’s greatest opportunity for advancing toward full equality
is now, as his enemies well recognize, and if the Negro does not take
advantage of this opportunity now he will find it much harder to make
progress after the war, when his enemies will have disposed of their
foreign rivals and will be able to devote their energy and attention
toward keeping the Negro “in his place.”
It is necessary to make this point and to drive it home again and
again because there are so many people trying to obscure it. These
people — the modern Uncle Toms, in whose ranks the Stalinists must be
included — never miss an opportunity to explain how much progress is
being made. They loudly tell you how many more one-tenths of one per
cent schools there are for Negroes today than there were before; they
cite figures to show that Negro birth mortality rates have fallen by so
much or that Negro preachers and lawyers have increased in number by
that much. Needless to say, they attribute all this progress to the
superior qualities of their own programs. Nor are middle class Negroes
and Stalinists the only people addicted to the pastime of
progress-shouting. Government bureaus and the capitalist press have
been going in for it quite heavily since Pearl Harbor. Indeed, you
might say of the capitalist press articles and reports on the Negroes
that they devote two-thirds of their space to inflammatory and most
often distorted accounts of crimes by Negroes and one-third to accounts
of the remarkable extent of Negro progress.
The purpose behind this pointing-with-pride and
viewing-with-pleasure is obvious. The Negro people instinctively want
to take advantage of the present crisis to achieve the rights which
have been denied them. This can be confirmed by any honest person
acquainted with Negro thought today. It is hard to convince the Negro
masses that this is a war for democracy when they are denied the most
elementary democratic rights. [1]
The progress-shouters seek, so to speak, to change the subject, to
convince the Negroes that even though things aren’t perfect, they are
getting better day by day and will eventually work out all right. Their
purpose is to persuade the masses not to conduct militant struggle
against Jim Crow. If they are successful, the Negro people will miss
the present opportunity to improve their status with the result that
they might be condemned to second-class citizenship for decades to come.
It is not our intention here to argue that the Negro’s conditions
have not changed at all, nor to overlook whatever genuine progress that
has been made. No one can dispute, for example, the fact that Negro
unemployment today is much lower than before the war, or that many
Negroes have won genuine equality on their jobs as the result of trade
union efforts. What we propose to do here is to look at the whole
picture, to examine the true character of the gains that have been made
since Pearl Harbor, to list the losses and the setbacks that have been
encountered while these gains were being made, to show what was
temporary and secondary and what was permanent about these gains and
losses. It is necessary for militant Negroes to ponder these questions,
for World War II will not last forever and they have lives to live
after it comes to an end. They must understand the developments of the
first 18 months of American participation in the war, for the post-war
pattern is foreshadowed in these developments.
First, the question of employment, which strikes so directly at the
economic conditions of the Negro masses that there is quite often a
tendency to subordinate all other questions to this one. There are many
estimates of the number of Negro workers employed in war plants, the
highest being a half million. This figure includes both those working
on machines and janitors, porters, etc. All others listed as gainfully
employed are either in non-war industries and occupations, including
domestic service, on the farms, or in the armed forces. The total in
the armed forces is already over a half million and is expected to
increase to a million by the end of 1943. Newly-adopted legislation,
embodied in House Joint Resolution 96, which was passed by both houses
of Congress and signed by the president over the protests of many labor
and farm organizations, who charge the bill with restoring “virtual
peonage,” in effect ties the Southern Negro farmers and sharecroppers
to the land for the duration of the war. It gives county agents
notoriously staunch upholders of “white supremacy,” the power to deny
Negroes the right to leave their home county for such purposes as going
North to work in war industries.
Meanwhile, in the face of the most severe manpower shortage in the
nation’s history and in the eighteenth month of the war, there is still
a comparatively large body of able-bodied Negroes, estimated from
600,000 to 1,000,000, who remain unemployed. There are still hundreds
of plants in the country which refuse to hire Negroes or which resort
to “token” employment, and there are thousands of other plants — by no
means all in the South — which will not permit Negroes to hold skilled
or semi-skilled jobs and which refuse to give Negroes equal pay for
equal work. Even in New York, the State Committee on Discrimination
reported recently, “discrimination because of color, race or creed
still exists” and employers continue “the old practice of
discriminating against Negroes not by barring them from employment, but
by restricting them to such menial jobs as porters or other maintenance
men.” (New York Times, May 7, 1943) And in an industry
as vital as the railroads, where Negroes have been employed for many
decades, the Office of War Information admitted in April 1943 that “war
or no war, unwillingness to employ Negroes in many types of railroad
jobs persists.”
Negroes hold more jobs than they did before Pearl Harbor, and in
many cases better ones, and that is all to the good. But their jobs are
not as secure as those of other workers. In plants where there are
strong unions, the seniority of Negroes is generally protected. But
even in such plants the probability is that when war production is
ended or reduced after the war, they will be the first fired because
they were the last hired. Thus it is clear that gains in Negro
employment are by no means permanent and can disappear like last year’s
snow with the end of the war. This is not the least of the reasons why
thoughtful Negroes are so concerned about the post-war world.

 
Roosevelt and the Negro
We have indicated why Negro employment increased — not
because of any widespread elimination of racial bias in employment but
because of the manpower shortage. It is necessary to emphasize this
point because there are many scoundrels pretending otherwise and trying
to give the credit for the rise in Negro employment to the Roosevelt
administration and its agencies — scoundrels like the Stalinist James
W. Ford, who says:
“The government has a well-established policy against
discrimination of Negro citizens in war industries. That policy was
established by President Roosevelt’s Executive Order 8802, issued June
25, 1941. One cannot deny that much has been accomplished in the
elimination of job discrimination, that many hundreds of thousands of
Negro workers have been put to work in war industries. The Fair
Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) was an effective instrument in
exposing cases of discrimination and forcing employers to hire Negroes
...” (Daily Worker, April 10, 1943)
To show how Ford lies we need only refer to the brief
history of the FEPC.
Not even its own members ever claimed with Ford that the FEPC was
“an effective instrument in ... forcing employers to hire Negroes.”
They knew too well that Executive Order 8802, from which they drew
their authority, gave them no powers to force anyone to do anything.
The FEPC was set up by Roosevelt to ward off the projected
March-On-Washington in the summer of 1941, and was a concession without
any teeth in it. The FEPC helped a little by a few open hearings to
publicize the scandalous situation in industry, and it prevailed on a
few employers to hire some Negro workers. Its ineffectualness was amply
demonstrated when it held a hearing in Birmingham in 1942, where it was
more or less openly defied by the Jim Crow employers.
Despite its impotence, the FEPC was the object of much opposition,
especially from the Southern Democratic poll tax bloc in Washington,
who hated it as a symbol of the government’s right to “encroach” in any
way on the right of the states to treat the Negroes as they please.
This opposition resulted, in the summer of 1942, in Roosevelt’s
transfer of the FEPC from the jurisdiction of the White House to that
of McNutt’s War Manpower Commission,whose finances are controlled by
Congressional committees largely dominated by the poll taxers. Many
labor and Negro organizations condemned this transfer as a move to make
the FEPC even more powerless than it had been previously, and requested
that it be restored to its previous status. Finally, in December 1942,
Roosevelt answered these protests with the statement that he saw no
necessity for any changes in the situation because the FEPC is “still
under direct control of the Chief Executive.” He also made reference to
the announcement that the FEPC was planning soon to go ahead with a
number of open hearings.
But the goose of the FEPC had already been cooked in spite of these
typically Rooseveltian assurances. A month later Jim Crow scored
another victory in Washington when McNutt, against the expressed wishes
of the FEPC members, suddenly called off an already scheduled hearing
on discriminatory employment policies of the railroads, a hearing which
Negro leaders had described as a “key test” of McNutt’s attitude toward
the Negro. In the four months after this, the FEPC achieved absolutely
nothing: some of its members resigned; Roosevelt promised, again after
many protests had been made, that the railroad hearings would be held
after all; McNutt and Attorney General Biddle called a number of
organizations to a conference to suggest means of reconstituting and
strengthening the FEPC; McNutt explained many times after that
conference that the delay in further action was due to the difficulty
in getting a new chairman for the agency. Finally a new chairman was
secured, Mgr. Francis J. Haas, dean at Catholic University which has
barred Negro athletes from its track meets, and on May 27, 1943,
Roosevelt issued a new executive order establishing a new FEPC which
like its predecessor has now power to abolish Jim Crow in industry.
There isn’t an informed person in Washington who honestly believes
after these developments that the new FEPC will meet a happier end than
the old one.
The fate of the FEPC is a sign of the things to come. To this it
should be added, for the benefit of those looking ahead to the post-war
period, that the FEPC had authority to investigate only war plants and
was never intended to function after the war anyhow.
Roosevelt’s own attitude can be gauged not only by what happened to
the FEPC, which as he insisted was “under direct control of the Chief
Executive,” but also by a number of other events. It will be recalled
that when Negroes were preparing for a march on Washington in June
1941, Roosevelt summoned A. Philip Randolph, Walter White and other
Negro leaders to the White House for a discussion. The following year
Randolph declared on several occasions that the interests of the fight
against Jim Crowism required that “free, independent and courageous
Negro leaders have a frank, candid and plain talk with President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt about the whole situation.” Randolph even
wired the White House an assurance that he wanted a discussion “in the
interests of national unity, effective defense and victory for the
United Nations and the cause of democracy.” But on August 6, 1942
Roosevelt’s secretary curtly replied:
“Regret that owing to extreme pressure on the
President’s time impossible to make appointment requested.”
In 1943 Randolph apparently knows better than to ask
again for such a talk.
Nor have Negroes forgotten Roosevelt’s failure to intervene, as he
had the power to do, to prevent the legal lynching of the sharecropper
Odell Waller. And they see a deep significance in the contrast between
his repeated condemnation of Axis atrocities and his continued failure
to say a word against lynching in the United States. They are likewise
bitterly aware of the contrast between his many declamations about the
four freedoms and his cynical remarks last year while the fate of the
anti-poll tax bill hung in the balance in the Senate:
“... asked whether he thought the poll tax repeal
bill should pass, he reiterated that he knew nothing about it, had
talked to no one about it, and therefore could not express an opinion.”
(New York Times, November 21, 1942)
And this is the man who will probably be at the head of
the government when the present war is ended.
Of course the executive is not the only arm of the federal
government. There is also Congress, and its present members may also be
in office when the peace conference is held. But is there a single high
school student in the nation who does not know that this Congress is at
least as reactionary as the Roosevelt administration? This is the
Congress which is admittedly more conservative than the previous
Congress which permitted anti-poll tax legislation to be filibustered
to death. This is the Congress where the Southern Democrats hold the
undisputed balance of power and where both capitalist parties vie with
each other in wooing the Southern Democrats by appeasing them regularly
on all issues affecting the Negro. This is the Congress where the poll
taxers control the most important committees and use them to uphold and
extend “white supremacy,” as in the case of the Social Security Board
whose chairman, A.J. Altmeyer, was recently intimidated by poll tax
congressmen into promising that hereafter no white stenographers would
be permitted to assist Negroes and no Negroes would be permitted to
furnish stenographic assistance to white employees of that federal
agency.
There is also the judicial division, the Supreme Court, now
controlled by Roosevelt’s appointees. Twice last year, while the
sharecropper Odell Waller sat in death row for killing a man in
self-defense, the court was asked to review the case, and twice it
refused, not even explaining its refusal. Its attitude, however, was
later made unmistakeable by the “liberal” Justice Frankfurter who
stated:
“As a federal judge I am unable to find any
justification for summary interference with the ORDERLY process of
Virginia’s courts of justice.”
That the poll tax bars Negroes and poor whites from
service on Virginia’s juries, that Waller was the victim of a lynch
spirit and a viciously prejudiced judge — all this appears “orderly” to
the gentlemen on the Supreme Court. And why not? It is in complete
accord with the views expressed by this body when it upheld the poll
tax laws, when it upheld the “white primary” rules which bar Negroes
from voting in the most important part of elections in the South, when
it upheld the educational, transportation and other Jim Crow
segregation laws of the South.
The law-enforcement agency of the administration is no better. The
Department of Justice has been hinting lately that it deserves to be
decorated with a few medals because it has followed up a handful of
prosecutions for flagrant violations of the thirteenth amendment to the
Constitution, which forbids slavery and involuntary servitude. But what
has this or any other department of the government done to put an end
to the bloody crime of lynching, which certainly violates that section
of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution requiring that no state
shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection
of the laws”? What has it done about the poll tax and other devices to
disfranchise the Negroes in the South, all of which technically evade
but plainly violate the first section of the fifteenth amendment which
reads: “The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be
denied or abridged by the United States or by any state, on account of
race, color or previous condition of servitude”?
What can be expected after the “war for democracy” of a government
which refuses during that war to enforce its own laws for the
democratic rights of the Negro people? Will such a government, after
the “war for democracy” is won, be likely or willing to pass additional
laws benefitting the Negro? And if it does, will such laws be worth the
paper they are printed on?
 
Jim Crow in the Army
But the capitalist plans for the Negro in the future are
most glaringly highlighted by the government’s treatment of the Negro
in the armed forces today. It is not necessary to recount the whole
story of that treatment in this place. [2]
Every Negro family is already too well acquainted with the details. But
our discussion requires that we at least outline the pattern employed
in the armed forces.
In 1940, with US entry into the war growing imminent, leading Negro
organizations appealed to Roosevelt to drop the Jim Crow bars that
excluded Negroes from most branches of the armed forces and confined
them to segregated regiments in the army and kitchen duty in the navy.
Shortly before the presidential election that year, Roosevelt answered
the protests by stating:
“This policy (not to intermingle colored and white)
has proved satisfactory over a long period of years, and to make
changes would produce situations destructive to morale and detrimental
to the preparations for national defense.”
And although this policy violates Section 4(a) of the
1940 Draft Act which prohibits “discrimination against any person on
account of race or color,” it has been rigidly adhered to ever since,
and applied to every Negro volunteer and draftee.
Protests and the needs of the armed forces compelled the military
authorities to admit Negroes into many branches previously closed to
them. But always, and under all circumstances, this was done on a
strictly segregated basis. Negroes were permitted (a handful, anyhow)
to enter the Army air force, but only after an all-Negro squadron and a
separate and, needless to say, inferior training center had been
established. They were permitted to enter the Navy in some non-kitchen
servant capacities, but only after arrangements had been made to
segregate them in small shore patrol ships and labor battalions in
which they could not become commissioned officers. Similarly they were
accepted into the Coast Guard and the Marines in separate all-Negro
bodies. Negroes are permitted to take officer training — a grand total
of 1,200 during the first 17 months of the war! — but only with the
understanding that they will not be allowed to command any white
soldiers, although naturally with such a small number of Negro officers
for such a large number of Negro soldiers, there will have to be and
are many white officers in command of Negroes.
To change this “satisfactory” setup in the armed forces, says
Roosevelt, “would produce situations destructive to morale.” He does
not say whose morale. [3] But it
is not hard to guess that he means primarily the morale of Southern
ruling class opinion. To protect Southern bias, therefore, the military
authorities try to spread anti-Negro prejudices among hundreds of
thousands of non-Southern white youth in uniform, many of whom went to
school with Negroes and were taught to regard them as equals. To
prevent “situations destructive to morale,” the military authorities
export their prejudices to Great Britain, where the people greeted
American Negro soldiers in the most friendly and comradely manner until
they were ordered to desist in the interest of not hurting the feelings
of bigoted US Army officers and soldiers.
But the utter hypocrisy of Roosevelt’s explanation for segregating
Negroes in the armed forces has been bared most conclusively by his
reaction to a very reasonable request made by several liberal and Negro
organizations representing at least a million people. Very well, they
said in effect, you don’t want to end segregation in the armed forces
and we won’t press you on that; but why don’t you at least permit the
formation of a single mixed division, which would be made up of white
and Negro soldiers volunteering to serve in it? It is hard to see how
anyone could argue against creation of such a division on the ground
that it would produce situations harmful to morale; being made up of
volunteers who would want to show that it is possible for Negroes and
white to collaborate amicably and fruitfully, it would probably have
the highest morale in the armed forces. Precisely for this reason
Roosevelt not only refused to act on the mixed division petitions
delivered to him — he even refused to comment on them.
This incident, and many others like it, indicate that what Roosevelt
and the government are upholding is not morale but anti-Negro prejudice
and the predominant Southern technique for keeping the Negro “in his
(separate) place.” This is upheld in the armed forces because the
Southern rulers fear, in the words of a resolution of the Socialist
Workers Party, “that no Negro trained to handle a gun would peacefully
go back to the old life of discrimination, segregation,
disfranchisement and insult, after training in an army where he was
treated as an equal with white soldiers.” But the logic of segregation
is such that once adopted as a policy for the armed forces there is
nothing to stop it from being extended to all the major and minor
organs and institutions of society. This is precisely what the enemies
of the Negroes want and are striving for.
The issue of segregation is in many respects the most important one
facing the Negro today. It is the last and strongest line of defense of
those who want to keep the Negro down, the stronghold from which a
thousands types of discrimination can be launched. Yet the only Negro
member of Congress, William L. Dawson, who like his colleagues Rankin
and Bilbo believes in the greater glory of the Democratic Party, and
who claims to be a representative of the Negro people not only in
Chicago but in the whole United States, recently declared that such
issues as segregation “fade into insignificance in the light of the
bigger questions raised by this war. America’s enemies now are the foes
of all minorities.” (PM, April 23, 1943.)
But flag-waving won’t solve the problems of the Negro people and it
won’t change the mind of a single one of their enemies. For on this one
issue there is a remarkable unanimity among all leaders of Southern
ruling class thought — both openly reactionary and “liberal.” The
demagogues like Rankin, Talmadge and Dixon rave and rant and threaten
civil war at the very prospect of any breaches in the wall of
segregation; they don’t like it but they don’t object too strenuously
when Negroes in the South get jobs which were always closed to them
before because this helps to win the war which they believe is being
fought to save “the white man’s civilization”; but they declare their
readiness even to secede from the Democratic Party when there is talk
of ending or altering the system of segregation. The “Southern
liberals” show their real colors when this problem is raised, as the
publisher Mark Ethridge did when he warned that
“There is no power in the world — not even in all the
mechanized armies of the earth, Allied or Axis — which could force the
Southern white people to the abandonment of the principle of social
segregation.” (July 1942)
And in April 1943 when more than 100 white “Southern
liberals” met in Atlanta to discuss a program for Negro-white
relations, they expressed the same idea although much more
hypocritically when they stated:
“The only justification offered for those laws which
have for their purpose the separation of the races is that they are
intended to minister to the welfare and the integrity of both races.”
To minister to the welfare and the integrity of both
races is truly a noble aim, and no doubt explains why every outspoken
enemy of the Negro people is so determined to uphold the segregation
laws and practices!
The truth is that all Southern capitalists and their “liberal”
agents stand so firmly on this issue because once segregation is ended,
all else is lost for the oppressors of the Negro people. Once the wall
separating them is removed, the Negroes and poor whites will see that
their interests are the same and they will unite their forces to better
their common conditions. And conversely, if the barrier of segregation
can be maintained for the duration of the war, then the Negro-haters
will be able to use it to extend and intensify their oppression and to
take back whatever the Negroes have gained during the war. For the very
basis of segregation is the myth of “white supremacy” — just as the
basis of the persecution of the Jews in Europe is the myth of “Nordic
superiority” — and so long as that myth can be preserved, the Negro
will be unable to make permanent gains.
The government does more than its share to uphold this myth. Why
should Negroes be segregated in the armed forces and not in federal
housing projects? There is no logic in that, so — a little pressure
from the Southern congressmen, and Negroes are segregated in these
projects even in Northern communities. But why in housing projects and
nowhere else? The poison of bi-racialism spreads further through the
government apparatus and by way of that into all spheres of economic,
political and social life. Uncle Toms like F.D. Patterson of Tuskegee
Institute hail the government when, for example, it opens the air force
to Negroes on a segregated basis, declaring that this is “a definite
improvement” in the conditions of the Negro people. These people fail
to see, or at any rate to admit, that such “improvement” is comparable
to the government striking off a few links in the chain binding the
Negroes only to surround him with another prison wall. But every
thoughtful Negro sees in these developments the intention of their
enemies, with the approval of the government, to establish a strongly
enforced and far-reaching system of segregation which will freeze the
Negro into a permanent position of second class citizenship. To fully
estimate the Negro’s status in post-war America, one must also
understand the economic and political direction in which American
capitalism is moving. In a recent pamphlet [4] we summed up the process as follows:
“The United States is the richest, most powerful
capitalist country in the world. But no more than the others has it
been able to escape the processes of decay which are inherent in
capitalism and are developing ever more rapidly in this period. As in .
the other capitalist nations, here too greater and greater power and
wealth are accumulated in the hands of the monopoly corporations and
heavier restrictions are set on the rights of the masses.
“In its youth capitalism was able to grant
concessions: democratic liberties to certain sections of the masses,
and slightly higher wages to the more skilled layers of the working
class. Today, capitalism is in its death agony. To exist, it must
snatch back the few concessions it was able to give in the past; it
must depress the living standards of all the workers; it must destroy
the democratic rights of all the masses. No capitalist nation in the
epoch of imperialism is immune from this process which is speeded up in
wartime but was in operation before the war and will not be eliminated
after the war if the capitalists remain in power. The United States
capitalists follow in the footsteps of their German brothers, although
at a different tempo.
“Keeping in mind this background, Negroes will best be
able to appreciate what capitalism in this country has to offer them.
When the trend is toward the destruction of all democratic rights, when
more regimentation is in store for the masses as a whole, Negroes have
little to hope for from the capitalist system. When the employers are
trying to take away the few democratic rights of the white workers,
there is little chance that they will willingly extend new rights to
the Negroes. The events of the last decade clearly indicate that under
capitalism the prospect is not for Negroes to be raised to the status
of the white workers but rather for the white workers to be driven down
to the status of the Negroes. And once fascist reaction triumphs, the
Negro’s status may become even more intolerable than it is today.
Negroes can learn from the fate of the Jews in Europe, who made some
gains during the period of capitalism’s rise only to be forcibly
deprived of them when capitalism assumed the political form of fascism.
Like the Jewish scapegoat in Germany, the Negro may face deportation,
loss of whatever citizenship rights he now possesses, mass slaughter
and extermination.”
Fortunately there is another perspective, the
perspective of the socialist revolution and the establishment of a
Workers’ and Farmers’ Government which will, as the Bolsheviks did in
the Soviet Union under Lenin and Trotsky, not only destroy the economic
cause of race discrimination but will also adopt and enforce
legislation guaranteeing full equality to the Negro people and all
other minorities.
It is in the light of this perspective that we can see that the
Negro has made some genuine gains in recent years, gains which have a
permanent character and cannot be erased at the mere command of the
capitalists. These gains are in the trade union movement. More Negroes
belong and there is a greater understanding of the need for Negro-white
solidarity in the unions than ever before. What the white trade
unionists have learned about the heroism and sacrifices of their black
brothers in building the unions and what the Negro unionists have
learned about the need for allying themselves with the labor movement
will make possible the speedier entry of the unions into the political
struggle against capitalism and for the creation of a Workers’ and
Farmers’ Government. In the unions and through the unions, in and
through the revolutionary party, the Negro masses will be able to meet
and defeat the challenge of their enemies in the post-war world.
Unlike most other people and groups who discuss postwar problems,
the Trotskyist aim is not to divert attention away from current needs,
but on the contrary to show by what capitalism offers after the war the
need for struggling against capitalism and all its works today. Unlike
the Dawsons, the Pattersons and the Stalinists, we seek to show the
Negroes that they must not be lulled into passivity and acquiescence by
seeming but actually non-existent “progress.” We try to show the
Negroes what fundamental achievements must be won if they are to make
permanent advances on the road to equality. That is our contribution to
the discussion on the Negro’s future in a capitalist world: to show the
masses what lies ahead and to summon them to the struggle for
emancipation today.
 



EDITOR, Fourth International:
I am sure that when E.R. Frank referred to the Secretary of Labor as “Ma Perkins” (June Fourth International, Page 170), he did so in the same way that thousands of trade unionists do – without thinking.
But the origin of this term is to be found in the fact that Mrs. Perkins was the first woman to be selected as a member of the White House Cabinet. One need not in any way alter his opposition to the reactionary policies carried out by the Secretary of Labor to understand that this “Ma” is an expression of “male superiority,” which is no less objectionable and has no more place in the press of the Trotskyist movement than expressions of national or racial “superiority.”
In the interests of educating your readers and writers, I hope that the next issue of Fourth International, which firmly opposes discrimination against women and believes in full equality for all sexes, races and nationalities, will contain some reference to this question.

Big Business spouts patriotic speeches about “the boys
in the foxholes” every time the workers ask for a wage increase to meet
the rising cost of living. But Big Business patriotism is only a
hypocritical cloak for self-interest. Profits always come first with
the capitalists — even during a war which they want to win. To get
profits and more profits they do not even hesitate to endanger the
lives of the men in the armed forces of this country and its allies.
Here is the proof:
On Jan. 17, 1943 — more than a year after Pearl Harbor —
the S.S. Schenectady snapped in half and sank off the West
Coast, only a few hours after it had been delivered to the Maritime
Commission. The American Bureau of Shipping reported the sinking was
due to the steel plate on the ship which was “brittle” and “more like
cast iron than steel.” The US Senate’s Truman Investigating Committee
took over the case and at a hearing before this body in Washington on
March 23, 1943, the truth came out: The defective steel had been
supplied by the Carnegie-Illinois Corporation, subsidiary of the giant
United States Steel Corporation, whose officials had willfully and
consciously delivered faulty material to the Navy, Maritime Commission
and Lend-Lease administration and had falsified the steel test records
to cover up their tracks.
Testimony before the Truman Committee showed that the faking of
tests had covered at least 28,000 tons of substandard plate; that minor
officials and employes who had complained to their superiors about the
faking of tests had had their “ears pinned back”; that high corporation
officials “instead of cooperating (with the Truman Committee) ...
attempted to delay and obstruct the investigation.” US Steel officials
naturally “deplored” the situation, describing it as “so unnecessary,”
and tried to put the blame on “a few individuals” with good intentions
who had grown “lax.” This alibi, however, was decisively rejected by a
federal grand jury in Pittsburgh in May, which refused to indict four
individual employees offered as scapegoats and indicted the
Carnegie-Illinois Corporation itself.
Equally indifferent to the murderous effects of its frauds was the
Anaconda Wire and Cable Company whose Marion, Ind., plant (financed by
the government) was indicted on Dec. 21, 1942 for conspiring to sell
the government defective communication and other combat wire, although
its officials “well knew at all times” that use of such wire would
“endanger the lives of men in the military service of the USA.” The
Pawtucket, R.I., plant of the company was indicted a month later on
similar charges.
The company was shown to have gone to great lengths to devise
ingenious machinery for escaping government tests of its defective wire
and thus getting the wire accepted for use by the armed forces of the
United States, Soviet Union and Britain. Senator Kilgore has pointed
out:
“The batteries on all our warships, including the
anti-aircraft guns, are fired, controlled, aimed and ranges set, over
this self-same cable, and if the cable is defective, the ship is
helpless against aircraft attack. Also, the safety and success of the
entire land combat forces are frequently dependent on messages sent
overland by these self-same cables.”
The government charged that the conspiracy began about
Nov. 1, 1940 and continued up to Oct. 1, 1942. Commenting on this,
Senator Bone said:
“The fact that we were suddenly plunged into a deadly
war did not in any wise induce the defendants to change the criminal
practices outlined in the complaint. After Pearl Harbor, and while the
boys were dying on the battlefields. Anaconda and its officials
continued their sordid work of defrauding the government by furnishing
faulty cable.”
Bone also declared the cable was “so defective that the
persons deliberately creating the defects would be brought before a
firing squad if they had done this in the war zones.” Attorney General
Biddle called it “one of the most reprehensible cases of defrauding the
government and endangering the lives of American soldiers and sailors
ever to come to the attention of the Department of Justice.”
But it was no more reprehensible than the case of the Wright
Aeronautical Corporation, subsidiary of the huge Curtiss-Wright
Corporation, holder of the second largest war contracts in the country.
Wright’s Lockland, O., plant (financed by the government) was accused
by the Truman Committee in July 1943 of falsifying tests on airplane
engines, destroying records, forging inspection reports, changing
tolerances allowed on parts, skipping inspection operations, etc.
Inspectors who complained were intimidated or transferred. These
activities were aided, abetted and covered up by Army inspectors and
important Army officials influenced by the corporation. The result,
according to the committee’s report, was:
“Engines were built and sold to the government which
were leaking gasoline ... Unsafe material has been discovered In
completed engines ready for delivery. The company’s own reports from
its field representatives indicate that these parts had failed in a
substantial number of cases. A substantial number of airplanes using
this engine have had crashes in which engine failures were involved ...
More than 25% of the engines built at the plant have consistently
failed in one or more major parts during a three-hour test run. Spare
parts were shipped without praper inspection ...”
Accused of exaggerating the gravity of conditions at the
Lockland plant, Truman retorted:
“The facts are that they were turning out phony
engines and I have no doubt a lot of kids in training planes have been
killed as a result. The Committee was conservative in its report, in
order to prevent too much alarm over the situation.”
A number of other and smaller companies were accused of
the same crime during 1943: the Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation of
Detroit, charged with fraud for willfully violating specifications for
engine castings used in Rolls Royce airplanes; the Sandusky Foundry and
Machinery Company of Sandusky, O., whose officials pleaded guilty to
faking tests on propellor sleeves used on Navy vessels; the National
Bronze and Aluminum Company of Cleveland, convicted for selling the
government defective sand and aluminum mold castings which are used in
combat planes; the Antonelli Fireworks Company of Spencerport, N.Y.,
indicted for deliberately selling the Army faulty hand grenades and
incendiary bombs; the Collyer Insulated Wire Company of Rhode Island,
indicted for conspiring to avoid government inspection and deliver
defective wire and cable.
 
Biddle’s Admissions
Nor does this exhaust the list. In a speech in Chicago
on Aug. 23, 1943, Attorney General Biddle reported that Big Business
frauds in this war are “much bigger than they were in 1917 or 1918”; he
declared that 123 federal indictments had already been filed, with
1,279 investigations pending. Biddle did not indicate how many of these
indictments and investigations involve fraud endangering the lives of
servicemen, but there can be no doubt that a substantial number do.
In this same speech Biddle noted that so far 71 cases have been
disposed of, with convictions or other penalties in about 90% of the
cases. But, he complained, in many cases the offenders had gotten off
with extremely light penalties. If anything, that was an
understatement. While a few of the smaller companies have not gotten
off scot free and some of their officials have even been given prison
sentences, the great majority of offenders — and particularly the
powerful ones — have escaped thus far with at most a mere slap on the
wrist. Typical was the trial in Fort Wayne, Ind., June, 1943, of the
Anaconda Wire and Cable Marion plant:
“The most obnoxious fraud ever presented to a court of
the United States!” That was how a prosecuting attorney described the
Anaconda case. “Revolting” was the comment by Federal Judge Thomas W.
Slick, who presided at the trial. Nevertheless, not a single one of the
indicted Anaconda officials spent an hour in jail for their crimes.
Some were fined and given prison sentences, but the judge ordered the
suspension of the prison sentences upon payment of ridiculously light
fines. Anaconda attorneys at the trial volunteered the information that
the company had made $46,000 from the frauds, but the total fines
imposed by Judge Slick came to $31,000. Thus, even after paying these
fines the company had a tidy margin of profit from its criminal
activities!
The company got away so easily by pleading nolo contendere,
that is, not contesting the charges and throwing itself on the mercy of
the court. Its lawyers admitted “technical guilt” but not “moral
guilt”; they explained their reluctance to go before a trial jury on
the ground that such a course “would have impeded the war effort.” The
court, as has been shown, was exceedingly merciful. The judge explained
the suspension of prison terms by saying he felt the guilty officials
“could better serve the war effort by going back to work”; he did not
say whether he meant the same kind of work for which they had been
indicted. The judge also asserted that this disposition of the case
would “stop anything of a similar nature elsewhere” — a view shared by
almost no one else. Thus, the first important trial for wartime fraud
endangering the armed forces indicated that Big Business can get away
with murder.
“But,” some people say, “these are the crimes of individual
corporations, and Big Business as a whole should not be blamed for
them.” This is the position taken among others by AFL president William
Green and CIO secretary James Carey. Contemptible as this argument is —
especially from trade union leaders who are supposed to defend the
interests of the workers against their Big Business enemies — it
deserves an answer.
First, it must be remembered that US Steel and Curtiss-Wright are
not two-bit businesses unrelated to the rest of industry. On the
contrary, they are among the most powerful groups in American Big
Business, being two of the 25 companies which hold 50% of the war
contracts, and they are controlled by the same financial interests that
dominate the national economy. Check the names of their chief
stockholders and boards of directors and you will find listed the same
respected bankers and industrialists who top the list of America’s
Sixty Families.
Second, let it be noted that the revelations of these wartime crimes
have not evoked a single word of criticism or denunciation from a
single important capitalist in this country. The employers’
associations, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Chamber of
Commerce — all have been as silent as the tomb, none has even implied
that there is anything reprehensible in frauds that deliberately
endanger servicemen’s lives. This silence speaks volumes more than a
million consciously deceptive statements by cowards like Green and
Carey, for it indicates that the basic outlook of the corporations
caught in the act is shared by Big Business as a whole.
 
Cynical Whitewash
Third, there is the behavior of the capitalist press,
which reaps fortunes from the big patriotic advertisements inserted in
their pages by the powerful corporations (and paid for out of the
taxpayers’ money). For every line they have devoted to incomplete and
confusing accounts of the war frauds, they have printed ten lines
whitewashing the corporations and trying to smear the Truman Committee.
When used at all, the stories of the wartime frauds have been relegated
for the most part to the inside pages where they will not attract the
same attention as the huge headlines and editorials denouncing the
miners and other workers forced to strike in order to secure a living
wage. This is not because the capitalist press fails to recognize news
when it sees it; rather it is because the press recognizes that these
crimes are a damning indictment of all capitalists.
Fourth, and most revealing, there is the following evidence about
the steel and aircraft industries as a whole: A few days after the
Truman Committee hearing on US Steel had been concluded, the steel
barons began to talk about a threatening decline of 35% in national
steel production. “Lower production prospects are due to the
demoralizing fear the Senate inquiry has instilled into every
steel plant,” said the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, on
Apr. 16, 1943. These reports — inspired by the steel corporations in an
attempt to get the Truman Committee to lay off — showed that the entire
steel industry feared such investigations. The only logical explanation
for this fear is that other steel corporations besides US Steel are
engaged in illegal production practices.
Similarly, when the capitalist press was trying to blame the Truman
Committee for an 85% decline in shipment of finished airplane engines
at Wright’s Lockland plant in the period between April and August,
1943, it was shown that Curtiss-Wright was not the only company
panic-stricken by the prospect of investigation:
“Leading industrialists and production experts the
country over are carefully watching the case,...” the New York
Times, reported on Sept. 2. “The extent to which other
companies and other plants of the Curtiss-Wright group have been
affected by what happened at Lockland is difficult to estimate. Many
other concerns are said to be worrying, however, lest they run into
similar situations ...”
But why should they be worrying if they are not guilty
of the same crimes as Curtiss-Wright? Their apprehension is good reason
for concluding that the Truman Committee investigations have scratched
only the surface of Big Business crimes in this war and that further
investigation would involve all the other big monopolies and
corporations.
 
True to Form
The sale of defective war material has shocked some
people more than the other wartime activities of the corporations
because it is so openly cynical and in such flagrant contrast to the
high-minded sentiments spread over the newspaper advertisements. As a
result there is a tendency to look upon this practice as something
exceptional and unrelated to the general policies of capitalism. But at
bottom it is no different in kind from the other “scandals” perpetrated
by Big Business every day in the year.
The explanation for the policies and activities of the monopolies
and corporations is always to be found in the profit motive. No
employer keeps his factory running unless there is profit to be made
from it. This is as true in wartime as in peacetime, with only one
difference: in wartime there is usually more profit to be made and the
capitalists, maddened by greed, sweep aside all restraints and
obstacles in the way of ever greater profits. Rare indeed is the case
of an employer who has said: “I have got enough.” The tendency of the
ruling class is always to go after more and more. Billions are being
made on war contracts, but even the most powerful corporations do not
disdain to pick up a few millions extra by manufacturing substandard
products and then palming off the defective material as the article for
which they are being paid such generous prices.
But in what sense does this differ from the normal practices of
capitalism? In peacetime Big Business’ concern for profits and profits
alone often results in the shutting of the factories. The hardships
this brings to the whole working class, the undernourishment it visits
on millions of children, the diseases that follow in its wake, surely
take as heavy a toll of human life and well-being as the war frauds.
Who will say which is worse? Who will contend that the cause is
different?
What about war profiteering? The people were solemnly assured that
there would be no war millionaires this time. Yet profits were bigger
in 1942, after the payment of taxes, than they were during the last war
or in the boom year of 1929. And they were 14% higher during the first
six months of 1943 than during the same period in 1942, according to a
report by the Department of Commerce. Which scandal is more detestable
— the war frauds or the war profiteering which will place heavy burdens
on all the masses and act as a drag on their living standards for years
to come? And who will deny the connection between the two?
No, the Big Business “scandals” of this war do not begin and end
with their cynical disregard for the safety of the servicemen. They
began long ago, they touch on every aspect of the war program and they
vitally affect the rights and conditions of every worker.
Ask the sailors at Pearl Harbor and they will tell you what they
think about the manufacturers who sold the Japanese warlords the scrap
metal used to make the bombs that were dropped upon them.
Ask the marines in the malaria-infested South Pacific jungles what
they think about the capitalists who restricted the production of
quinine and other drugs so that they could maintain high prices for
these products.
Ask the aviators and the merchant marine men, who survived the
sinking of their ships what they think About rubber barons and oil
magnates whose demand for monopoly control of rubber in the post-war
period impeded the production of synthetic rubber necessary to build
rafts and other life-saving equipment.
 
Critical Shortages
There are shortages of aluminum, binoculars, critical
chemicals, magnesium, tetracene, dyestuffs, tungsten carbide, etc., all
important materials in wartime. The reason? Because Standard Oil, du
Pont, General Electric, ALCOA, General Motors and the other big
corporations formed cartels with their fellow monopolists in Germany,
Britain, France, Japan, etc., for the purpose of restricting
production, maintaining monopoly and raising prices. More lives have
been lost in this war because of these cartel deals than because of the
sale of defective material.
Other shortages affecting the war program can be traced directly to
the fact that the big corporations have hogged the great majority of
the government’s war contracts. As Assistant Attorney General Tom C.
Clark has reported:
“At the start of the war program in this country
175,000 companies provided 70% of the nation’s manufacturing output,
while today, two and a half years later, the ratio has been reversed to
the point where 100 corporations hold 70% of the war and essential
civilian contracts. This group, he declared, has obtained the bulk of
the fourteen billion dollars worth o! new plants built at government
expense.” (New York Times, April 23, 1943.)
As a result many small plants have been driven to the
wall; with them disappeared their productive capacity, while many of
the new plants remain partly unused and unproductive. A typical example
of how the monopolists impede production is the shipbuilding industry,
where the revolutionary Higgins assembly-line production program was
strangled because it was considered a competitive threat to the
position of powerful companies like Bethlehem Steel.
Other wartime blessings for which the workers can think Big Business
are: the speedup, which resulted in 1942 in a greater number of
casualties on the industrial front than on the military front; an
artificially created manpower shortage — due to labor hoarding by the
manufacturers and big agricultural interests, discrimination against
Negro and women workers, managerial inefficiency — which is used to
justify freezing the workers to low-paid jobs; an aggravation of the
housing crisis in many war production centers, resulting in increased
sickness, disease, child delinquency and disruption of family life;
food shortages designed to force price rises. [1]
Big Business could not get away with all this if there were a
government in Washington seriously interested in stopping it. But the
government is itself the outstanding advocate of capitalism. The
government is well aware of the attitude of Big Business, as was shown
in Monograph No.26, Economic Power and Political Pressure,
issued by the government’s Temporary National Economic Committee in
November, 1940, and stating in part:
“Speaking bluntly, the government and the public are
‘over a barrel’ when it comes to dealing with business in time of war
or other crisis. Business refuses to work, except on terms which it
dictates. It controls the natural resources, the liquid assets, the
strategic position in the country’s economic structure, and its
technical equipment and knowledge of processes. The experience of the
World War, now apparently being repeated, indicates that business will
use this control only if it is ‘paid properly.’ In effect, this is
blackmail, not too fully disguised.”
Blackmail it may be, but the government has given in to
it without complaint or rancor. It has given the employers the greatest
profits in their history; and to pay for these profits, it has piled
one scandalous tax bill after another on the masses, frozen wages and
jobs, prohibited strikes, prevented effective price control, abolished
all limits on big salaries. Big Business has no reason to complain that
it is not being “paid properly,” according to its own lights. To make
doubly sure that they don’t muff any opportunities, the corporations
have offered and the government has appointed a considerable number of
dollar-a-year men to head the most important wartime agencies and
posts. Even the New Deal Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes
admitted on July 21, 1943, that “it is the business men who are running
the war.” And while running it, they see to it that the interests of
the corporations are well protected.
 
Government Cooperation
Even after Pearl Harbor the government was still trying
to get industry to discontinue illegal practices hampering war
production. Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold complained in his
report to Congress on Jan. 3, 1942, about:
“... the attitude of powerful private groups
dominating basic industries who have feared to expand their production
because expansion would endanger their future control of industry ...
There is not an organized basic industry in the United States which has
not been restricting production by some device or other in order to
avoid what they call the ‘ruinous overproduction after the war’.”
The government pleaded with the corporations to
cooperate, to discontinue their cartel deals and violations of the
anti-trust laws, and to let other companies use their patents for war
production; the corporations flatly refused. Early in 1942 the
government — in order to prevent the complete breakdown of the war
program, that is, in order to protect the interests of the capitalist
class as a whole — was finally compelled to institute a series of suits
against a number of monopolies, making public the damning facts about
which the government had been aware for many years.
The corporations had been caught red-handed. But the government,
once having gotten their promise to permit the use of the patents
during the war, dropped the charges and let these corporations escape
virtually unpunished. Standard Oil, for example, whose restriction of
synthetic rubber production had blocked the whole war production
program, was permitted to plead nolo contendere and was given
a $50,000 fine (which amounts to about the average profit this
corporation makes every hour). The other corporations got away even
more easily. To make the government’s attitude unmistakably clear,
Arnold, Biddle, Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of Navy Knox
wrote Roosevelt on March 20, 1942, in the midst of the public
revelations about the cartels, and said that
“... some of the pending court investigations, suits
and prosecutions under the anti-trust statutes by the Department of
Justice, if continued, will interfere with the production of war
materials. ... In those cases we believe that continuing such
prosecutions at this time will be contrary to the national interest and
security.”
This was some more “blackmail,” a threat to hold up on
production if the prosecutions were continued, with government
officials covering up for the corporations. Rosevelt answered: “I
approve the procedure outlined in your memorandum to me ...” Thus,
punishment of the corporations for violating the laws has been
postponed to some remote future in the post-war period, if then.
The same course has been followed in connection with the defective
war material cases. Reluctantly the government has been compelled to
prosecute in a few of the more flagrant cases, but each time high
government representatives have stepped forward to make light of the
corporation crimes.
The War Production Board held a closed meeting on the US Steel case,
but its only outcome was a statement by WPB chairman Donald Nelson
deploring a “more than usual” vigilance on the part of steel plant
inspectors and a WPB telegram to several steel companies urging them
not to lean over backwards while seeking “unattainable perfection” in
meeting production specifications. Other key government spokesmen
issued statements implying that there was no need to worry about the
practices of US Steel.
 
Labor Must Act
When a wave of protest arose after the Truman
Investigation of Curtiss-Wright, Undersecretary of War Patterson, while
not daring to deny the truth of Truman’s charges, nevertheless issued a
statement asserting that conditions at the Lockland plant were “much
less sensational than some of the inferences drawn in recently
published statements.” An Army investigation board under Lt. General
William S. Knudsen also had to admit the Truman Committee charges were
accurate but sought to minimize their importance. Both these and other
government officials seemed more concerned in. quieting public
indignation than in taking measures against the Curtiss-Wright
criminals.
And during the period between Anaconda Wire and Cable’s indictment
and trial, the Offices of the Inspector of Navy Material in New York
and Cincinnati went out of their way to commend Anaconda for its “good
workmanship” and to announce that it was being considered for an “E”
award. During this same period Army and Navy procurement officials
showed how little concerned they were about the corporation’s
malpractices by awarding Anaconda’s Marion plant almost $4,000,000 in
additional business.
The trade union and liberal press have protested against most of the
Big Business crimes and have often criticized government officials for
their behavior. But they continue to regard each of the crimes and
whitewash moves as a unique incident, isolated from all the others and
caused by bungling or some other bad quality of individual capitalists
and government officials. That is one reason why the union leaders and
liberals are unable to work out a program to effectively combat such
crimes.
The workers who are seriously concerned about the present situation
must take another approach. They must learn to look at all the crimes
of capitalism together as a whole and to understand that each
individual “scandal” is part of and flows from the biggest scandal of
all — Big Business domination not only of the war program but of the
whole national economy. They must recognize that Big Business could not
get away with its crimes were it not for the collusion or at best
indifference of the government officials. Only on this basis can they
determine on effective countermeasures. For Big Business will not
voluntarily change its methods, and the administration and Congress
will not and cannot make the punishment fit the crime. If anything is
to be done, it will have to be done by the labor movement.
Whatever else one may conclude from these government actions, it is
safe to say that they do not have the effect of strongly discouraging
war frauds.
Some people have suggested the passage of legislation imposing the
death penalty on manufacturers whose fraudulent practices endanger the
lives of the men in the armed forces. A bill providing this penalty or
a million dollar fine has even been introduced into Congress. It is
hard to imagine the present Congress — which is the servant, body and
soul, of the big corporations — ever adopting legislation to punish
them. The members of the administration who have been rushing into
print to defend the corporations accused of fraud likewise have no
interest in seeing such a bill passed.
Because its adoption would undoubtedly have the effect of
discouraging many corporations from continuing their murderous frauds,
a Socialist Workers Party member of Congress would vote for this bill.
But as he did so, he would warn the workers that its passage alone
could not put an end to the crimes of Big Business for it would not do
away with the basic causes of such crimes: the profit motive and the
corporations’ domination over the means of production.
To get to the root of the problem, the Socialist Workers Party
advocates that the ownership and control of industry be taken out of
the hands of the capitalists. This course of action will be regarded by
Big Business as far more drastic than any bill providing the death
penalty and it will be fought by them with every weapon they have, but
it is the only practical answer to capitalist mismanagement of industry.
At its June 1943 meeting in Toronto, the international executive
board of the United Auto Workers, CIO, drew up a series of proposals
designed to ensure full employment in the post-war period. One of these
called for government ownership after the war of “monopolistic
industries and of industries strategically essential to the national
safety.”
 
Why Postpone?
This is a sound idea, and offers the key to the solution
not only of unemployment, as nationalized production has shown in the
Soviet Union, but also of the criminal practices of the capitalist
class. Let industry be owned by the government and operated under the
control of committees democratically elected by the workers. The profit
motive would be removed, and with it would be removed the incentive to
produce and sell dangerously defective products. The costs of
production would be lowered and the workers’ committees, having no
interest in exacting profits from the blood of the soldiers, would
guarantee production and honest testing in the interests of the masses
of the people.
The UAW executive board proposes post-war government ownership of
industry. But why wait until the war is over? The contents of this
pamphlet demonstrate that Big Business domination of industry menaces
the welfare and safety of the masses in wartime as much as if not more
than in peacetime. The war may last a long time, and so long as Big
Business is in control, the number of victims of capitalist greed will
continue to mount. Meanwhile the big corporations are using the war
itself to smash thousands of smaller businesses and to tighten their
own grip on industry. The longer the workers wait, the harder it may
prove to expropriate the capitalists. The time to act is now.
It will not be easy to put this program into effect. Union men and
women who have had to strike for a wage increase of even five cents an
hour know how vindictively the employers resist every challenge to
their profits; capitalist ferocity will be multiplied a hundred times
when the workers try to take the factories away from them. The daily
press and radio commentators will become frenzied in their
denunciations and incitations to violence against the workers; all the
instruments of capitalist propaganda will be turned on full blast to
bolster the myth that production cannot continue without the capitalist
coupon-clippers, that society cannot function without parasitic
exploiters. And, of course, the capitalists will be aided throughout in
this campaign by their political parties and their agents in the
government.
The question of who is to own and operate industry is a political
problem. To make the change that is necessary the workers will have to
conduct a political struggle against Big Business. The employers
already have their political organizations, the Republican and
Democratic Parties, and to fight them successfully the workers will
have to create a political organization of their own. The capitalist
parties are last-ditch supporters of the system of private property and
private profit which enables the employers to do what they wish with
the means of production. The workers need a party which will be just as
firmly devoted to the program of government ownership and workers’
control of industry. That means an independent labor party, based on
the trade unions and running its own labor candidates in elections.
The present government has already shown where it stands on this
question. The billions of dollars worth of factories, properties and
equipment now owned by the government are going to be turned over at
bargain prices after the war to the employers, who will use them to
swell their profits and to further strengthen their monopoly control.
That is why the workers and their party must fight for the creation of
a new kind of government, one which will aid, not oppose the struggle
for government ownership and workers’ control, a Workers’ and Farmers’
Government.
The wartime production crimes have torn away the mask from the
rapaciously greedy countenance of Big Business. Now the working people
must tear out of the capitalists’ hands the power to continue their
criminal activities.

George Breitman, the editor of Malcolm X Speaks and author of The Last Year of Malcolm X: Evolution of a Revolutionary, gave this speech at the Detroit Friday Night Socialist Forum, March 17, 1967



Three weeks ago the Friday Night Socialist Forum held its third memorial meeting for one of the greatest men of our time, Malcolm X. It was organized in such a way as to provide a broad range of opinion. There was a panel of several local poets, headed by Dudley Randall, reading their contributions to the new book, For Malcolm: Poems on the Life and the Death of Malcolm X. The chairman was attorney Milton Henry, who had worked with Malcolm, published the magnificent record of Malcolm’s Message to the Grass Roots, and was the principal speaker at our second memorial meeting one year ago. The speakers were Dave Wesley of SNCC, Derrick Morrison of the Young Socialist Alliance, and Rev. Albert Cleage, chairman of the Inner City Organizing Committee.
The usual custom at the Friday Night Socialist Forum is to have a discussion period after the formal talks, with the audience invited to ask questions or express opinions. But it was not considered proper to have a discussion period at a memorial meeting, and it was omitted three weeks ago. However there was an unusual amount of desire for further discussion expressed after that meeting, much of it stimulated by the remarks of Rev. Cleage. And so the committee in charge of the forum decided to have another meeting on the subject at the first open date, which was tonight, and to follow the customary practice allowing for discussion.
Much of what Rev. Cleage dealt with in his talk concerned myths about Malcolm X, or what he considered to be myths. I am going to deal with the same subject – myths about Malcolm X, or what I consider to be myths. Since I have spoken and written about this subject before and it is a vast subject, I shall try to confine myself tonight mainly to points raised by Rev. Cleage. That is, I will take his remarks as a point of departure for mine.
Someone asked me if I think it worthwhile to give a whole talk in that form. My answer, of course, is yes. In The Last Year of Malcolm X, I spent a whole chapter discussing the interpretations of Malcolm made by Bayard Rustin, the social-democratic reformist and pacifist, and I consider Rev. Cleage to be a much more important figure in the movement than Bayard Rustin. In 1964, for example, Rev. Cleage led the most advanced expression of independent black political action in the country – the Freedom Now Party – at a time when Bayard Rustin was campaigning for Johnson and pressuring the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party to accept Johnson’s rotten compromise offer at the Atlantic City convention of the Democratic Party. It is true that two years later Rev. Cleage took a backward step – a very wrong and harmful step, in our opinion – when he went back into the Democratic Party to run as a Democratic candidate in a primary election. But even so, he remains the spokesman for an important militant wing of the black freedom movement, and a leader and sponsor of campaigns worthy of support, which we have supported despite his backward step; and what he said in his talk three weeks ago, which I think was his first on the subject of Malcolm, deserves serious consideration.
[The next portion, a 10-minute summary of Rev. Cleage’s speech, is omitted from this transcription.]
That ends my summary of Rev. Cleage’s speech. Of course I haven’t done it justice as rhetoric; Rev. Cleage is one of the best orators in the country, one of the few people who could speak from the same platform as Malcolm without looking bad by comparison. But I have presented all of his main ideas, points and implications as objectively as I could.
I agree with Rev. Cleage that there has been a profusion of myths spread about Malcolm in the two years since his death, and in a moment I will try to explain why. But I don’t agree with him when he says there is a danger that the real Malcolm will be forgotten or obscured through distortion. There was a danger of that when Malcolm was killed, but I don’t think it is a serious danger any longer; at any rate, the danger has grown smaller. I don’t think the real Malcolm can successfully be distorted – whatever Rev. Cleage may say, whatever I may say, and no matter how many more myths may be manufactured and circulated. Because the truth is now too widely known, and becoming better known every day – the whole truth, and not just part of it.
When Malcolm died, there was virtually nothing of what he had said that was in print. But since then many thousands and thousands of people have had the chance to read and hear what Malcolm had said, including large numbers who had never heard of Malcolm while he was alive. Milton Henry told me three weeks ago that he had just returned from the West Coast where he had spoken at a memorial celebration for Malcolm (there were more such memorials held this year than in the previous two) and he said he had run into children, literally children, who were quoting passages from Malcolm X Speaks.
And they were quoting what Malcolm really said and thought, not myths. So we have to keep on knocking down any and all myths that are raised, but I believe we can do this in a spirit of optimism, not despair, because the truth is on the march.
There are many reasons for the myths. Malcolm was a remarkable man, a great man, and when he died, he became a folk-hero. Even if we leave aside the unsolved questions about who arranged the assassination, which were bound to spur various speculations and rumors, Malcolm was the kind of man around whom legends grow – not necessarily hostile legends either; favorable ones too.
But there are other reasons for misconceptions about Malcolm. One of these was the fact that Malcolm was cut down before he had finished his work, before he had formulated all of his ideas and brought them together in a consistent whole. In his last year many people thought or knew that Malcolm was developing new ideas, perhaps a new body of thought, theory or philosophy. But because of the press distortions, and because Malcolm did not yet have an organization capable of reaching the masses, they didn’t know exactly or fully what his thinking was after he left the Black Muslims. This is always a breeding ground for rumor and myth.
More than that. One of the things that distinguished Malcolm from almost all of his contemporaries was his ability to grow, to change, to move forward; even – how hard this is! – to admit an error and correct it. These qualities became more prominent after he broke away from the dogmas of Elijah Muhammad and began, as he put it, to think for himself. Free to think for himself and to speak for himself, he had the courage to admit to himself he had been wrong about something if he thought that was so, and the courage to admit it publicly, and to present a new position that he thought was more correct than an old one. It is the rareness of this quality, along with the vital importance of the questions he was reconsidering, that makes a study of his evolution during his last year so rewarding.
But to people whose minds are fixed in a rut – that is, most of us –  this was confusing. It wasn’t that Malcolm was confused, but that some people, whose impressions of Malcolm had been formed and hardened and pigeonholed when he was a Black Muslim, some of these people became confused when Malcolm changed a position during his last year – merely because he wasn’t saying word for word and slogan for slogan what they had become accustomed to hearing him say. No matter how logically, how lucidly, Malcolm stated these new positions, such people remained confused – some to this day; and when they spoke, their confusion contributed to myths about Malcolm.
And finally there was the malicious motivation for myths, which Rev. Cleage referred to. Because Malcolm became a martyr and hero after his death, some groups have tried to claim him for their own, even though they did not speak up for him when he was alive. They have tried to “interpret” him in such a way as to make his views appear to coincide with their own. In order to do this, they have to try to make us forget embarrassing facts such as their dislike of some of the positions he took.
So what they do is chop Malcolm up, keeping the parts they like, the parts it suits their purposes to remember, and discarding the other parts as unimportant or irrelevant where they don’t deny their existence altogether. This attempt to preserve only part of Malcolm, the part they find useful, while ignoring or denying the other parts that are needed if you want to see the real Malcolm, the whole Malcolm, is of course bound to result in myths, even if they are presented in the name of opposing myths.
Rev. Cleage is absolutely correct when he labels as a myth the story that Malcolm became an “integrationist” as a result of his trip to Mecca in the spring of 1964. This myth, or lie, is spread, as you can expect, by integrationists. Malcolm did not become an “integrationist” at Mecca, or at any time after that. Until the day of his death he remained an opponent of what is generally or popularly understood, or misunderstood, as “integration.” I find it easy to join Rev. Cleage on this point because we, the Marxists, have been exposing and opposing this myth since Malcolm died, even though Rev. Cleage’s remarks may have left some ambiguity about this.
But while Malcolm did not become an “integrationist” at Mecca, or after, his views on race did begin to change at Mecca – his views on race, race relations, black-white relations, the possibility of eventual brotherhood. They began to change there, and they changed even more after he left Mecca and went to Africa and held discussions with many revolutionary Africans. Rev. Cleage did not mention this, but the impact of revolutionary African thinking on Malcolm was much greater and deeper and more profound than the impact of Mecca.
The change, stated too briefly, was this: Not that Malcolm embraced “integration” as a solution, but that he saw the cause of racial oppression in a new light. He saw it as rooted not in merely racial or color differences, but as rooted in economic, political, social and cultural exploitation. From this he began to conclude, not that “integration” is the answer, but that racial conflict might be eliminated by eliminating exploitation; that racial enmity is not inherent in human beings or immutable or necessarily ordained to last for all time; and that it is possible (not certain) that eventually, some day (not now) oppressed blacks and oppressed whites might be able to march together in genuine brotherhood and fight together against their common oppressors and exploiters. But, and he always qualified this thought immediately, it can’t happen until the blacks first organize themselves independently and create their own movement, their own power. No worthwhile alliance can be created, he insisted, until blacks come together first and create their own organization with their own uncompromising program.
Now Rev. Cleage says he doesn’t believe what Malcolm is supposed to have said at Mecca; he says Malcolm wouldn’t have been taken in by the window dressing, that Malcolm was too intelligent to believe that blacks and whites could march together, and so on. Well, this is really an argument between Rev. Cleage and Malcolm, not between Rev. Cleage and people who accurately report what Malcolm said and wrote. Perhaps Rev. Cleage believes that Malcolm was not saying what he really thought; if he does, he should explain why. I, for one, after carefully studying everything I could find, believe that Malcolm said what he thought, popular or unpopular, especially after he left the Black Muslims, was no longer under their discipline and no longer required to express their ideas. If Rev. Cleage believes that what Malcolm said and wrote has been misrepresented by others, then I think he has the obligation to examine what Malcolm said (available on many tapes) and what he wrote (available hi his own handwriting) and to show where the reports are mac-curate or misleading.
It is not enough to say merely, “I don’t believe it.” It is necessary in addition to square this disbelief with the evidence of Malcolm’s own voice and Malcolm’s own pen, and show why that evidence cannot be accepted or trusted. Rev. Cleage said that what has happened with Malcolm enables him to understand better the various myths about Jesus. But we have nothing about Jesus now except myths; we’ve got facts about Malcolm to balance along with myths. The world has changed since the time of Jesus, and in some ways it has changed for the better – especially technologically. I am thinking about the discovery and development of the tape recorder – a marvelous invention. Thanks to it, we can hear and know what Malcolm said, which is the best antidote to mythology that I can imagine.
So Rev. Cleage is on firm ground in rejecting the myth that Malcolm became an “integrationist.” But the reasons he gives for rejecting it are not so sound, and the conclusions he tries to draw – that Malcolm did not change any of his views – have not been demonstrated factually or logically; and I don’t think they can be demonstrated.
I cannot go along with Rev. Cleage when he says that it is a myth that Malcolm wanted to internationalize the Afro-American struggle. Malcolm spoke here in Detroit twice after leaving the Black Muslims –  in April 1964 and in February 1965, one week before his death. On both these occasions Rev. Cleage was present, and at both of them Malcolm called for internationalizing the struggle. What he said both times is preserved on tape, as are many other speeches when he said the same thing. So this is a matter of fact, easily verified.
Besides the question of fact there is the question of interpreting the fact. Rev. Cleage spoke of people who have a mystique about Africa and who say that Malcolm said that the African nations are going to free American black people, and therefore all that Afro-Americans have to do is sit around and wait for that happy day. I haven’t run into many people with this particular interpretation of Malcolm’s call to internationalize the struggle, but of course Rev. Cleage is correct to pronounce this as a distortion and myth, which can only do harm by promoting passivity, instead of struggle.
But this particular distortion or misunderstanding of what Malcolm was talking about does not change the fact that Malcolm did advocate an alliance of Afro-Americans with Africans and other non-whites to coordinate their struggles, and even their strategy, against their common enemy, against what Malcolm called “the international power structure,” whose headquarters he correctly placed in Washington, D.C. I don’t see how anybody can question the fact that Malcolm became an internationalist (this is one of the things that made him so dangerous in the eyes of the imperialists and their CIA), and that internationalism, by definition, means efforts to internationalize the struggle.
One of the ways in which Malcolm sought to internationalize the struggle was by bringing an indictment of racism against the United States government before the United Nations, the so-called world court. He raised this proposal immediately after he left the Black Muslims in the spring of 1964, and he worked hard trying to get African leaders to bring the indictment into the United Nations, and to get American civil rights leaders to join in promoting this project. He did not succeed, for various reasons, but he still had it on his agenda at his death.
When he first publicly raised this project in the spring of 1964, he tended to overstate its possibilities – that is, he gave too rosy a picture of what the probable results would be. The Militant printed an article by me in May 1964, supporting Malcolm’s proposal to take Washington to the United Nations and expose its racism and hypocrisy, but noting that the US government and its allies control the United Nations, and that the UN cannot be expected to do anything seriously against the interests of American imperialism. I didn’t say it as pungently as Rev. Cleage did three weeks ago, when he said you can’t expect any more justice from the so-called world court than you can from the Supreme Court or Detroit’s Recorder’s Court, because all of them are run by crackers, but I said essentially the same thing almost three years ago. Even though my article was critical, Malcolm sent me a message of thanks for writing it.
Now Rev. Cleage says Malcolm couldn’t have believed that much would be accomplished by going to the United Nations, and therefore it is a myth to say he wanted to internationalize the struggle. But this is a fallacy of over-simplification, a non sequitur. The truth is more complex, and the conclusion to be drawn different. Malcolm did get carried away at the beginning about the possibilities of taking Washington to the UN; I am sorry to say this now, as I was sorry to say it then, but it happens to be the truth. And the truth is what we are after, not simplifications. So: at the beginning Malcolm went overboard in what he said could be accomplished by going to the UN. Later, however, he took a more balanced view of the project, he stopped speaking of it as a move that could solve the problems of black people, he corrected himself in assessing its probable results. But he continued to push this project. After modifying what he said about it, he continued to work for it. Because he did want to internationalize the struggle – that’s no myth –  and this was one way of doing it, even though it would not be the final solution, but only a step in that direction. If Malcolm was ready to acknowledge and correct mistakes, I don’t think we do him or the struggle any service by denying either the mistake or the correction; or by saying “I don’t believe” he made this mistake in order to deny that he wanted to internationalize the struggle.
Rev. Cleage’s stated intention – to explode myths in order to preserve the real Malcolm – can only be applauded. But I am afraid that he was only partly successful with some of the myths he aimed at, and that in the process he may have contributed some myths of his own.
His basic mistake, I think, is to present Malcolm the Black Muslim as the real Malcolm, the only one worth remembering, the only one worth building on and continuing from – and to dismiss as unimportant, inconsistent or irrelevant the last year of Malcolm’s life, when Malcolm himself began to build on and continue from his previous positions. This, I submit, is not the way to see or understand the whole Malcolm. Rev. Cleage mentioned the blind men, each of whom touched a different part of the elephant, and came up with a different concept of the elephant. Rev. Cleage is doing that too – he’s saying the hide is the elephant, and the feet and the tail – but not the trunk or the tusks. It is harder to forgive him than those blind men, because he is not blind, and all the parts of Malcolm can be easily seen by anyone who wants to look at them.
I say Malcolm is both the Malcolm of the period before the split and the Malcolm of the year after the split, and I want to see and understand the whole man. I want to see the whole man – the parts that remained constant and never changed, and the parts that did not remain constant and did change; the parts that fit preconceived notions and the parts that contradict preconceived notions; what he was trying to do after he decided to think for himself instead of with the mind of Elijah Muhammad; and in what direction he was moving. That is why in editing his speeches, I included everything available, not just the parts I agree with. That is why in the book about his evolution I was just as concerned in presenting his positions that diverge from my own as I was in exploring those that resemble or approach mine. If I didn’t do that, I wouldn’t really have the right to talk about myths spread by other people. A myth can consist of nothing but the exclusion of relevant facts.
Rev. Cleage wants, in effect, to dismiss the last year of Malcolm’s life; he could find only one favorable statement to make about that year – that Malcolm was beginning to make a transition to organization, to structure. The last year was the period when Malcolm was developing his own ideas rather than popularizing those of Elijah Muhammad. The reason Rev. Cleage wants to dismiss the last year is not that he agrees with all of the ideas of Elijah Muhammad, but that he disagrees with some of the ideas Malcolm was expressing in this, the independent phase of his life. In a moment I will list some of those ideas. First, I want to call your attention to the way that Rev. Cleage seeks to justify such dismissal.
In the last year, Rev. Cleage says, Malcolm was under constant harassment, under fierce pressure, under never-ending threat of assassination. All of this is completely true. As a result, Rev. Cleage continues, Malcolm made a number of confused and confusing statements, fragmentary statements, which unscrupulous people use to distort the meaning and tradition of Malcolm. Is that true? – not how Malcolm’s statements are used or misused, but is it true that Malcolm’s last year was distinguished by confused and confusing statements?
Rev. Cleage says it is true, I say it is not true, and it is up to you to find the answer. Because on it will depend your judgment about whether the real Malcolm tradition ended when he left the Black Muslims, or whether it continued and reached a higher level after he left.
How are you going to decide this? Rev. Cleage more or less invites you to take his word for it, since he doesn’t suggest any alternative or offer any documentation or evidence. I invite you not to take my word, because there is an alternative. And that is: Read what Malcolm said during his last year. Read it for yourself and judge for yourself if it is confused or confusing – or just the opposite. Read the book Malcolm X Speaks, which contains everything from his last year that was available at the time it was published at the end of 1965. It has been in print now for one and a half years and has now been read by tens of thousands of people. So far, not one challenge to its veracity or accuracy has been publicly presented by anybody. Liberator, a magazine which is not sympathetic with the views of the editor of Malcolm X Speaks, calls it “the source book for what Malcolm actually said.”
Then, after you have read it, if you have the slightest doubt about its accuracy, you should listen to the tapes from which most of Malcolm X Speaks was taken. I have listed them all at the end of The Last Year – 22 tapes from Malcolm’s last year – which are available for anyone who wants to listen to them. And since The Last Year was printed there are three more tapes from that period that have become available.
By this method, I contend, you can arrive at a solid judgment not only about the accuracy of the printed material by Malcolm, but also about whether the ideas presented there are confused or confusing; and about whether they are fragmentary, that is, presented out of context. I have no doubt whatever that the outcome of this method of investigation will establish conclusively that it is a myth to assert that Malcolm’s statements in his last year were anything but lucid, carefully thought out, closely argued, and amazingly consistent, despite all the adverse conditions under which he had to operate.
Now what were some of the main ideas that Malcolm developed and adopted in his last year? I cannot deal with this fully tonight, but I have tried to do it in The Last Year of Malcolm X. There I have presented Malcolm’s main ideas, citing in each case the source, the place, the date, etc., and including both the ideas I agree with and the ones I question or differ with. In addition, I have given my interpretation, my interpretation of the significance, trend and direction of these ideas. It will not surprise me if some people will disagree with my interpretations, but it will surprise me if anyone successfully challenges the facts I have presented there.
Malcolm came to the conclusion that the Black Muslims had gone as far as they could go, and he wanted to go farther. He wanted to get into the active struggle, influence it ideologically, and revolutionize it. He wanted to build a new movement, on new foundations, and therefore he reviewed all his ideas – keeping some, modifying others, casting aside still others. He began to move to the left.
The concept that “the white man is the enemy,” which Rev. Cleage calls the essential strand in Malcolm’s philosophy, is the beginning of wisdom for black people who have had illusions that the white power structure is going to hand them freedom on a platter some day. To reject that illusion, and to get to understand that the black man has to fight for freedom, and that he has to depend first of all on his own organized strength, on black power – that is a great step forward, an indispensable step. But it is the beginning of wisdom, not the end of it; it is not a formula sufficient by itself for achieving freedom. After the need for independent black power is learned and absorbed and becomes a guide for action, there are other questions that have to be asked and answered.
If the white man is the enemy, are all white men equally enemies? –  both the white men who have the power in this country, the rulers, and the white men who don’t have power, and who are exploited by the rulers – not exploited as much as black people, but exploited too? If the white man is the enemy, is there some way of dividing the enemy, splitting them, driving a wedge in among them, setting them to fighting each other – to the benefit of the black man? If the white man is the enemy, is there some way of transforming the situation so that some of the whites can be demobilized, or neutralized, or even, under certain circumstances, turned into allies or potential allies of the black man because it would be in their own self-interest?
These are some of the questions Malcolm was beginning to think about and work out in his last year. The main allies of Afro-Americans, he decided, are the black, brown, yellow and red people of the world; but then he also began to see the possibility of alliances with what he called “militant white” Americans. In fact, he said, to bring about the changes that are needed such alliances will be necessary. He didn’t think they would be consummated right away – first, he always stressed, blacks must organize themselves independently, with their own leaders, their own movement, their own program. After they did that, which was his main preoccupation – then there might be alliances with militant whites, the right kind of alliances. And by the right kind of alliances he did not mean working in the Democratic Party.
None of this made him into an “integrationist.” But it did make him go beyond the simple formula, the white man is the enemy, which is not the end of wisdom. It did make him think about and study the causes of racism and to see the possibility of its elimination some day. It led him to study the nature of American capitalist society, and of world capitalism – always from the viewpoint of how the interests of black people could be promoted and protected. And from his thought and study – especially from the thinking initiated through his discussions with African revolutionaries (whose impact on him far exceeded the influence of the religious Muslims in Mecca) – he came to the conclusion that capitalism is the cause of racism, that you can’t have capitalism without racism, and therefore socialism should seriously be considered as an objective by black Americans as well as by Africans and Asians and Latin Americans. At the very least, you can say that in his last year he became pro-socialist and anti-capitalist.
Now these are only a few of the ideas Malcolm was thinking about and trying to work out in his last year, and on some of them, I want to be the first to stress, he had not completed his thinking when he was struck down. Rev. Cleage, who doesn’t agree with some of these ideas, wants to discard these parts from the Malcolm tradition as irrelevant, as confused. He says the great speech, Message to the Grass Roots, made while Malcolm was still in the Nation of Islam, is his last will and testament. But I think the evidence shows that Malcolm added to that testament, if you want to call it that, much that is rich, valuable, indispensable, and that he did it knowingly, consciously, and with a clear mind. You may not agree with what he added, but you can’t say he didn’t add it or that he added it out of confusion.
I would also like to offer an explanation of why Rev. Cleage rejects the contributions of Malcolm’s last year. Rev. Cleage is, and has been since the end of 1963, an advocate and defender of black nationalism. Now when I say that, I am not – as anyone who knows me or the Marxist position is aware – I am not attacking him or using the term as an epithet. As I have said and written for many years, black nationalism is progressive and potentially revolutionary. To show what I mean by black nationalism, to show that it is not a negative thing to me, I would like to read you the definition of black nationalism presented in The Last Year of Malcolm X. Black nationalism, I say,
“... is the tendency for black people in the United States to unite as a group, as a people, into a movement of their own to fight for freedom, justice and equality. Animated by the desire of an oppressed minority to decide its own destiny, this tendency holds that black people must control their own movement and the political, economic and social institutions of the black community. Its characteristic attributes include racial pride, group consciousness, hatred of white supremacy, a striving for independence from white control, and identification with black and non-white oppressed groups in other parts of the world.”
End of definition. In the same chapter I try to show why black nationalism should not be equated with what is called separatism by those who advocate a separate black nation, but I can’t go into that here.
If the definition of black nationalism I have just given is correct, then Rev. Cleage is a black nationalist, and that is not an epithet but, from my standpoint, a scientifically correct designation and an expression of respect. Also, according to this definition, Malcolm was a black nationalist, and remained one to his last day – even though in his final months he began to wonder if that was the right label to describe what he was after.
But within the broad category of black nationalism it is possible to see many subdivisions. (This is one of the reasons why the various kinds of black nationalists unfortunately have been unable so far to unite into a single nationwide movement.) For present purposes I cannot discuss the various subdivisions of black nationalism but have to concentrate on the one I call pure-and-simple.
In Marxism and the Negro Struggle, written in 1964, and again in The Last Year, I have presented the argument that
“The pure and simple black nationalist is concerned exclusively or primarily with the internal problems of the Negro community, with organizing it, with helping it to gain control of the community’s politics, economy, etc. He is not concerned, or is less concerned, with the problems of the total American society, or with the nature of the larger society within which the Negro community exists. He has no theory or program for changing that society; for him that is the white man’s problem.”
When Rev. Cleage became a black nationalist, he became a pure and simple nationalist (in fact, it was by studying his statements, activities and development that I first became aware of this subdivision), and he remains a pure and simple nationalist. Malcolm too was a pure and simple nationalist before he left the Black Muslims, and he remained one for the first few months after the split. But then, after his first trip to Africa in the spring of 1964, mainly as a result of the thinking started by his discussions with African revolutionaries, he began to move beyond pure and simple nationalism, to transcend it – if not transcend it, to add something to it that changed it into something else. What was it he added? He added the belief that society as a whole has to be changed, revolutionized, if black people are to achieve their freedom. This did not contradict his conviction that blacks must control their own community, that is, his black nationalism; it was an addition to his black nationalism. Black control of the black community, yes – but that is not enough, because even a black-controlled black community inside a reactionary and exploitative social and economic and political system cannot provide full and genuine freedom. The implication is that Afro-Americans must fight not only to gain control of their community but also to change society as a whole, to reconstruct it on a truly non-exploitative basis.
Malcolm accepted this implication, which is profoundly revolutionary, without ceasing to be a black nationalist. Rev. Cleage does not accept this implication. That, I believe, is the theoretical explanation for Rev. Cleage’s tendency to reject most of Malcolm’s last period, and, perhaps, not even study it with the care it deserves.
This is not only a mistake, but a sad mistake, because Malcolm was ready to give his life, he did give his life, for the right to be able to say the things he did in his last year. I mean that literally. He could have lived by keeping quiet. But he had things to say in his last year that he considered vital, things that it is dangerous to say, things that he knew it was dangerous to say – and still he put his life on the line for the right and opportunity to say them. To discard what Malcolm himself considered the most important part of his legacy, and for which he gave his life – that is indeed a sad mistake.
Despite my differences with Rev. Cleage’s evaluation of Malcolm, which I have tried to present objectively and without personal rancor, I think I agree with what may have been the main intention of his talk three weeks ago. If I understood it correctly, his main intention was to inspire black people to make the Malcolm tradition their own – to interpret it according to their lights and needs, cherish it, make it a weapon in their struggle for freedom. With that intention I am in full accord.
I think this is already being done, to a far greater degree than Rev. Cleage does. The same night he spoke here, Eldridge Cleaver spoke in San Francisco about how the ideas and tradition of Malcolm have been “internalized” by black people all over the country. That is true, and in addition there is a growing body of written literature about Malcolm by black people, interpreting him and shaping his tradition, which Rev. Cleage overlooks or may not be aware of. On the West Coast there are people like Cleaver, not only writing about Malcolm but trying to continue what he began. In the Midwest, Milton Henry, Robert Higgins, Lerone Bennett, David Llorens. In the East, LeRoi Jones, Calvin Hernton, Rolland Snellings, Lawrence Neal, A.B. Spellman, Robert Allen, John O. Killens, Robert Vernon, Sara Mitchell, C.E. Wilson, – these are only a few of the many black people whose articles spring to mind (I hope the others will forgive me for not mentioning them too) – whose interpretations I may not always agree with, just as Rev. Cleage may not, but which show that black people have been doing what he urges, in sufficient quantity to fill many volumes. James Baldwin is reportedly considering writing a play about Malcolm’s Autobiography; a play called Message from the Grass Roots is soon to open in England. And the poets – I detected a slight tone of condescension or irony in Rev. Cleage’s voice about the poetry by black people about Malcolm, a little surprising when you consider that in his profession he quotes poetry every Sunday – the poets too, in their own way, and it is not a way without influence, are making contributions to the preservation of the real Malcolm.
I agree, as I say, with what I take to be Rev. Cleage’s intention. Malcolm is more than a hero and martyr, he is what Eldridge Cleaver calls “the standard” and “the model.” I think he is and should be the standard and model for revolutionary and radical-minded people of all races, and will be for all who take the trouble to investigate him without prejudice and to learn from him. But he does belong, in a special sense, to black people first of all, and especially to young black people, whom Malcolm counted on to lead their people to freedom. If anyone should be the custodian of the Malcolm tradition, it should be they.
Rev. Cleage called me the custodian, perhaps softening it a bit by granting my sincerity. To make sure, I looked up the word “custody” in the dictionary. It says: “1. keeping, guardianship, care: (example) in the custody of her father; 2. the keeping or charge of officers of the law: (example) the car was in the custody of the police; 3. imprisonment: (example) he was taken into custody.” Well, I am not the custodian of the Malcolm tradition, I have not been, and I do not aspire to be. What I have been, or rather, what Marxists have been – because Rev. Cleage really means the Marxists rather than me personally – are (1) the chief circulators of the Malcolm material, and (2) interpreters of it, from our own point of view.
Circulators, because nobody else showed any interest in doing that job. Of this we are quite proud; we feel it has been a genuine contribution – but it is a task that we do and will gladly share with anyone else. The circulation of this material has been a contribution to everyone, black and white. It is the raw material – not distorted in any way, not dragged in, not partially presented or partially withheld to suit anybody’s factional purposes – it is the raw material which everyone, white or black, can use in order to understand and then fashion the Malcolm tradition. In addition, as I said, we Marxists have interpreted the raw material – again, not by distorting what Malcolm said, only by giving our analysis and opinion about what he said and did. That is everybody’s privilege, that is the duty of anybody who considers himself a radical, and we hope that all tendencies will work out and present their interpretations, as we have done, so that all interpretations can confront each other openly and provide a sound basis for what will be the historical judgment and tradition.
So I join with Rev. Cleage in urging black people to find out what Malcolm really said and stood for, write about it, preserve it, interpret it, circulate it, and use it in the struggle. All I say is that when you do this, don’t do it partly – do it all the way; don’t chop the Malcolm tradition to pieces – preserve the whole thing, confront the whole Malcolm, preserve the whole Malcolm, utilize the whole Malcolm to advance and win the struggle. If you do, and if your aim is to revolutionize society, then I think you will cherish the final part of the whole Malcolm, the part that he gave his life to add, as the most useful part because it is the most revolutionary.

From the Discussion Period
Question: Rev. Cleage said he didn’t know anything about Marxism. You say Malcolm was not a Marxist, but did he know anything about it – had he read or studied it?
Answer: What Rev. Cleage actually said – and I quote from the transcript of his speech, which I have here –  was, “I am not a Marxist – I don’t pretend to be, I don’t even pretend to know anything about it.” Maybe the key word here is “pretend.” I don’t know how much he knows about Marxism, but in one speech he gave in this hall some years ago, and in at least one article he wrote, he gave some reasons why he does not accept Marxism. So I imagine he has some knowledge about it. Or else I don’t see how he could reject it.
Of course I think everybody, and especially leaders, should find out about Marxism, whether they will accept it or not. I can’t say for sure whether Malcolm did, or how much. I know that he read papers and magazines that claim to be Marxist, including small, obscure and uninfluential ones. When I wrote an article for the International Socialist Review in 1964, attempting to present a Marxist defense of the Freedom Now Party against various misconceptions, including some spread by so-called socialists, I know that Malcolm ordered a couple dozen copies for leading members of his organization because he thought they should be acquainted with this point of view.
Someone who knew Malcolm in prison before he became a Black Muslim, and later worked closely with him in the Nation of Islam, told me that Malcolm did read and study more than radical papers and magazines; that even while he was in prison he read some radical books and pamphlets, and that he later read some basic works of Marxism. But I am not sure of this from my own knowledge.  
Question: Rev. Cleage said that if Malcolm had actually become an “integrationist” at Mecca, then he could have become a Marxist and joined the Socialist Workers Party. Does he really think that believing in “integration” is a condition for joining the Socialist Workers Party?
Answer: What Rev. Cleage said was that if Malcolm had actually become an “integrationist” and accepted the ideas that go with that concept of race relations, then there would have been nothing to stop him from joining the NAACP, or singing We Shall Overcome with Martin Luther King, or becoming a Marxist and joining the Socialist Workers Party. In fact, Rev. Cleage said, these things would follow logically.
On the contrary, leaving the bit about the NAACP and King aside, there is nothing logical about it. The Socialist Workers Party does not view “integration” as the solution any more than Malcolm did, or than Rev. Cleage does; in fact, the Socialist Workers Party reached this conclusion before Rev. Cleage did. So even if Malcolm had become an “integrationist,” that wouldn’t have been any reason for him to join the Socialist Workers Party.
Let it be clearly understood: Malcolm was not a Marxist, and he was not about to join the Socialist Workers Party. That’s what we said when he was alive, and that’s what we’ve said ever since. The only ones who circulated a contrary story were his enemies – as a way of discrediting him, they thought.
The facts are these: Malcolm respected the Socialist Workers Party, and was willing to work with it in certain areas – just as he would have been willing to work with any organization that he believed was opposed to racism and the racist government. He praised The Militant as one of the best papers anywhere, and there were copies on sale at his headquarters. He had become pro-socialist in his outlook after his trips to Africa, urging black people in this country to learn about socialism – and he did this not only when he spoke before socialist audiences, but also “at home,” when he spoke before his own organization in Harlem.
Despite this, he was not a Marxist, for reasons I have discussed in The Last Year of Malcolm X. Whether he would ever have become a Marxist, nobody can say. The most you can say is that it was possible in the long run. But he was not a Marxist at the time of his death, much as we wish he would have become one, and we Marxists have never claimed he was. Anybody that says we do is guilty of misrepresentation.  
Question: The impression I got from listening to Rev. Cleage last month is that he was saying that after Malcolm died and couldn’t speak for himself, the Marxists jumped on the bandwagon in order to distort his views and print speeches which he wouldn’t have printed, “fragmentary statements” and so on. Will you comment on this and Malcolm’s relations with the Socialist Workers Party?
Answer: Well, Rev. Cleage did not quite make that specific charge against the Marxists in his talk three weeks ago. But I do believe that when he spoke about distorters, calling them “they” and “somebody else,” when he said certain people remember “the things it suits their purposes to remember,” when he said “everything that is written that they can put their hands on will be saying that Malcolm X said something he never said, that Malcolm X meant something he never meant,” when he said, “I don’t care what else they drag in from wherever they drag it,” and similar statements – I do believe that he meant at least to include the Marxists among his targets. And that would support the impression you got.
First of all, I should point out that our interest in Malcolm, the sympathetic interest of the revolutionary socialist movement in his ideas, did not begin after his death in 1965. Nor did it begin only after his split with the Black Muslims in 1964. It goes back further than that, to the time when he was still a Black Muslim. You can read the pamphlet, Freedom Now, adopted in the middle of 1963, and see that the Socialist Workers Party, in that resolution adopted at its national convention, pointed out the progressive potential of black nationalism – that is, while Malcolm was still a Black Muslim, we were pointing out the good aspects of what he was saying. If that can be called jumping on a bandwagon, all I can say is that there weren’t many other people on it besides us.
Even before that, the Friday Night Socialist Forum of Detroit was the first socialist hall in the country where a Black Muslim was a guest speaker – Wilfred X, who was received in a sympathetic way because we saw the potential of the Black Muslims while Malcolm was a leader. Later that year, in the fall of 1963, Malcolm was a speaker at a meeting sponsored by the Young Socialists at Wayne State University –  still while Malcolm was a member of the Nation of Islam.
When Malcolm broke with the Black Muslims in March, 1964, The Militant was the only paper in the country to point out its great significance for the future of the freedom struggle and the radical movement as a whole – we predicted then that he could change the whole course of the movement, the same thing Rev. Cleage said after the fact here in 1967; and it was the only paper in the country to print Malcolm’s Declaration of Independence in March, 1964.
In the following 50 weeks Malcolm spoke three times at the Militant Labor Forum in New York, and the last time he said he’d speak there again any time he was invited. Again and again he praised The Militant, not only when he spoke at the Militant Labor Forum, but also when he spoke before his own Organization of Afro-American Unity in Harlem. In his talk on Afro-American history one month before his death, he mentioned that the Negro press largely ignored what the OAAU was trying to do, while The Militant reported it accurately and fully.
Malcolm’s three Militant Labor Forum speeches were all printed in The Militant
while he was alive, not later. He didn’t think they were inaccurate in any way. If he had thought so, you can be sure he would have said it, and he wouldn’t have had a bundle of The Militant on sale in his office. He did not think the printing of those speeches was something “dragged in” – on the contrary, he was grateful that this paper was willing to print them at a time when nobody else would. A month before his death, he agreed to go on a national speaking tour for the Young Socialist Alliance; and if he hadn’t been killed, he would have spoken here in Debs Hall during that tour.
Excuse me for taking so long with this, but I’m still speaking about the myths about Malcolm, and I want to say a few words about the key book to understanding him, the book of speeches, Malcolm X Speaks. This book begins with the Message to the Grass Roots, when Malcolm was still a Black Muslim, and which Rev. Cleage admires; but the rest is from his last year, after the split, about which speeches Rev. Cleage had nothing good to say. The idea for this book, it is true, was suggested by Marxists, who wanted to help Malcolm publicize his independent ideas. But it was not a book thought up after Malcolm’s death – it was suggested to Malcolm himself, while he was still alive, as a book of his speeches following the break with Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm’s response to the suggestion was favorable, and he was going to select the speeches himself. But he was killed a month later, before he could start on the project.
Merit Publishers then asked one of Malcolm’s closest co-workers, who had been present at the original discussion about the proposed book, to select the speeches for the book and edit it. In The Last Year of Malcolm X, I have told how I was later brought in as co-editor, to speed up the publication, and how finally Malcolm’s co-worker withdrew from the project. But before he withdrew we had agreed on the contents, most of which had been supplied by him – the speeches the book contains. So their selection was not a unilateral choice of Marxists, but one made in collaboration and agreement with one of Malcolm’s closest collaborators – who, I should add, not only was not a Marxist, but did not approve of Malcolm’s entry into any kind of politics. The book contains everything from Malcolm’s last year – I repeat, everything – that was available when the book was published in 1965. Since then, other speeches have become available, such as the one by Malcolm on Afro-American history, and that has been published too, verbatim, without any change.
I stress “everything” because I want to make the point that the material was not picked over to present only things that Marxists like and agree with – it includes what Malcolm liked and agreed with, and that was the sole and overriding criterion that was used in preparing Malcolm X Speaks. So, yes, “everything we can get our hands on” has been printed, but, no, nothing has been “dragged in.” I told you earlier how you can check this for yourself.
This is important because Malcolm X Speaks, more than anything else, and more than what people claim they remember without any documentation, is the basis for forming your judgment about the value of Malcolm’s last year. You know, Malcolm was not a fool; if he had thought we might misrepresent his ideas, he wouldn’t have trusted us an inch. And he did trust us. But you don’t have to trust us or take our word for anything. Malcolm himself had some wonderfully pertinent words about this in his remarks to Mississippi students visiting Harlem two months before he died. He said:
“One of the first things I think young people, especially nowadays, should learn is how to see for yourself and listen for yourself and think for yourself. Then you can come to an intelligent decision for yourself. If you form the habit of going by what you hear others say about someone, or going by what others think about someone, instead of searching that thing out for yourself and seeing for yourself, you will be walking west when you thing you’re going east, and you will be walking east when you think you’re going west. This generation, especially of our people, has a burden, more so than any other time in history. The most important thing that we can learn to do today is think for ourselves.
“It’s good to keep wide-open ears and listen to what everybody has to say, but when you come to make a decision, you have to weigh all of what you’ve heard on its own, and place it where it belongs, and come to a decision for yourself; you’ll never regret it. But if you form the habit of taking what someone else says about a thing without checking it out for yourself, you’ll find that other people will have you hating your friends and loving your enemies. This is one of the things our people are beginning to learn today – that it is very important to think out a situation for yourself. If you don’t do it, you’ll always be maneuvered into a situation where you are never fighting your actual enemies, where you will find yourself fighting your own self.” (Malcolm X Speaks, pp. 137–138, paperback edition.)
 



Malcolm X believed that the education, or re-education, of the black people of this country was necessary for the building of a new mass movement capable of fighting effectively for human rights. He therefore took every opportunity he could get – on television and radio, at press conferences, interviews and public meetings, large or small – to teach, to explain, to show the connections between various aspects of the freedom struggle, to induce people to think for themselves. He always adapted his speaking style to the particular audience he faced, using the vocabulary and the rhythm best suited for communication. The speech that follows, which has been transcribed from the tape of a public meeting on January 24, 1965, is typical of those he made in the last months of his life to the people of Harlem.
Malcolm left the Nation of Islam (“Black Muslims”) in March 1964 for reasons partly explained in this speech. That month he organized the Muslim Mosque, Inc., and in June, 1964, he founded the non-religious Organization of Afro-American Unity. He was abroad – in Africa, the Middle East and Europe – during half of this independent phase of his life, which ended after a short fifty weeks with his assassination in New York on February 21, 1965. Yet he managed, during the 25 weeks he spent at home, to hold 17 or 18 public rallies in Harlem, most of them at the Audubon Ballroom. It was in that hall, as he started to speak at one of those rallies, that he was killed.
Sometimes there were invited guest speakers at these public meetings – African students, Dick Gregory, Muhammad Babu of the Tanzanian cabinet, Fannie Lou Hamer; Che Guevara was invited once, but couldn’t make it, and sent a message of solidarity. Sometimes films were shown. But the main speaker was usually Malcolm himself. He was often over-worked and exhausted, but he was never too tired to present, patiently and calmly, facts and ideas and arguments that he believed his brothers and sisters needed to arm themselves for the freedom fight.
The January 24, 1965, speech was typical of his final period, but it also had special features. At that time the leaders of the Organization of Afro-American Unity had decided that their organization needed a new program. To arouse interest in it, they arranged a series of three public meetings at the Audubon. At the first of these (January 24), Malcolm was to speak on Afro-American history, from the ancient black civilizations through slavery to the present day. At the second (January 31), he was to discuss current conditions and the methods used to keep black people oppressed. At the third (which would have been February 7, although Malcolm twice made a mistake about that date in his January 24 talk), he was to speak about the future of the Afro-American struggle and the new OAAU program was to be presented.
This schedule was never completed. Malcolm did speak about the past on January 24, and he did speak about the present on January 31, but the third meeting was not held on February 7, because Malcolm had some important speaking engagements in England and France that week.
The third meeting in the Audubon series therefore was postponed to Monday, February 15; the regular Sunday time was not possible because Malcolm was scheduled to speak in Detroit on February 14. But a few hours after Malcolm’s return from England, his home was fire-bombed, early in the morning of February 14, while he, his wife and four children were asleep. As a result, the February 15 meeting was devoted to a discussion of the bombing, and the presentation of the new OAAU program was postponed. At the next meeting, February 21, Malcolm was shot down as he started to speak at the Audubon.
Two other Audubon speeches (December 13 and December 20, 1964) will be found in the collection, Malcolm X Speaks (Merit Publishers, 1965, and Grove Press, 1966). The text of the OAAU program, which Malcolm approved although he did not write it, is printed as an appendix in my book, The Last Year of Malcolm X: The Evolution of a Revolutionary (Merit Publishers, 1967).



 


George Breitman



 



A year has passed since the Negro March on Washington was called off and the growing mass movement around it was smashed. It should now be possible, therefore, by examining what has happened since then to the Negro struggle, to draw the necessary conclusions about the experiences of the March-on-Washington movement, and particularly about the policies of its leadership.
This movement was in existence for only a few months, it failed to achieve the purposes for which it was created, and it disintegrated in a few days. Nevertheless it was the most significant mass movement of Negroes in many years.
It was significant because it showed that the Negro masses had lost confidence in the old movements and methods offered for achieving the abolition of racial discrimination in industry, in government jobs and in the armed forces. Hitherto they had followed the leadership of the professional hat-in-handers, who told them that their salvation lay in acting “respectable” and voting for the “right man” – the right man being the capitalist politician who threw the misleaders of the Negro people a few crumbs every now and then.
The masses observed the approach of full United States participation in the war, they saw the war boom of industry all around them, and they were inspired by the successful organization campaigns of the trade union movement in industries where no headway had ever been made before. At the same time they were painfully aware that Negroes were still segregated in the Army, assigned to kitchen duty in the Navy and barred from the Marine Corps; they saw the total number of unemployed workers decreasing while the number of Negro unemployed remained stationary; they knew prices were going up, relief was being cut, and they were still barred from the overwhelming majority of jobs that paid half-way decent wages.
The conditions for a Negro mass movement were thus created. A. Philip Randolph and the others at the head of the March-on-Washington movement were able to assume its leadership only by speaking the language of militancy, by telling the masses that they had the power to improve their conditions if they would organize themselves and exert their mass pressure on Washington. The enthusiastic response of the masses, the swift wave of fighting optimism and the willingness to sacrifice for the struggle that swept the Negro population were evidence that the Randolphs had not created the movement – they were only capitalizing on the already existing sentiments of the masses. When Randolph first wrote about the march in January 1941, he said he thought it might be possible to have 10,000 Negroes marching down Pennsylvania Avenue; in two or three months, despite extremely poor organizational work, Randolph could predict 50,000 marchers, and before the march was called off at the end of June, he could claim to speak for 100,000 people preparing to march to Washington.
Another very significant thing about this movement was that it was not administered a direct defeat in action by its open enemies. Two weeks before the date set for the march a barrage was opened by the administration; every kind of attempt was made to have it called off; so-called “friends” of the Negro people such as Mrs. Roosevelt and LaGuardia appealed in the name of patriotism, and threatened that the march would “set back the progress which is being made”; Roosevelt himself took the unprecedented step of issuing a proclamation asking all employers to examine whether or not their employment policies made provision for the utilization of available and competent Negro workers. But none of this had the effect desired. The local march committees meeting that week refused to be taken in and they insistently let the Randolph leadership know that they wanted the march to go through unless they were actually granted what they had demanded.
A week later, Randolph and Co. “persuaded” Roosevelt to issue his Executive Order 8802, and then Randolph bureaucratically called off the march in a radio speech hailing the executive order as a second Emancipation Proclamation. Thus Randolph did what neither administration threats nor promises had been able to do. The movement melted away in short order as its members began to understand how they had been sold down the river. But the masses did not walk out because they felt defeated, or because they thought that their fight could not be won. They had not lost confidence in themselves or their ability to win the fight against Jim Crow – only in the Randolphs and their policies. When Negro misleaders and government agents deplore and grumble about “poor Negro morale,” they may not know it but they are really talking about the determination of the Negro masses to continue the struggle for equal rights, war or no war.
To see why the Negro ranks want to continue that struggle, despite the unhappy experience of the march and the pressure of the war regime, it is necessary only to examine the terms of Roosevelt’s executive order and to sum up the present state of Negro rights and conditions.
Randolph’s avowed aim for the march was an executive order decreeing the abolition of discrimination in the Army, Navy, Air Corps, Marines and on all war production. Despite his praise for Order 8802, not even Randolph was able to pretend that Roosevelt had granted what the Negro ranks wanted.
 
What Roosevelt Gave the Negroes
In the first place, the order concerned only discrimination by employers in “defense industries.” The order did not abolish discrimination in industry. It stated that all contracting agencies of the government would
“... include in all defense contracts hereafter negotiated by them a provision obligating the contractor not to discriminate against any worker because of race, creed, color or national origin.”
But what would happen to employers who violated such contracts? Randolph and the Negro press had been demanding that Roosevelt put “some teeth” into the order – that such employers be fined and their contracts withdrawn. Roosevelt’s order included no measures for punishing violators, which could be and was interpreted by the capitalists generally to mean that there would be no crackdown for violations.
Instead of putting teeth into his order, Roosevelt created a Committee on Fair Employment Practices which was to “receive and investigate complaints of discrimination in violation of the provisions of this order” and “to take appropriate steps to redress grievances which it finds to be valid.” But what effective steps could it take when it didn’t have the power to fine employers or revoke contracts? The committee has proved able only to hold local public hearings at which representatives of employers and workers speak about the situation in particular factories. Such publicity and private discussions with some employers who openly disregarded the no-discrimination provisions have resulted in a few Negroes being employed in plants where none had been employed before, But these are what the president of the New Jersey CIO has aptly described as “token employment.” Many employers have hired a half-dozen Negroes and point to them as proof that they do not discriminate. The committee is unable to do anything in these cases but “urge” that the employers comply with the spirit as well as the word of the executive order.
A recent press report demonstrates how weak and ineffective the committee has been. On April 12, more than nine months after the executive order, the committee issued a statement calling on ten industrial concerns “holding millions of dollars in war contracts” in the Chicago and Milwaukee areas to stop discrimination in employment. The companies include a General Motors Buick plant, a Studebaker branch factory, the Stewart-Warner Corporation, Allis-Chalmers and the Heil Company which is owned by the governor of Wisconsin. They are accused of giving orders to private and public employment agencies to submit employment applications of only white and Gentile workers; of advertising in newspapers only for whites, Gentiles and Protestants; and of having refused “to give workers of specified races or creeds opportunities for promotion in keeping with their qualifications.” Open violations of this kind indicate in what contempt the monopolies hold the executive order and the president’s committee. To finish the picture, it should be stated that this is the first time in its existence that the committee has taken so drastic a step as to name violators; it probably was done only after the committee had pleaded piteously with the employers involved to mend their ways. The only answer of the companies has been denials that they are guilty of discrimination. And there the matter rests.
It would be incorrect to conclude from this that additional Negro workers have not secured employment since the order was issued. Although there are no official figures on the question, occasional reports in the Negro press would indicate that several thousand Negroes have secured jobs in industry since last June. There is the “token employment” referred to above. In the second place, government agencies have been able to secure a few thousand jobs for Negroes from employers who are so busy piling profits into the bank that they are not concerned with what they consider to be secondary matters, or from employers who felt for local reasons that they had nothing to gain from discrimination. In the third place, Negroes have been able to get some jobs in a number of non-war industries as white workers leave, attracted by the generally higher pay and steadier work of the war industries.
More important, there has been a growing recognition inside even that minority of the trade union movement which barred Negroes from membership that a Jim Crow policy helps only the employers; in recent months there have been encouraging reports about AFL unions threatening to strike unless Negroes were hired by the companies with which they held contracts and about AFL local unions voting, despite the discriminating constitutions of their international organizations, to open their books to Negro workers. In the CIO, where the formal bans against racial discrimination have generally been respected, there are inspiring reports of white workers paying more than lip service to the struggle for Negro equality, winning jobs and promotions for their colored brothers despite the discriminating practices of the employers.
Finally, and this is by far the most important factor, a shortage of skilled and even unskilled labor is beginning to make itself felt; and employers who used to pretend that they could not hire Negroes because it would create resentment and “labor difficulties” among their white employees, have not hesitated where they could not get white workers to employ Negroes in the unskilled and lower paid positions. This process has been halted somewhat by the layoffs due to conversion of plants to war production and the increasing employment of women workers; but undoubtedly within the next year it will be resumed.
Thus most of the jobs the Negro people have received in the last year or will receive in the next are the result of the needs of the war machine, not of a successful struggle to abolish discrimination. This means that when the war is over the Negro worker will again be the first to be fired – except in those cases where he belongs to a strong trade union which is willing and able to protect his seniority rights; and even this will not be very much protection because the Negro is still the last one being hired in the war industries.
 
Roosevelt’s Jim Crow Armed Forces
While Roosevelt has recognized on paper the right of the Negroes to equal treatment in industry, he has never recognized their right to equal treatment by the government in the armed forces. Here the needs and aspirations of the Negro people run smack into the opposition not of an individual employer or corporation, but the government itself.
By conscription the government has already provided the mechanism for drawing into the military struggle as many Negro soldiers as it will require. The administration does not object to using the Negroes in the armed forces any more than it objects to having the employers use Negroes to turn out the materials of war. And perhaps Roosevelt as an individual might have no objections to granting the Negro people the right to serve in the armed forces on the same basis as anyone else.
But Roosevelt is not in Washington as an individual – he is there as the leader of the Democratic Party, and by the grace of the viciously anti-Negro leaders of the Democratic Party of the South. Oppression of the Negro people is not an exclusive product of the South; the mob violence to prevent Negroes from moving into the Sojourner Truth federal housing project in Detroit on February 28 is proof of that. Nevertheless the oppression of the Negro plays a special role in the South; indeed, this oppression is at the foundation of all the power and profits of the Southern ruling class. The Bourbons know that they remain in power only through the super-exploitation of the Negro; when the “representatives” of the South in Congress rant about what they would do if “radicals” try to organize the Negro and restore their right to vote, they mean what they say, they would not hesitate to drown in blood any attempt to abolish the Jim Crow system.
These Southern Congressmen wield – through the poll tax and similar devices – a disproportionate influence not only in Congress, but also in the Democratic Party; without their support Roosevelt would not have been elected in 1940. Hence Roosevelt’s silence on anti-lynch legislation in the most liberal days of his New Deal. Roosevelt may have his differences on some questions with his Southern colleagues, but he does not dare to offend them or to cross them on what they call the color question.
The Jim Crow elements of the South dislike the use of the Negro in the armed forces; their resentment at seeing a Negro in uniform is at the bottom of most of the violence against Negro troops in the South. But war is war, and the more far-sighted of these elements realize that if Negroes are required to save what Congressman John E. Rankin of Mississippi calls “our way of life and our sacred institutions so that the white man’s civilization may not perish from the earth,” then Negroes will just have to be used in the armed forces.
But not as equals! The Southern ruling class will not have them get any uppity ideas about “being as good as a white man,” as so many Negroes did when they returned from the first “war for democracy.” The Southern ruling class lynched the Negroes wearing uniforms on the street after 1918 to teach the Negro people that they had not been fighting for democracy for themselves. It wants to make sure that the Negroes will not have any illusions about this war too; hence in the armed forces they are to be branded as second-class citizens. For, as the National Committee of the Socialist Workers Party put it almost two years ago, the Southern Bourbons
“... fear that no Negro trained to handle a gun would peacefully go back to the old life of discrimination, segregation, disfranchisement and insult, after training in an army where he was treated as an equal with white soldiers.”
 
Roosevelt’s Alibi – and the Reality
So Roosevelt, despite the pleas of Randolph and Co., made no concessions in this field when he wrote his executive order last year; in fact, he did not even mention the armed forces in the order. It was not until April 5 of this year that he had anything to say about it. In a letter to the Fraternal Council of Negro Churches on that date, he summed up the administration’s policy as follows;
“At my direction, the armed services have taken numerous steps to open opportunities for Negroes in the armed forces of our country, and they are giving active consideration to other plans which will increase that participation.”
In other words, there are more Negroes in the armed forces than there were a year ago, and they have been given the opportunity to serve in a few more branches of the service. But segregation continues untouched! Negroes must still serve in separate regiments. These separate regiments are now being gathered together into divisions – as separate all-Negro divisions (all-Negro, that is, except for white officers). Negroes must still eat separately, sleep separately, march separately, pray separately, watch a movie separately, in this army ostensibly warring for democracy.
Segregation of this kind is hateful not only because it is a violation of the most elementary principles of equality and democracy and a token of the treatment the Negro will get after the war. It also lays the basis for the kind of discrimination that often makes the difference between life and death. It is much easier for Jim Crow elements in the General Staff to pick part of a Negro regiment as a “suicide squad” than it would be to pick the same number of individual Negro soldiers out of mixed regiments for the same job. This happened in the last war, and it happened in France in this war
when the lives of thousands of Negro colonial soldiers were thrown away simply on the basis that they were considered “inferior,” and could easily be assigned to the suicide work because they were in segregated regiments.
Roosevelt talks about the opportunities being opened – but the chief opportunity the Negro sees is to be killed or beaten by Jim Crow elements in the Army and out of it, long before he is even sent overseas. No amount of honeyed words can make Negroes forget how they are humiliated by the Southern police and mobs; how Ned Turman was shot to death in Fort Bragg last summer because he protested against MP brutality and resisted it with the cry, “I’m going to break up you MP’s beating us colored soldiers!”; how scores of Negro troops were shot and beaten by MP’s and state troopers in Alexandria, La., last January, because some of them objected to MP brutality; how in the last two months five Negro soldiers have been shot dead in New Jersey, Arkansas, Texas, and Virginia, and countless Negro soldiers attacked in these and other states.
Symbolic, too, of the opportunities offered the Negro soldiers is their first overseas assignment – Australia, where Negro immigration is forbidden by law and where the natives who inhabited the country before the whites came are segregated on reserves or on islands off the continent. And even there, where the very existence of Australian “democracy” is in danger, the United States Negro troops have been sent not as fighters, but as labor battalions.
The “other plans” which Roosevelt referred to on April 5 were the new regulations for Negro service in the Navy announced by Secretary Knox on April 7. These regulations were finally put into effect because of the national wave of protest against Navy segregation of Negroes that arose when the country learned the story of Doric Miller, a Negro mess, attendant on the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor.
Miller, like all other Negroes in the Navy, was down in the kitchen when the war began. Twenty years ago, after the first “war for democracy” had been won, the Navy decreed that Negroes would hereafter be accepted only as flunkies. Negroes had kept winning promotions and becoming officers and the Navy found it difficult to give them assignments “where the rated Negroes exercised little or no military command.”
Protests against this ruling had little effect. Fifteen sailors on the USS Philadelphia, stationed at Pearl Harbor in the winter of 1940-41, had been discharged from the Navy for writing a letter to a Negro newspaper protesting against their Jim Crow conditions.
But when the bombs began to fall around the ship, Miller came to the deck, seized a machine gun and manned it until it ran out of ammunition, despite the fact that because of his color he had never been taught how to handle such guns; then, as the ship was sinking, he helped rescue a wounded officer. The cry that went up everywhere against the Jim Crow ruling over this succeeded in getting some action out of Roosevelt’s Knox – action which was intended to silence the criticism and yet at the same time continue to deny the Negro sailors the right to serve on the basis of equality with whites.
This writer pointed out a year ago:
“Negroes long clamored for admission into the Air Corps; finally they got – a segregated all-Negro squadron. Negro doctors asked for admission into the Army; they were admitted – but limited to attend to Negro troops. Other branches of the service, such as the Marines and Coast Guard, are still closed to the Negro. If the government should open them, it would be on the same Jim Crow basis as the others.”
Knox’s April 7 order bore out this prediction – what he set up was a separate, Jim Crow section of the Navy, Marines and Coast Guard.
According to this plan, Negroes will be accepted in the “reserve components” of these branches of the service, where they will not be mixed with whites, although serving under white officers; they will be eligible to become petty (non-commissioned) officers, but not commissioned officers. All-Negro crews will be assigned to small craft and to serve around shore establishments and in navy yards; skilled workers among them will be gathered together into labor battalions and may eventually be sent to build bases outside of US continental limits. The plan will begin as soon as Jim Crow training stations can be secured.
This is such an obvious evasion of the demand for Negro equality in the Navy, Marines and Coast Guard that even Randolph attacked it on the ground that “it accepts and extends and consolidates the policy of Jim Crowism in the Navy.” He also said that Negroes should “resent the stigma of inferiority and the status of vassals which Secretary Knox has affixed to them.” Randolph apparently does not realize that he is also condemning himself – for it was his own rotten policy that made possible the extension and consolidation of Jim Crowism by the government.
 
Toward a New Negro Leadership
The conditions of the Negro people are fully as bad as they were a year ago, and the Negro masses are fully aware of the fact. They are ready to take up the militant struggle where it was discontinued last year. Their eagerness for action, indeed, is so great that the Negro misleaders dare not openly counsel them to give up the struggle for equal rights, but must repeat the refrain that “winning the war must come first, and we must not do anything to interfere with the prosecution of the war.” The Negro masses are not interested in interfering with the prosecution of the war, but for them winning the struggle against Jim Crowism comes “first” because they know what is going to be their lot if the war against the Axis is won while the war against Jim Crowism is lost.
The conditions that lead to a renewed struggle, and the sentiments for conducting that struggle, both exist; the only thing lacking is a leadership with a militant program whom the masses would trust and follow. Where are they to find that leadership?
Again Randolph this spring is talking about militant action against discrimination sometime this summer. But this year he will find it much harder to sell himself as the Moses of the Negro people. Randolph won the Springarn medal for outstanding service to the Negro people in 1941 – but the decision to hand him a medal was made by people who shared his policies, not by the Negro masses who were so disgusted by his capitulation to Roosevelt; what they would have voted to give him he wouldn’t have been able to wear. It would be putting it mildly to say that the advanced Negro workers do not trust Randolph and his type. They saw that he made many speeches about how necessary it was to win the “war for democracy” – but was not disposed to grant them any democracy in the movement which they were building at great expense and sacrifice. They’ve heard him make militant speeches before – and they’ve seen him crawl before the Jim Crow forces only a few days later. An index to Randolph’s popularity among the Negro masses can be found in what happened after he called off the march; in the same speech announcing the granting of the “second Emanicipation Proclamation,” he pleaded with the Negro masses to remain in their local committees and to build them; but the masses paid no attention to him – they walked out of the organization the same night they heard about the calling off of the march.
In an interview with the press early this April, Randolph declared that in view of “the continued discriminations against colored Americans in the Army, Navy, US Marine and Air Corps, as well as defense industries” [what an admission about the executive order for which Randolph called off the march! – A.P.], it is necessary that “free, independent and courageous Negro leaders have a frank, candid and plain talk with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt about the whole situation.” Only one short year ago Randolph committed himself in print to the following statements:
“Evidently, the regular, normal and respectable method of conferences and petitions, while proper and ought to be continued as conditions warrant, certainly don’t work. They don’t do the job.”
“Negroes cannot stop discrimination ... with conferences of leaders and the intelligentsia alone. While conferences have merit, they won’t get the desired results by themselves.”
“Power and pressure do not reside in the few, the intelligentsia, they lie in and flow from the masses.”
Whom shall the Negro masses believe – the Randolph of 1941 or the Randolph of 1942 ? Will they accept his story that what is now needed is a frank talk with Roosevelt, when he told them a year ago that such talks could accomplish nothing? Will they believe that their salvation now lies in the local mass meetings he now advocates, at which the part played by them will be limited to listening to Randolph explain about the need for a candid conversation with the president, when he told them a year ago that they had to put up a militant fight if they wanted to get anything, when he told them even after the march was called off that they had secured the executive order only by the threat of the march?
When we speak about Randolph’s policies merging with those of the old-line fakers, we are speaking also of at least 99 per cent of the present leaders of the Negro people – for Randolph still speaks more militantly than most of them.
The Negro masses cannot turn to them for leadership in the coming struggle, nor can they turn to the Communist Party, which has followed a policy since the march was called off fully as treacherous as Randolph and Co. Up until a week before the march was called off, the Stalinists had nothing but criticism for the Randolph leadership because its program did not go far enough, because it did not oppose the war. Then, three days before the executive order was signed, Hitler’s armies invaded the Soviet Union, and the Stalinist policies in the United States underwent a rapid flip-flop. They hailed the executive order as a step forward, although it had, they admitted, some loopholes, and they made no criticism of Randolph for calling off the march. Since then the Stalinists have gone much further along their treacherous road. In February of this year James W. Ford wrote a pamphlet entitled The War and the Negro People, in which he tries to justify the Stalinist policy by saying:
“Four hundred years of Negro slavery are nothing besides Nazi persecution of Jewish peoples, peoples of the occupied countries, and ‘races’ of so-called ‘inferior’ status.”
In March, Eugene Gordon of the Daily Worker editorial staff came out at a symposium in opposition to the Double V slogan of the Pittsburgh Courier (“double victory for democracy at home and abroad”) because, said the Stalinist, “Hitler is the main enemy” and the
“foes of Negro rights in this country should be considered as secondary.” In April, the Stalinist-controlled National Negro Congress was the most enthusiastic congratulator of Knox for his “bold, patriotic action in smashing age-old restrictions” in the Navy. Fortunately, the Stalinists are discredited among Negroes. The Chicago Defender, a Negro paper which had always sympathized with the Stalinist-led Congress, harshly denounced its statement on the Navy Jim Crow setup, saying that its leaders had broken faith with those “who looked to them as among our leaders” and that “they have destroyed their own influence and the influence of the organizations they represent.”
An end to the Negro worker’s acceptance of leadership from outside his own class! In the factories, thanks to the rise of the CIO, are Negro workers trained to represent their fellow-workers. Negroes are serving as grievance committee-men, shop stewards and local union officials, and are in the lead of the struggle in the shops to wipe out Jim Crowism. These Negro trade unionists, thanks to unionism, have developed from their experience the authority of confidence necessary to leaders. From the class struggle in the factories, as well as from their experience of Jim Crowism, they have learned that only the most resolute struggle will win for their people economic, political and social equality. They have helped mightily to build the trade unions and know that the unions are the strongest allies of the Negro struggle. They know that black and white must unite because the white and Negro workers have common problems and a common enemy and must join their forces in common struggle. These Negro proletarian leaders – they are the ones to lead the Negro struggle. When their leadership is recognized and accepted by the great Negro masses – that will be the terrible day of judgment for the Southern Bourbons and their political agents!



As much as any tendency in this country, the Socialist Workers Party has attempted to understand and explain how much the Negro people, although a minority, can accomplish through struggle on their own, alone and unaided if necessary. (See the SWP’s 1963 convention resolution, Freedom Now: The New Stage in the Struggle for Negro Emancipation, and How a Minority Can Change Society.) At the same time we have always believed and stated that in order to win genuine and complete equality the Negroes will need powerful and reliable allies, at home as well as abroad.
But not all alliances are good.
Recognition of this fact is the chief virtue of an article about the problem of Negro-white alliances, The Negro Revolt: The Push Beyond Liberalism, by Sam Bottone in New Politics, Summer, 1964. Bottone is a member of the Socialist Party’s national committee and evidently a member of one of its left wings since he opposed support of Johnson. His views on the Negro struggle are unorthodox in his party; another SP leader, Paul Feldman, attacking Bottone’s position on Johnson in the Oct. 15 New America, needles him this way:
“Does Bottone support the Freedom Now Party? ... His articles on the civil rights movement hover on the brink, but he has not publicly, to my knowledge, taken the plunge.”
“The question of Negro-white alliances,” writes Bottone, “is of vital importance and in the long run, the success of the civil rights movement will hinge on the alliances it develops.” With this we concur, provided that the phrase “in the long run” is not overlooked. He continues:
“Three distinct strategies on this question have begun to emerge: 1) the Negro-labor-liberal alliance is the movement’s most immediate need and must be achieved at almost any cost, even the sacrifice of the movement’s militancy and, if necessary, the weapons [demonstrations, direct action, etc.] which brought it into being; 2) the Negro-labor-liberal alliance is a fraud; the Negro must achieve his freedom by his own efforts, rejecting entangling alliances; 3) the Negro-labor-liberal alliance must be forged on the civil rights movement’s own terms, not by sinking to the level of current liberalism but by pushing the labor movement beyond liberalism.”
Bottone is opposed to Strategies No.1 and 2, and favors No.3. We think we know what he means by No.3, but his formulation is rather confusing. He says he wants a Negro-labor-liberal alliance, but he doesn’t want it at “the level of current liberalism.” Jokes could be made at his expense: Does he want an alliance at the level of past liberalism or future liberalism? Is he silly enough to think that liberalism is capable of becoming its radical opposite, or that if it did, it should still be called liberalism? We doubt that, judging by the generally critical appraisal of liberalism elsewhere in his article.
Then why does he include the liberals in the kind of alliance he favors? What he actually wants, if we read him correctly, is a Negro-labor alliance supported by other sections of the population, with the labor component of that alliance pushed “beyond liberalism,” which is labor’s present ideology. In short, an alliance of the Negro movement with a radicalized labor movement, that is, a labor movement considerably different from the one that now exists. We shall return to this point after considering his remarks about Strategy No.2.
 
Rustin Tendency
On Strategy 1, Bottone is at his best. Here he is writing about the predominant position of his own party, although he refers to it as the “Bayard Rustin tendency.” (It is also essentially the position of the Communist Party, the labor bureaucracy and various middle-class radical groupings.)
Rustin, as Bottone notes, is one of the most influential figures in the civil rights movement. He “has considerable influence with Martin Luther King, Jr., A. Philip Randolph, and sections of CORE and SNCC” (and also the Reuther section of the AFL-CIO bureaucracy, sections of the pacifist movement, etc.) Rustin has “long been identified with militant and radical views,” but he now expresses “a distinct political tendency in the civil rights movement whose appeal is militant and radical in rhetoric, but quite the contrary when put into action ... His views illustrate how seemingly radical conceptions can have a conservative influence and lead away from building and strengthening a militant movement.”
Bottone documents his indictment, showing that on a wide range of incidents and issues Rustin has become a foremost opponent of militant actions that might embarrass or antagonize white liberals and labor leaders. This is hardly a new position in the Negro movement. But Rustin presents it in the following modern, sophisticated, pseudo-radical dress:
The civil rights movement has now gone as far as it can on its own; its economic and social objectives can be won only if fundamental changes are made in society; such changes can be made only through a realignment of the political structure into consistently liberal and conservative parties; and only a Negro-labor-liberal alliance can bring about such a realignment. But you can’t get allies by doing things they don’t like. So you must stop doing such things, and limit yourselves only to things they approve of.
Don’t call this Uncle Tomism, call it Bayard Rustinism. Whatever it’s called, this policy would, in Bottone’s words, disarm the civil rights movement “ideologically in the face of the enemy, who would transform it into a pale appendage of liberalism and the Democratic Party.” Not only would, but has, with few exceptions.
Much less satisfactory is Bottone’s treatment of Strategy No.2 (“the Negro-labor-liberal alliance is a fraud; the Negro must achieve his freedom by his own efforts, avoiding entangling alliances”). This position he attributes to “various separatist and black nationalist tendencies in the Negro movement” and to “‘left’ political tendencies” “operating on their fringes.”
In the first place, the way he presents this position is neither clear nor adequate. If somebody wants to avoid entangling (impeding, obstructive) alliances, does that mean he is opposed to all alliances, to non-entangling alliances?
 
Unrelated Groups
Some Negro tendencies are undoubtedly opposed to all Negro-white alliances now and forever; others are opposed to harmful alliances, like Strategy No. 1, but are open, by implication at least, to other kinds, to useful and helpful alliances, if not now then later. Lumping together different and unrelated groups under Strategy 2 – Black Muslims, Freedom Now Party, Liberator, Socialist Workers Party, Monthly Review, Progressive Labor Movement, Revolutionary Action Movement or RAM, – merely because they have some similarities, may make it easier for Bottone to dismiss them all, but it prevents clarification of the alliance question.
We don’t have room here to discuss all the groups Bottone takes up under Strategy 2. Some of them are really irrelevant; the Muslims do not engage in politics at all, and RAM, in its own ultra-leftist way, similarly has no time for such mundane activity as the Freedom Now Party’s efforts to organize the Negro people in political opposition to the Democratic and Republican parties.
But let us discuss the FNP, which is relevant to the question of political alliances. Bottone locates it “somewhere to the left” of the Muslims as one of the “separatist and black nationalist” groups expressing a new “ideological militancy which rejects integrationist goals as conservative.”
It would have helped if Bottone had defined some of these terms, instead of assuming that everyone accepts the same definitions. For example, what does “separatist” mean to him? That the FNP wants to separate the Negro people into a nation of their own? No unit of the FNP anywhere has taken that position. Does it mean that the FNP seeks to organize the Negroes independently, in their own party? This of course is its primary aim, but independent is a better and more precise word to describe it than separatist. (Bottone seems to feel Negro political “separatism” is bad; does he also think Negro political independence is bad?)
And what does he mean by “reject integrationist goals”? That FNP members are opposed to desegregation of everything everywhere? Or that they do not aim at assimilation into the present society? Desegregation and assimilation are not the same thing, although both words unfortunately are widely used as synonyms for “integration.” If I, or Bottone, fight to end racist segregation and discrimination and at the same time express the belief that Negroes will never get equality in a capitalist society, does that make us rejectors of integrationist goals? Bottone is a long way from clarifying things about the FNP that are closely connected with the question of alliances.
 
FNP Program
This becomes even clearer when he declares, “The program of the Freedom Now Party is ‘radical’: it rejects the existing parties and calls for the nationalization of basic industries.” Bottone is plainly ignorant of the fact that the FNP groups scattered throughout the country have never had a national convention and have never adopted a program. The FNP’s only state convention so far was in Michigan, and all it adopted was a brief, general, state platform, with no reference whatever to nationalization of industry.
The FNP is therefore in an incipient stage, its program still in the process of being worked out and far from being adopted. It doesn’t even call itself radical as yet, although by rejecting the existing parties and proposing a political alternative for the Negro people it surely occupies an objectively radical position in the American political spectrum. (We leave it to Bottone to explain why he insists on using quotation marks around “radical” when he talks of the FNP, as he does when he describes the SWP as “left.”)
Continuing his remarks about the FNP, Bottone says:
“Its focus is on building an organized Negro political power which can pressure the white power structure into granting the Negro economic and cultural freedom. But the FNP rejects any relationship to other social forces in American society, and therefore ends up with the idea that the Negro community, if organized around something like the FNP, has sufficient power to win its demands from a hostile and inherently racist white society. The very nature of this approach pushes the FNP toward separatist solutions.” It is premature, we repeat, to speak of the FNP “ending up” with an idea when it is virtually starting to formulate its program and strategy. Some members may “reject any relationship to other social forces in American society.”
Others don’t; and still others are trying to decide what relationships to other forces are possible, now or in the future, before deciding whether or not to reject them. (Does Bottone really think that Negroes breaking with the capitalist parties, breaking to the left of them, would really reject any relationship to a mass revolutionary working class movement fighting for a program that included the eradication of racism?)
Similarly, some FNP members may be sure that an independently organized Negro community does have the power, by itself, to win its demands from this society; others may not be sure but want to test the validity of this proposition by organizing and fighting and letting the answer be given through the outcome of struggle. (Not at all a bad way to find an answer.) At any rate, nobody knows at this point what the FNP, when constituted on a national basis and with an adopted program, will decide about such questions.
 
All-Negro Party
Bottone isn’t only weak on the facts about the FNP, he is deficient in his grasp of the whole concept. This becomes manifest when he says: “An all-Negro party makes sense only if the movement rejects integrationist goals and seeks economic, political and cultural separation from white society.” But saying so doesn’t make it so. Let us check the correctness of Bottone’s statement about the “only” thing that would make sense of an all-Negro party by imagining we are listening to a discussion between an agitator for a Negro party and another Negro he is trying to convince.

A: We want genuine equality in this country.
B: You mean integration?
A: We don’t mean what they call integration in the North today. We mean full freedom, where we have the same rights and opportunities as anybody else. But call it what you like. To get it, mighty big changes have to be made. Right?
B: Right.
A: But we’ve learned from long and sad experience that the Democrats and Republicans are our enemies, political agents of our oppressors. So we need a new party really dedicated to our freedom. We have also learned from experience that we can’t trust white or white-dominated groups. Very few whites seem to want a new party anyway. So we’ve got to organize ourselves and all other Negroes into a party of our own. That way we can have a party controlled by ourselves and won’t have to worry about it selling us out to the white power structure.
B: Our people have been brain-washed so bad it will be hard convincing them to build such a party.
A: Everything worth doing is hard, but we think it can be done. Why don’t you pitch in and help us?
B: But what are you going to do after you get a lot of Negroes in your party? What can 10 percent of the population do by ourselves?
A: Ten percent can do a lot. In areas where we are a majority, and they are many because of segregated housing, a mass Negro party could elect its own city, county, state and congressional representatives. They wouldn’t owe their election to the Democrats or Republicans but to the black community, so we would control them. For the first time we would have real representatives in office, who could speak and act for us without divided allegiances and without having to get permission from the major parties, the liberals or the labor leaders.
B: But we’d still be a minority. A: Sure, but in a much different and much better position than now. By solidly organizing a decisive part of the Negro community into our own party, we will have some real, undiluted political power for the first time. Meanwhile, the other side will be weaker.
B: What do you mean? A: When Negroes walk out of the Democratic Party, it will be weaker. Without the Negro vote it won’t be the majority party, it won’t be able to win elections, it will begin to come apart. The unions’ ties to the Democrats will be strained and, if it can’t win elections, broken. The whole political structure will be scrambled up merely by our getting together in our own party.
B: But won’t we still be a minority?
A: Yes, but I keep telling you, we’ll be in a better position than ever before because we will have some real political power, which we’ll be able to use for bargaining and negotiating purposes.
B: Bargaining and negotiating with whom?
A: With any “other social forces” that are willing to work together with us on our “own terms,” formally or informally, temporarily or permanently.

* * *
Doesn’t this concept of an all-Negro party, which is held and has been expressed by at least some FNP members, make as much “sense” as Bottone’s dictum that such a party must reject integrationist goals and seek separation? We are not saying that this concept will or should shape the strategy ultimately decided on by the FNP forces; we are saying only that it is perfectly compatible with the organization of an all-black party. Bottone is a prisoner of rigid, formalistic, undialectical categories. (“Integration” through “separation” seems impossible where thinking is frozen this way.) This becomes painfully clear when Bottone discusses the organizational structure of the political alliance needed to destroy racism in this country. He says:
“The civil rights movement must express itself through a political party which fights uncompromisingly for its goals, a party free of ties to status quo forces. This is not and cannot be the Democratic Party. Nor can it be, as some have proposed, an all-Negro party. It must be a party which all working people can support and in which they can participate actively and democratically; a party which translates the demands of the civil rights movement in a broad economic and social program which will shape and guide the future of the entire nation.”
On the whole, very good. We have only one but. Why must there be a political party, one political party and only one, to accomplish what he wants? Who has ordained, on earth or in heaven, that this job can be done only by one party? Why can’t there be two or more than two parties, an alliance of parties as well as of social forces – and why can’t one of these be a party built by the Negro people, having their confidence, and maintained by them as a safeguard against sellout until such time as they no longer need fear one?
 
Unions Default
If the union movement had done its job 25 years or even 10 years ago, if it had created an independent labor party fully committed among other things to the struggle for Negro equality, then it is possible, even likely, that the Negro people would have flocked to its banner as they did to the CIO in its early days, and the question of a black party might never have come up historically. But the unions defaulted, they clung to the Democratic Party, they did everything they could to keep the Negroes in the same trap. And they are still doing this today.
That is why the FNP arose and strives to become a national party. It may turn out that the FNP, through its example of independence and through the effects it will have on the Democratic-labor coalition if it is successful in tearing the Negroes away from that coalition, will be a major factor stimulating the unions into long-overdue entry onto the road of independent labor political action. This surely is not a logical impossibility.
Bottone’s Strategy 3, if we interpreted it correctly as well as charitably, calls for a Negro alliance with a radicalized labor movement, attracting the support of other forces willing to accept the leadership of that kind of alliance. But there is no such labor movement yet, unfortunately. The labor movement today is not pushed “beyond liberalism,” but stuck deep in the quagmire of liberalism. So what does Bottone advise militant Negroes to do in this situation?
Does he advise them to WAIT, to wait politically until the labor movement begins to move? That of course is what the liberals in and out of the labor movement advise and insist. Or does he advise the Negroes to go ahead and organize themselves politically?
That is just what the FNP is trying to do, at a time when strong and acceptable allies are not in sight. If he can unfreeze his thinking a little, Bottone surely should be able to see that the organization of a mass FNP, disrupting the present coalition around the Democratic Party, is precisely one of the factors that will push the labor movement beyond liberalism and toward the kind of alliance he wants.
One of the most encouraging developments of recent years has been the way some Negroes have freed themselves from fetishes about “separation,” “integration,” “two-party system,” etc. The result has been the unleashing of political creativity and initiative, which this country so badly needs. It is time for white radicals to overcome their fear of being ridiculed as white “black nationalists” and get rid of some fetishes of their own. The result here too would be refreshing and productive all along the line.



“Recommendations of the Army’s GI gripe board for narrowing the gap between officers and enlisted men were applauded by GIs here today but many said the plan would never be put into effect – the brass would kill it.” That reaction, recorded in a May 28 AP dispatch from Tokyo, was undoubtedly shared by millions of veterans and servicemen all over the world.
These men, who know from their own unpleasant experiences what an undemocratic institution the Army is, agree with many of the specific recommendations of the War Department’s Doolittle Board, especially those calling for greater equality between officers and enlisted men in pay, living accommodations, food rations, travel allowances, treatment in military trials, privilege to accumulate furlough time and terminal leave pay, etc. They naturally agree with them because all through the war, whenever they had any freedom of expression, they themselves called for these and similar reforms.
 
Cause of Suspicion
But the veterans of World War II also know how little they can rely on the War Department and the General staff to make any real reforms in the caste-system of the Army.
When they were in the Army, they had a long experience with “eyewash” – Army measures and policies which look good on paper, which draw favorable comment from the generally uninformed public, but which are not observed in practice. That is why they are suspicious and cynical.
And they have every right to be. When the contents of the Doolittle Board report were made public, the press related that “there were guarded indications that the War Department was not upset by the findings,” and even that the report on the whole was “well received” by the high brass. There were three chief reasons for this:

The War Department and the general staff were treated with 	kid gloves in a report which was supposed to summarize the soldiers’ 	complaints against the Army. On the whole, the Board said, the Army 	“did a truly magnificent job,” and the blame lay with 	“undeniably poor leadership on the part of a small percentage 	of those in positions of responsibility.” Under present 	conditions, when so many veterans are free to tell the truth about 	the Army, what general could ask for anything more in the way of a 	whitewash job?
 

No Commitments

The report, well-larded with high-sounding generalities about 	“full recognition of the dignity of man,” did not commit 	the War Department to anything. Secretary of War Patterson promised 	only that the report would be studied further and that “additional 	steps will be taken as may be indicated and possible.” Even 	the most insignificant recommendation that officers and enlisted men 	wear the same uniform – which was decided on by the War 	Department months ago, will not go into effect until the middle of 	1948.
 
At the same time and at no cost to itself the War Department 	has received a lot of favorable publicity implying that it is 	seriously interested in improving conditions of the enlisted men. 	This is the most important consideration – and the main reason 	for the establishment of the Doolittle Board – because it will 	help Army recruitment and at the same time soften some of the 	opposition to peacetime conscription.
 

Support Reforms
Veterans, veteran organizations and the labor movement should support most of the Doolittle Board’s recommendations, no matter why they were made. And the more hesitant the War Department shows itself, the more vigorously they should demand their immediate adoption. But at the same time they must be aware of the extremely limited, inadequate and therefore unsatisfactory nature of these recommendations.
For while these recommendations will help reduce some of the more glaring differences between the living conditions of officers and enlisted men, they will by no means eliminate the caste system itself. And the adoption of every one of these recommendations will not change the fundamentally undemocratic structure of the army in any respect.
When we say that the Army is undemocratic, it is not only because officers enjoy privileges denied to enlisted men. it is above all because the enlisted man, when he is given a uniform, is simultaneously deprived of the democratic rights which are recognized as his in civilian life. Deprived of the protection of these rights, he is as much at the mercy of the military hierarchy as a German worker was under Hitler (or is today under the occupation authorities). And this is true, no matter how much the officers get paid or what kind of uniform they wear.
 
Democratic Rights
Among the most elementary of the rights taken away from the soldiers are the right of free speech and free press, the right of petition and assembly, the right to serve on military juries, the right to elect committees to present grievances. Under present regulations, for example, a soldier cannot – without specific authorization from the War Department – even write his Congressman to urge his support of legislation incorporating the recommendations of the Doolittle Board!
Without these rights, you cannot even speak of a democratic army. And since the servicemen are muzzled, it is up to the veterans and the labor movement to take the initiative in an aggressive fight to revise the military code for the. purpose of really democratizing the armed forces.
 



Last month the Doolittle Board issued a report recommending the elimination of some of the differences in living conditions and privileges between officers and enlisted men. The War Department, which had appointed the Board, shrugged its shoulders in contempt when the report was issued.
Now Hanson W. Baldwin, military editor of the N.Y. Times and unofficial spokesman for the big brass, has come out with a blistering attack charging that adoption of the Doolittle Board’s report would turn the Army into “an armed mob.”
The Board had favored among other things “social fraternization” between officers and enlisted men, and had discussed without recommendation possible abolition of the “official gap or line of demarcation between the so-called officer and enlisted groups.”
“These are dangerous suggestions,” Baldwin shrieked on June 12. “... An officer corps must be the heart and soul of any army. Abolish it, minimize its importance, try to merge it with enlisted ranks and you have no army.”
To prove this point, Baldwin refers to historical precedent – the Red Army. Since this same point is made in the Doolittle report, and was recently emphasized in articles by officers in Collier’s and the Saturday Evening Post, it is worth examining here:
“The Russians tried it, and for years there were no titles, no real badges of rank, no salutes and no distinction between officer and enlisted man in the Red Army,” Baldwin continues. “These regulations and the political commissars made the pre-war Russian Army an armed mob and cost Russia dearly in the first Finnish campaign and in the first years of the struggle against Germany.”
It is time this widely spread myth was punctured. The Red Army regulations abolishing the privileges of the officers had nothing whatever to do with the results in the Finnish war. That war took place in 1939–40. But the regulations referred to with such horror by Baldwin were rescinded as far back as 1935, when the reactionary Stalin bureaucracy restored the officer corps, and all the special officer privileges and rank which Baldwin thinks is so necessary for an army.
When the Red Army went into the second world war, it was hard to distinguish, so far as officer-enlisted men regulations were concerned, between it and the U.S. or German armies. And yet it suffered serious defeats in the first stage of the war.
Can’t Baldwin’s historical example thus be turned against him? For in the Red Army’s early days, under Lenin and Trotsky, when it was the most democratic army and had the highest morale in the world, this army succeeded in defeating the efforts of all the imperialist armies to destroy the Russian Revolution.
 
The Use of Rank
How can you have an effective army when you remove these “incentives to leadership,” that is, officer privileges, Baldwin demands? Leon Trotsky, founder of the Red Army, answered this question 10 years ago when he denounced Stalin’s restoration of the officer corps:
“The restoration of hierarchical caste is not in the least demanded by the interests of military affairs. It is the commanding position, and not the rank, of the commander that is important. Engineers and physicians have no rank, but society finds the means of putting each in his needful place.
“The right to a commanding position is guaranteed by study, endowment, character, experience, which need continual and moreover individual appraisal. The rank of major adds nothing to the commander of a battalion. The elevation of the five senior commanders of the Red Army to the title of marshal gives them neither new talents nor supplementary powers.
“It is not the army that really thus receives a ‘stable basis,’ but the officers’ corps, and that at the price of aloofness from the army. The reform pursues a purely political aim: to give a new social weight to the officers ...” (The Revolution Betrayed, Pioneer Publishers)
 



More purges are on the order of the day in the Soviet Union, and they are coming – if they have not already begun – in the armed forces of the USSR. That is the political conclusion to be drawn from the new disciplinary code for the Red Army, Navy and Air Force signed by Stalin and reported by the official army newspaper Red Star on June 19.
The new code, according to this paper, has the following special features:

Even more rigorous military discipline than in the past, with 	greater emphasis on saluting, etc., with an injunction to officers 	that “not a single offense or act of misconduct by 	subordinates should go unnoticed.”
 
The necessity and duty to report to the highest officials 	“the stealing or wasting of military property, unlawful 	spending of money or any misconduct in handling food supplies to 	troops” and “insubordinate acts that are lessening the 	military efficiency of the armed forces.”
 
The establishment of special “officers’ courts of 	honor which are created to preserve the dignity and honor of the 	officers’ rank.” These courts will rule on breaches of 	discipline unworthy of officers and contrary to the “understanding 	of the ethics and morality in the Red Army.”

How does it happen that after the war, after the Red Army has been hailed as the savior of the Soviet Union, it is discovered that stricter discipline is needed for peace time?
There can be only one answer: This stricter discipline is not needed to strengthen the Red Army, but to strengthen the bureaucratic grip over the Red Army, which the Kremlin had to relax somewhat during the war.
A rift must be taking place between the Stalinist bureaucracy and a section of the officer caste.
If this was not the case, Stalin would not take the grave step of in effect publicly reprimanding the officers and implying they have been guilty of military offenses.
The new code is a warning to the officers. At the same time under cover of talk about embezzlement, corruption and insubordination, it prepares Soviet public opinion for a general assault against all oppositional elements in the armed forces.
 
Potential Victims
That some of the victims of this new purge will be pro-capitalist elements in the officer corps may be taken for granted. There are such elements, reflecting primarily the growth of a pro-capitalist peasantry in the countryside, whose development is reported elsewhere on this page in the article by Ernest Germain. During the war they were encouraged and rewarded by Stalin himself, and it is quite likely that their influence has grown sufficiently to make them appear dangerous to the Kremlin.
But they will not be the only victims. It has always been a favorite Stalinist device to utilize the crimes and blunders of the bureaucracy or its pro-capitalist allies as a pretext for launching purges which wipe out opposition trends of all kinds. The bureaucracy can be expected in the new purge to strike also – and must brutally – at critics from the left (in the army) those who are discontented with the nationalist counter-revolutionary course of Stalinism and want to return to the program of Leninism.
At any rate the new code, like the purges it foreshadows, is a manifestation of the fact that the Stalin regime remains a regime of crisis. None of Stalin’s problems inside the Soviet Union have been solved by the war. On the eve of the war he had to carry through widespread and repeated purges in the army, decimating its leadership over and over again. Now at the termination of the war the same process is renewed.
Like all totalitarian dictatorships, the Stalin regime dares not permit the slightest sign of opposition and its only answer to discontent is new bloodbaths. These purges are a sign of the mortal weakness of the regime and its lack of support from the masses.
 



A slight shift to the right took place in the French and Italian elections of June 2. In both countries, for the first time since the end of the war, a capitalist party came forward as the largest in the electoral field. But in each case this capitalist party still remains a minority. France and Italy remain in the grip of a political crisis; in both countries the parliamentary scene will be marked by instability for the coming period. The decisive battles still lie ahead.
In the elections to the French Constituent Assembly, which will prepare a new constitution, the Communist Party held its own, even adding slightly to its popular vote, but losing 4 or 5 seats in the Assembly. The Socialist Party lost both seats and votes, falling back to the position of third party. Together the two parties still represent a majority, but now by only one or two seats; their combined relative strength has declined.
The chief gains were made by the Popular Republican Movement (MRP), which added over a million votes and about 15 seats in the Assembly. The MRP, whose strength was an unknown factor only last October, has emerged as the main party and rallying center of the French capitalist class.
In the Italian referendum on the monarchy and election of a Constituent Assembly, a similar trend was revealed. The House of Savoy was rejected by roughly twelve million to ten million votes. The Christian Democrats, who resemble the French MRP, received over one-third of the votes. The Socialist and Communist Party each got about 20 per cent.
What is the explanation for the rise and growth of the MRP (and its “Christian Socialist” counterparts not only in Italy, but in Germany, Austria, and several other countries in western Europe)?
It must be remembered, that the capitalist parties on the continent were completely discredited and lost all semblance of mass support during the war. When the German occupation ended, the capitalists did not have a single party of their own. They had to begin all over again and build them. Capitalism remained dominant not because of the strength of the capitalists, but because the Communist and Socialist Parties, supported by the masses who wanted a revolutionary change, refused to overthrow it.
 
Capitalist Aims
But the capitalists were not and are not satisfied to rule through these workers’ parties, subservient though their leaders are. For the continuation of rule in this manner implies some concessions to the masses; furthermore, it contains the danger that the workers’ organizations, under a different leadership, may move toward the overthrow of capitalism. The stabilization of the ruined French economy under capitalism can be achieved only by further attacks on the masses’ living standards and rights. To carry this out completely, the capitalists must have agents more trustworthy and less subject to mass pressure than the Stalinist and “Socialist” leaders. For the perspective of French capitalism is not rule by “democratic” forms but by a dictatorial regime which can repress all independent activity of the masses.
Of course the capitalists could not make this change overnight – the political conditions were not ripe for it. First of all they needed a party of their own. So, while they were rebuilding the shattered structure of the capitalist state with the aid of the workers parties’ leaders, they began to prepare for the future by organizing the MRP. To help it secure a mass base, even among the lower middle class, they had to give it a radical hue. The MRP declared for nationalization of industry, for example, and in many other ways took the coloration of the workers’ parties.
 
October Election
The MRP made a strong beginning in the first postwar election last October, but it was still only the third largest party. De Gaulle, who represented one wing of the MRP, thought the time had come early this year for beginning the anti-labor offensive, but the capitalists generally judged more time was required. De Gaulle was compelled to step down from the government until a more favorable occasion.
The MRP got all the help the ruling class could give it, but no one aided it more effectively than the leaders of the CP and SP. Instead of exposing the true aims of the MRP, the leaders of these parties – who constituted a majority of the government – entered into a coalition with the MRP and thus helped to build up its authority. Instead of offering a truly revolutionary program to inspire the workers, peasants and middle class, the CP and SP sponsored measures which the MRP could support and go along with.
As the Republican columnist, Walter Lippman, points out with satisfaction: “The Communists have no social program for the reconstruction of France which is more advanced or more radical than that which the MRP and the Socialists offer.”
Furthermore, the CP and SP vied with the MRP, and even surpassed it, in such measures as disarming the workers, prohibiting strikes, increasing the speedup, maintaining wage-freezing, etc. Little wonder, therefore, that large sections of the masses have become confused, discouraged and even fallen into apathy.
 
MRP Benefits
That the MRP was able to benefit from such conditions was shown in the next balloting – the May 5 referendum on the constitution. Here, by cleverly seizing on a secondary though important difference with the other two parties, the MRP was able to get credit for being an opposition to the Gouin government, thus partly obscuring the fact that it shared responsibility for all the unpopular measures of that government.
As a Paris dispatch to The Militant two weeks ago indicated. the MRP was able to win in this test of strength because of “the abstention, if not the direct opposition, of a considerable section of the lowest strata of the population.” In four of the industrial departments, the vote in favor of the constitution was more than 200,000 less than the vote cast for the CP and SP together last October. (A typographical error in the June 1 Militant made this read 2,000,000 instead of 200,000; but this does not alter the significance of the decline in the CP-SP vote.)
The June 2 election shows that this trend, in a modified form, is continuing.
The capitalists in Italy and France can thank the CP and SP not only for maintaining capitalism in its darkest days, but also for assisting in the creation of strong and growing capitalist parties.
As a result the political forces of French capitalism are today stronger comparatively than at any time since the collapse of Germany. But even now they are not in the position they aim to secure. The social crisis remains unresolved.
 



During the last few months there has been considerable discussion in the press about the officer caste system. In an effort to attract recruits, the army has even set up a board which will soon make recommendations for eliminating some of the more glaringly outrageous aspects of the caste system. This inevitably reminds me of Captain Flick, our commanding officer overseas – the most typical, the most officer-like of all I encountered.
Captain Flick had been in the Officer Reserve Corps in peacetime; had signed up while at school, got a smattering of military training, and in due course took his place with the other officers and gentlemen by act of Congress. We came overseas and joined his outfit in England about a week before D-Day. Ours was a battalion headquarters; he was commander of the headquarters detachment, battalion adjutant, summary court officer, etc. We didn’t pay much attention to him at first because everything was so strange to us and because we were supposed to go to France on D-Day plus five.
 
Situation Normal
The invasion situation was normal, and we got across the channel only three days later than we were supposed to. When we got within landing distance early in the afternoon, there was no landing craft available and no one seemed to know where we should go, so we stayed on the ship all night. That proved unwise because when it got dark some German planes began dropping bombs on the ships in that area.
At the height of this activity, when we were beginning to appreciate the thoughts of a sitting duck, Captain Flick appeared among us, looking for something, and shining a flashlight in such a way as to inspire gratitude in the German bombardiers. We frankly told him what to do and where to go. After that, we watched him a little more closely.
When we got off at Omaha Beach the next day. Captain Flick was given the job of taking us to our bivouac area. With what we later recognized to be unerring inaccuracy he led us to the east instead of the west, so that it was night by the time we got to the area, and we had to dig ourselves in in the dark.
The situation remained normal and nobody knew what to do with our outfit for a couple of days after we got there. So we began to dig ourselves bigger and better foxholes. Such activity was unbecoming the dignity of a gentleman. Captain Flick ordered one of our medics to do his digging, and, not having anything else to do himself, stood by and gave directions while taking a sun-bath. Someone with a camera came by, taking human interest pictures. The captain ordered the medic to halt, took the shovel from him, assumed a position in the hole and had his picture taken. Then he got out and ordered the medic to resume work.
Some months later Captain Flick was interviewed by a radio broadcaster he knew back home and his remarks, suitably vague, made it seem he was one of the chief reasons why the invasion had been successful. Actually, Captain Flick’s chief activity during the crucial weeks of the Normandy campaign was court-martialing soldiers for firing their carbines at night without visibly good reason.
In private Captain Flick demurred weakly to the battalion commander that you couldn’t court-martial men and fine them for firing their weapons in a combat area, but the colonel didn’t see it that way. And so Captain Flick, “like a good soldier,” obediently carried out the summary courts-martial and made several hundreds of dollars for his government.
An enlisted man with charges against him by an officer never had a chance with Captain Flick. He was all for “upholding discipline.” He even court-martialed one of the members of our own detachment, a young medic who had got drunk for the first time in his life, Captain Flick threw the book at him – discipline must be maintained at all costs. But when later one of our officers, heavily drunk, broke a chair over the head of an enlisted man in a quarrel over a French girl, there was no court martial. A month later the offending officer was just transferred to another outfit and a better job.
Captain Flick was frank about some things. He called the enlisted men “the hired help” and treated them accordingly. He used to say: “You know the hired help is supposed to do all the work around here. Us officers – we’re just supposed to tell you what to do.”
His social outlook was not very broad. He never read anything but picture magazines and comic books. He used to go out of his way to embarrass one of the Catholic enlisted men, who was very devout, with questions which must have seemed amusing among the Ku Klux Klan. Behind their backs he was always making cracks about the Jews. He had been born in the South and had the traditional cracker attitude toward the Negro soldiers. As for the French people – they were dirty foreigners who spoke a repulsive and incomprehensible language and who were responsible for everything that had happened to them and no good for anything but sexual intercourse anyhow.
 
Stood on Rank
Toward enlisted men Captain Flick was often rude. Even with his junior officers he often stood on his rank. One of these contradicted him about some minor matter once and Captain Flick’s face got red. He drew himself up and said: “You want to remember that you’re talking to a captain of the United States Army.” “Yes, sir.” “And I’m due the respect of such.” “Yes, sir ”
But toward his senior officers he was generally obsequious and timid. One time a general was supposed to come to inspect our quarters and there weren’t many enlisted men around to clean the place up. That was the only time in 18 months I saw Captain Flick do a lick of work.
Somehow or other Captain Flick had got a college diploma. But his education wasn’t such as to inspire confidence in his judgment. One time we went in a convoy from Normandy to Le Mans, by way of the ruins of St. Lo. Captain Flick was at the head of the convoy, directing it. We went off a main road and considerably out of our way. Finally we got lost, although it seemed a difficult thing to do.
We asked Captain Flick why he hadn’t continued to follow the signs pointing to St. Lo. “Because I didn’t see any,” he answered. But, we said, every one else had seen them, and we turned back and showed him where they had been. “Why, I saw those signs,” he admitted, “but I always thought Lo was spelled L-o-w.”
Captain Flick fascinated me. He seemed to personify most of the officers I came across. I used to promise myself that some day I would write a semi-fictional story about an officer like him, finishing it off ironically with an account of his promotion to the rank of major. But toward the end of the war Captain Flick was promoted to major. That took the taste out of the project for me.
He went home around Thanksgiving, 1945, and we heard that he had reenlisted for another year. Where else but in the army can a man of his qualities get a job that automatically commands not only good pay – but “respect” as well?
 



The Good Soldier Schweik
by Jaroslav Hasek
Doubleday, Doran and Co., 1930.
Everyone who likes a good book should read The Good Soldier Schweik, and World War II veterans especially. Written over 20 years ago, it still remains the best all-round satiric novel – and the most biting condemnation – of modern capitalist militarism available in English. And although it is about the Austrian Army in World War I, every American veteran of the more recent war will immediately recognize its incidents and characters, especially the officers.
Schweik was a Czech, drafted into the Austrian Army. Like the Sad Sack, Schweik was always getting into trouble, but unlike the Sad Sack and because he knew what military service was, he always managed somehow to escape the harsh fate meted out to his more careful companions. Schweik had been in the army in peacetime but had been discharged as an imbecile. Every once in a while you get to thinking that he really is an imbecile; but before long you begin to wonder, because one thing is sure – Schweik isn’t as crazy as the army is.
The author follows Schweik from his arrest at the beginning of the war as a suspicious character because of some innocent statements made in a saloon, through prison and an amazing psychiatric examination (one doctor asks: “Is radium heavier than lead?”) up to his induction into the army.
Because he has rheumatism, Schweik is sent to a hospital for malingerers and then detention barracks, reminiscent of the Lichfield guardhouse of more recent fame. Here the sergeant-major complains bitterly about having had to trample on some prisoner for 10 minutes before his ribs began to crack; and another non-com warns Schweik that if he is ever questioned during an inspection, he must stand at attention, salute and answer: “I beg to report, sir, no complaints, and I’m quite satisfied.”
Schweik is released from detention to become the orderly of a generally drunk chaplain fond of commanding, “Any of you who are dead must report themselves to headquarters within three days, so that their corpses can be consecrated.” But the chaplain loses Schweik to a lieutenant in a card game, and Schweik gets his new superior into trouble with their colonel, so both are shipped off to the front. At the end Schweik is captured – by soldiers of his own army.
The author, Hasek, was himself a Czech draftee in the Austrian Army and a prisoner of war of the Russians. There, I was told in Europe, he came under the influence of the Russian Revolution and became a supporter of the Bolsheviks. The Good Soldier Schweik was planned for six books; Hasek wrote only four before his death in 1923; a friend completed the other two along lines indicated in his notes. The American edition includes only the first three of Hasek’s books. A publisher who wants to do the public a good turn should print the whole work.
Early this year Penguin Books issued a 25 cent edition of the original American edition, but unfortunately it is abridged. The original edition is available in most public libraries.
 



A sweeping indictment of American “military justice” in World War II was made last week in a report by a sub-committee of the House Military Affairs Committee, the full contents of which have not yet been made public as a result of pressure from the War Department.
The report, drawn up after a six-month investigation, in effect charged the Army with conducting courts-martial in order to maintain the officers’ concept of “discipline” rather than to dispense justice:
“The court-martial system is regarded by most professional officers as a means of enforcing discipline ... (but) discipline must not be named as a cloak to cover arbitrariness and injustice.”
(Recently Major General Thomas H. Green, Judge Advocate General, in a defense of the court-martial system before the American Bar Association in Cincinnati, declared: “The court-martial system is, of course, primarily designed to help our armies win our wars. The sanctions of military justice constitute an instrument of command. They form the strong right arm of the military commander in the maintenance of order and discipline within his ranks.”)
 
Compliant Courts
“There is a widespread belief among intelligent soldiers that not so much a qualified as a weak and compliant court has been the objective,” the House committee report continued. A weak and compliant court is naturally more apt to obey the wishes of the senior officer who appointed its members and who can make life miserable for them after the trial.
“There have been many excessive sentences ... the most tragic, of course, are the death sentences not commuted (142 in number), about which it is so difficult to obtain information ... Army courts in Europe adjudged two sentences of life imprisonment for A.W.O.L. Hundreds, probably thousands of bewildered boys with no really disloyal intentions were sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for absence without leave ... It is the opinion of competent observers that Army sentences generally err on the side of severity.”
In addition, it declared, the War Department does not provide “adequate review of their findings” since the record shows that sentences imposed were approved by a 99-to-one ratio by the Judge Advocate General’s office.
As in all other spheres of Army life, officers get different and more favorable treatment than enlisted men facing the same charges. In Manila the Army issued orders to arrest all speed law violators. Enlisted men were fined on the first offense, it said, but officers were not punished until the third offense – and then got off with a reprimand in place of a fine.
”An enlisted man has the right, to bring charges against a commissioned officer,” the report observed. “This is largely a paper provision. An officer of long experience has said that when it did happen the enlisted man always found himself court-martialed or transferred.”
Officers Select Court
But, as every soldier knows, an officer not only can bring charges against an enlisted man, but he can often also select the members of the court-martial. Of course his testimony bears ten times more weight with the court than the enlisted man’s.
In addition to its general observations, the sub-committee presented 16 specific recommendations. But the adoption of these recommendations – which is not likely, since the War Department is preparing its own list of proposed “reforms” – will do little to change the situation fundamentally.
The sub-committee calls for amendments to some of the present Articles of War, when the need is for the complete abolition of this barbarous military code and the adoption of a code which will – recognize the democratic rights of members of the armed forces. It asks for an independent tribunal that will more thoroughly review the harshest courts-martial sentences, but is willing to leave the courts-martial themselves in the hands of the officer caste.
It seeks to give enlisted men on trial the right to have one-third of the court composed of enlisted men. This would be a change from the present system where only officers sit on juries, but would still be a far cry from the right of trial by a jury of one’s peers, which enlisted men asked for again and again in their letters to army newspapers during the recent war.
 
Recommendations Useless
The value of the sub-committee’s report lies in what it reports, and not in what it recommends. After all, Congress does not come into this matter with clean hands. After the first world war a similar report was made by a Congressional committee, and nothing came of it but a few face-saving amendments to the Articles of War. And Congress has the right to replace the Articles of War with a whole new code. Basically, as the record shows, all Congress wants to do is prevent scandals, not interfere with the power of the officer caste.
In spite of this. Undersecretary of War Royall challenged the report as “grossly unfair both to the Army and the system of military justice.” To defend the War Department he pointed out it had appointed an advisory board on military justice, with its members selected by the American Bar Association, to review the entire court-martial procedure. (This was done after the House sub-committee had begun its investigation. Furthermore, American Bar Association members helped the War Department whitewash the Articles of War after World War I.) Royall also called attention to the fact that a clemency board had been set up last summer “to review every individual general court-martial case.”
But as the House report said: “Neither clemency nor pardon are remedies for miscarriages of justice.”
 



Readers of The Militant are already acquainted with the main facts about the Lichfield trials; with the reports of brutal beatings and sadistic treatment of American prisoners – many of them wounded and decorated combat soldiers – at the Army’s Tenth Reinforcement Depot guardhouse in England; with the proceedings of the first two courts-martial, which ended in the conviction of two sergeants. Even the capitalist press is finally beginning to give a little space to these atrocities (along with the much greater space they give to advertisements seeking enlistments in the armed forces).
These facts have given rise to certain questions which must be answered before one can see the Lichfield case in its proper perspective:
What is the Army’s aim in holding these trials? Does it want to really punish the guilty parties? Does it aim by these trials to prevent similar brutality elsewhere?
The first thing to remember is that the Army was in no hurry to prosecute this case. The Inspector General’s Department was acquainted with the facts for almost a year before the first court martial was convened. During this war thousands of soldiers were charged, tried, convicted and sentenced in a week or two on far less evidence than was available in the Lichfield case. One can therefore say that the Army appeared strangely reluctant to even bring the case to trial at all.
But in a certain sense it could not help itself. Lichfield and the methods employed there were notorious throughout the Army in Western Europe. I, who was never near Lichfield, heard about it in France almost a year before the trials began, and so did hundreds of thousands of other troops. (Interest in it was so great in the ETO that the Army paper Stars and Stripes was often compelled to feature news of the first trial ahead of the Nuremberg “war criminals” trial which began around the same time.) When the war ended in Europe, many soldiers acquainted with the story had gone home and spread it further.
The Army was thus faced with an unwelcome choice: Take the chance of perhaps letting it get to a Congressional committee and having an investigation by some outside body – or of proceeding on its own and trying to make the best of a bad business. Its hand was forced, and naturally it took the second course.
But the Army did not intend to do more than make a facesaving gesture. This was demonstrated beyond any possibility of doubt when it confined its charges to a number of enlisted men and the two junior officers at the Lichfield guardhouse. One of them was admittedly a psychoneurotic, the otb«r a lieutenant who had so disliked his job there that he made repeated efforts to be transferred to some other post. It omitted charging the commanding officer, Col. James A. Kilian, who was responsible for setting the guardhouse policy. It was demonstrated again in the middle of the first trial when the War Department had to withdraw its recommendation to the Senate of a promotion for this same Kilian, although the War Department had known the facts about Lichfield long before it submitted this recommendation.
Kilian and some of the other officers at Lichfield are now also facing trial. This happened because the Lichfield guards, who had been perjuring themselves at the beginning of the trial on Kilian’s orders, began to tell some of the truth after they saw their case was hopeless. But even after Kilian was charged, a member of the Western Base Section general staff contacted the enlisted defendants and tried to make an out-of-court deal favorable to the officers. If Kilian faces trial, it is not because the Army wanted it but because Kilian’s conspiracy to silence the guards could not survive the testimony of soldiers who had been beaten at his orders.
On top of this it must be remembered that the Army has shown no intention of going higher than Kilian – of investigating, for example, the eight generals who in one month inspected the Lichfield guardhouse at the time of the atrocities and found it very satisfactory – of inquiring, for another example, into the statement to a guard by Major General Brown, commander of the Ground Forces Reinforcement Command: “You’re not tough enough on these men. You’re not running a hotel, sergeant.”
This leads to another series of questions: Was Lichfield unique? Was it an exception in the Army? Were other guardhouses, stockades and detention centers operated on other, more humanitarian principles?
To these questions it is possible to answer with a categoric No! Lt. Granville Cubage, one of the junior officer defendants, testified that Kilian had told him Lichfield could be “as tough as any DTC” (Disciplinary Training Center).
The defense counsel asked him: “Did other DTCs use methods similar to Lichfield that the guards at Lichfield might have been aware of, supporting their belief that they were carrying out a legal order?” To which Cubage replied:
“Yes. When I took prisoners from Lichfield to the DTCs, I took guards with me from Lichfield ... The commandant at DTC 2913 at Langford, England, for instance, took myself and the guards through their solitary confinement cells in October, 1944, and showed us the punishment the men got there ... Also when we returned from DTC 3 at Sudbury, England, I told our guards that the commandant there had told me his men used clubs for beating prisoners. I told the men that at Langford they had a dungeon far below ground, you couldn’t see the light and the officer in charge laughingly told me that occasionally someone fell down these stairs on his face.”
Here is some additional evidence from George Fielding Eliot, military commentator of the N.Y. Herald-Tribune:
“... there is strong reason to believe that Lichfield is only one among many. There are too many other reports of similar tenor from other parts of the world where American soldiers have been serving to make it possible to think that the conditions at Lichfield were exceptional. Bitter stories come back by various means – stories of the ‘Black Hole’ of Le Mans, stories of men staked out naked in the African sun at the detention center of Casablanca, stories of men ‘on the rock pile’ in the Pacific theater, stories of clubbings, stringing up by the thumbs, of worse – and nameless – brutalities practiced by American soldiers.” (Feb. 2, 1946)
Surely the Army, equipped with an Inspector General’s Department whose job is supposed to be the investigation of all “irregularities,” knows as much about these hell-holes as Eliot. Yet no one anywhere has heard any plans for courts-martial involving them. Why?
The truth of the matter is that the Army has something to conceal – and that is its own policy. Eliot, whose only fear is that the Army may go too far and thus discredit itself, admits the existence of a policy:
”There seems to have been a consistent Army policy to make detention so dreaded that men would avoid it like a plague ...”
And his counterpart on the N.Y. Times, Hanson W. Baldwin, who apologizes for the Lichfield brutalities on the grounds of military necessity – that old alibi used to cover up most crimes and blunders in wartime – also admits there was a policy; even calls it official: “... the men on trial (with definite exceptions) probably are not so much the sadists they have been pictured as executors of an official Army policy of toughness ...” (April 24)
Any conclusion of the Lichfield case which does not bring the indictment, trial and destruction of this Army policy will expose the Lichfield courts-martial as a whitewash, no matter what happens to the individual defendants.
 




The Army Is the Boss!
Roosevelt knows how to put over his policy of Jim Crowism in the armed forces in a smooth and polished manner, but not all his assistants have the same experience and technique that he has. They often bungle and show the truth of the situation which his sweet words cover up.
For example, take the case of Brigadier General Hershey of the Selective Service Administration, one of the men in charge of the draft.
When he was asked in a recent interview how it happened that the administration was segregating colored soldiers and sailors when the Selective Service Act had a provision prohibiting racial discrimination in the armed forces, he replied:
“The act says there is to be no discrimination, the act also says that no man may come into the army who is not acceptable to the army. The navy, of course, is worse, and the marines will not accept colored applicants. I regret this state, but, unfortunately the army gets the final say.”
And then, as if to make sure that everybody got the point, he said, in discussing the policy of separate regiments for colored men:
“The selective service system has nothing to do with where the man goes. We are purchasing agents. What they do later is of no interest to us ... Even though the act provides against discrimination, the army has the right, to introduce the question of acceptability.”
* * *

A Scabby Role
We have had occasion in the past to criticize the action of Edgar Brown, head of the United Government Employees, in approving Roosevelt’s Jim Crow policies in the armed forces, and to point out how he in this way played into the hands of the Negro people.
Now comes new testimony to corroborate our charges against him.
For last week, Judge William Hastie, civilian aide to Secretary of War Stimson, issued a statement which by implication at least tries to divert part of the blame from Roosevelt. Said he:
“divided opinion among colored citizens on the problem of segregation in the army makes for great difficulty in solving the problem. As long as people who are opposed to mixed units are able to point to colored persons as also agreeing with this position, our problem is extremely difficult ...”
Usually, when the great majority of the workers in a factory have organized a union and presented demands to the bosses for a contract and better conditions, one or two scabs appeal’ "who say that the boss is a great guy and doing what he can to help the workers, and so on, and the bosses always point to these scabs as justification of their attempts to smash the union. Brown is playing the same role as a scab in the fight against Jim Crowism.

It’s Always There
In Philadelphia last week “the city’s business, professional and military leaders” threw a luncheon at the exclusive Manufacturers’ and Bankers’ Club in honor of the first 150 young men they were sending off to the draft from that city. Among these were 16 colored men.
Then, the story goes, “twenty gifts were presented each of them by mid-city merchants and pretty girls pinned carnations on their lapels.”
Then Judge Vincent A. Carroll, a colonel in the Cavalry Reserves, had a speech to make about the Negroes and “national defense.”
“You are showing the world,” said he, “that the Negro people of this nation have at heart the maintenance of democratic freedom, as they have since Crispus Attucks, one of their race, lost his life on Boston Common with the other patriot martyrs of the Revolution.”
But the photograph of the affair printed in the newspapers shows – yes, you guessed it – the 16 Negroes segregated off at a separate table!
* * *

Cavalrymen Won’t Be Jim Crowed
An interesting story was printed in the Afro-American last week, telling of the determination of several members of the Tenth Cavalry situated at Fort Dix, N.J., not to be Jim Crowed.
Motion pictures were being shown at the post ’ theatre, and those in charge of it attempted to segregate Negro soldiers into one part of the building. They refused to be party to such an act, and left the theatre, demanding their money back.
But the most interesting part of the story tells the complaint of one of the men to the Afro reporter:
“The colored soldier is not promoted because of his character, intelligence and ability, he said, he is promoted because of his docile attitude, his inability to think for himself, and his willingness to accept orders from his superiors in a ‘hat-in-hand manner.’ The order to segregate the soldiers at the post theatre would be rescinded if our (colored) officers demand it, he said.”
This emphasizes again the need for a system of military training under control of the trade unions, which would end discrimination and segregation, and would establish special officers’ training camps to train workers to become officers, so that the worker-soldiers would have officers on whom they could depend to fight for their rights.
Next week we shall discuss the widely publicized Conference on the Participation of the Negro in National Defense, held at Hampton Institute, Va., and see what if anything it contributed to the fight for equality in the armed forces./p>

 




The Courier Conference
The Pittsburgh Courier recognized, before the Hampton Institute conference was over, that nothing was going to come out of it that would be worth two beans in the struggle against Jim Crow in the army.
Evidently, then, at the last minute, the Courier, trying to salvage something out of the mess and to utilize the wide publicity the Hampton meeting got, decided to hold its own conference on the same subject, and there presumably take the steps rejected by Hampton. That was why this second conference, “called and sponsored” by the Courier, was called to order in Washington three days after the Hampton conference.
The overwhelming majority at Hampton seemed to be government job-holders and teachers or professors – what George Schuyler described as “soft-handed, well-groomed, cultured, income-tax-paying pillars-of-society.” This was a very fitting description – but it fits the composition of the Courier conference just as well.
The Who’s Who in the Courier lists 41 names, and gives information about 31. Of these 31, 19 are either government job-holders, or teachers or professors. All “soft-handed,” that is, not a worker in the crowd. In addition, most of them had also been at the Hampton conference.
Nor is the resolution of the second conference much better than that of the first. True, its language is sharper, more vigorous, more direct. Its position is less ambiguous, although it too does not name names or place the responsibility for the present state of things where it belongs. It also fails to take up the question of Roosevelt’s “separate regiment” policy by name, only hinting at it.
It certainly is not a revolutionary solution. And yet there is signed to it the name of George Schuyler who, in criticizing the Hampton Conference, said that only a revolutionary approach can solve the Negro’s problems. Instead of being revolutionary, as a matter of fact, it contains a section just as harmful to the Negro as anything pulled off at Hampton.
 

Not a Pro-Labor Resolution
That is the section dealing with labor, which calls on the government to investigate labor unions which by constitutional or ritualistic provisions bar Negroes from getting jobs. The Courier makes still clearer what is meant when it says, “we call upon the Attorney-General of the United States to prosecute these racketeering unions under the provisions of that (Sherman Anti-Trust) law.”
That is, the conference called on the government to end Jim Crowism in the unions, the very same government that shows its approval of Jim Crowism as a principle by its handling of the Negro in the armed forces!
Let us see what the Courier’s proposal would accomplish:

It will give the government (which dislikes both the unions and the Negroes) a handle to enter and break up the unions. Will this be in the interests of the Negro people – or in the interests of the ruling capitalist class (“the very people who keep race prejudice alive”, as Schuyler put it)?
 
It will give reactionary, lily white trade union leaders a handle to incite white workers against the Negroes, for they will be able to say, “Do you see now why we want to keep Negroes out of our unions? Because they are our enemies and are calling on the government to prosecute us and break us up.” Will this be in the interests of the Negro people – or in the interests of the reactionaries who want to keep Negroes out of the trade unions?

The one point that distinguished the Courier resolution at Hampton was the following:
“That Negroes in each community immediately proceed to the organization of a Defense Committee, composed of representatives of local organizations ... to cooperate with the central Committee in Washington, D.C., and with the local authorities.” Said the Courier: “Once these organizations have united it is proposed that they, hold huge defense mass meetings ... Representatives from these united organizations would be selected to attend” another conference planned for Washington in January shortly after the next Congress opens.”
This means that the Courier recognizes that action is necessary against the Jim Crow system in the army, and that action by the local organizations, that is, by the masses, is necessary. Insofar as the resolution draws attention to these things, it serves the interests of the Negro people.
But just because real action is necessary, the section of the resolution on the trade unions must be condemned, because it weakened if it didn’t destroy, the possibility of including the trade unions in the united front.
The main objection to be made against both the Courier and Hampton conferences, is that, while both ask for the correction of certain Jim Crow evils, they propose to leave the control of military training in the hands of the lily-white officer caste.
It is already a law that there shall be no discrimination in the armed forces – but since control of military training is in the hands of a military and governmental caste that wants to perpetuate Jim Crowism, discrimination goes on.
The National Defense Commission has already laid down the ruling that there must be no discrimination because of race or color in the factories getting war contracts, but because the bosses, who profit from racial division, control both the factories and the Defense Commission, discrimination goes on.
What is needed therefore is a system of trade union control of military training, to put control of it in the hands of the workers who have nothing to gain from discrimination. What is needed in addition is expropriation Of the war industries and their operation under workers’ control to put an end to discrimination in industry./p>

 



The ruling class of this country is preparing to seize Martinique, the French-“owned” colony with a population of a quarter-million colored people.
The fate of Martinique should be of vital interest to every Negro and white worker, for the question of Negro freedom in the United States is very much connected with what happens to the Negro people everywhere – in Africa, the West Indies, etc.
That was why the Negroes here and everywhere were and are so concerned about the independence of Ethiopia. We knew that the successful defeat of the Fascist invasion of Ethiopia would have been a blow at the bosses, the oppressors of the Negroes of all countries; that’s why we of the Socialist Workers Party supported Ethiopia’s fight for independence.
From this point of view, let us examine the editorials on Martinique which have been recently carried by two of the leading Negro newspapers of this country.
The Baltimore Afro-American editorial is entitled, Let’s Take Martinique. When the writer says let us, he means let the United States government take it. The arguments of the editorial are almost the same ones made by the American capitalists, who have had experience “taking” other colonial countries in the past:
“As long as France is tied to Hitler’s apron-strings, it seems to us that the United States ought to step in and take over the island for the duration of the war.
“France couldn’t object. It lies prostrate under Hitler’s heel. After the war is over, it can have its island back.
“There is another reason why we should take Martinique. Its 250,000 people are poor and hungry. The British blockade has ruined the trade. “Uncle Sam can do them a favor and get rid of a likely headache if he adopts these few French-speaking colored folks until peace comes.”
In other words, says the Afro-American, Washington should take the island because it would be the best thing for its natives.
They are poor and hungry, says the Afro-American. But so are the people of the other countries Washington has “taken.” Just look at Porto Rico! Its people were starved by Spain. Now they’ve been “taken” by the United States for more than 40 years and – the Afro-American would scarcely deny it – the people of Porto Rico have been poor and hungry throughout these years, and remain so.
And so far as “adopting” the island “until peace comes” is concerned, that is a childish joke. If that happened, it would be the first time in its history that Washington or London or Paris took over a small country and then willingly let it go. The bosses of this country don’t take over colonies out of good nature or concern for their people’s welfare – they take them to be able to exploit them, and Martinique is a rich prize which they will no more give up after the war than they gave up the Philippines 40 years ago.
 
The Courier Takes a Different Stand
The Pittsburg Courier editorial takes a different position. After making clear that it has no sympathy for Petain or the Nazis, the editorial says: “We certainly view with alarm the projected grabbing of Martinique by the United States presumably to forestall Hitler ...” It then explains that Martinique happens to be one of these few colonies where the natives do have some rights:
“There are 246,712 inhabitants of Martinique and all but a handful are Negroes or mulattoes. They vote, they have direct representation in the French parliament, they serve without discrimination or restriction in the French Army and Navy where many have risen to high rank. They have freely attended France’s best universities and have good local schools.
“Not a single British colony or American dependency is as free as black Martinique, and we shudder when we contemplate what Negrophobic U.S. naval rule will mean to this little Eden.
“Under American rule, Martinique would have no representation in Congress, its sons and daughters would be barred from a large number of mainland universities, and its sons would be viciously discriminated against in the armed forces and defense industries.”
“So,”, concludes the Pittsburgh Courier, “for the sake of Martinique’s dark sons and daughters, we hope it will remain under French rule.”
Let’s pass over, without the refutation it deserves, the Courier’s picture of “little Eden.” It’s true that France commits less formal discrimination against Negroes as Negroes; France mistreats all her colonials regardless of color!
Let’s get to the main point. The Afro-American wants Martinique ruled by America; the Courier wants it ruled by France. The two opinions may seem different; at bottom, however, they are very much alike. They share in common the theory of “the lesser evil:” since you’ve got to be a slave, you might as well pick yourself the “best” and “kindest” master. Both take it for granted that Martinique must “belong” to someone, i.e., someone other than the people of Martinique.
This attitude is not new to either paper. They both employed it quite consistently in the election campaign just concluded. Both had endorsed Roosevelt in 1936, and repudiated the Republican Party. Both became disgusted with Roosevelt this year, and endorsed Willkie. And thus they limit the struggle to being Jim Crowed under one boss party or Jim Crowed under another.
The capitalists and their press say that the colored people in the colonies are not fit to rule themselves; that is why the imperialists must run things for them. This is the same vicious lie that they use in this country to perpetuate segregation and discrimination against the Negro people.
What have the Courier and the Afro to say about this? Why do they reject this theory for the Negroes in the United States and accept it for the Negroes in the colonies? How can they accept “white supremacy” for the colonies and logically answer the advocates of “white supremacy” in this country? Why did they demand the independence of Ethiopia and why don’t they demand the independence of Martinique? How can they logically demand it for one, and not for the other?
It seems to us that these papers which claim leadership in the fight for equal rights for the Negro people “in all spheres of life” have some explaining to do to their readers.
As for us of the Socialist Workers Party, we take a view entirely different from those of the Courier and the Afro-American on this question.

We are against the “white supremacy” theory everywhere, in this country and in the colonies.
 
We are against the “lesser evil” theory, we are against all kinds of slavery and discrimination, in this country and in the colonies.
 
We don’t want France to get back “its island,” as the Afro-American calls it, because they would keep the people in slavery and oppression.
 
We don’t want the Nazis to get it, because they would keep its people in slavery and oppression.
 
We don’t want the United States to “take” it, because they would keep its people in slavery and oppression.
 
Martinique should belong to the people of Martinique.

But, the “practical” editors of the Courier and the Afro-American may say with a patronizing smile, “how can the people of this small island possible keep from being taken over by one or other of the imperialist countries?”
To these “practical” people, we answer: The people of Martinique may not be able to free themselves at this moment. But that’s no reason for you “spokesmen of the Negro” to endorse one or another slavemaster for Martinique!
The first step on the road to freedom for Martinique – and for the colored people everywhere – is first of all not to praise any slavemaster but to declare oneself against all slavemasters. Do that – and you will find powerful allies: the revolutionary white workers. Tomorrow, hand in hand with these allies, you will find your way to the leadership of all the oppressed everywhere. “We are many, they are few.” On this road – and only on this road – shall we all, black and white, find freedom.
 



Rear Admiral Nimitz, chief of the Bureau of Navigation, Navy Department, last week finally told what had happened to the fifteen Negro sailors on the U.S.S. Philadelphia who had written a letter protesting Jim Crow conditions in the Navy.
Nimitz announced, in an interview with P.L. Prattis, Executive Editor of the Pittsburgh Courier, that 13 of the sailors had been kicked out of the Navy with “undesirable” discharges, and that the other two were still in the brig, probably being held for even more drastic action.
The commanding officer of the Philadelphia, after the, boys’ letter had been printed in the Courier on Oct. 5, had placed them all under arrest. He had then forced them all to write statements, telling why they had signed the letter and who had suggested it.
This was obviously a move to find out who was the “brains” behind the letter.
When he had these letters, the commanding officer filed charges against the boys and recommended to the Navy Department that they be court-martialed.
He charged them with violating sub-paragraph 7 of Article 8 of Chapter 1 of the Articles of War, which reads:
“Or joins in or abets any combination to weaken the lawful authority of or to lessen the respect due to his commanding officer.”
In addition to this charge was another “conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline.”
 
Dangerous Precedent
In other words, if a Negro sailor signs a letter saying he is being Jim Crowed and doesn’t like it, he is “joining a combination to weaken the lawful authority of his commanding officer”!
If he writes to the people outside of the Navy and asks to help put an end to the policy that permits Negroes to become only mess attendants and cooks, then he is guilty of “lessening the respect due his commanding officer”!
That, at least, is the viewpoint of the officer caste that runs the ships and every day violates the law passed by Congress that prohibits discrimination in the armed forces against any person because of race or color.
The commanding officer wanted them court-martialed. But the Bureau of Navigation takes a lighter view of the matter. It agrees that this action is almost as bad as a mutiny, but doesn’t feel it wise to have the mess boys hanged from the yard-arm.
So the Bureau over-ruled the recommendation of the highly respected officer and gave orders for thirteen of the boys to be transferred to the receiving station nearest their homes and there given “undesirable” discharges. (A discharge of this nature differs from a dishonorable discharge in that it does not deprive the man of his civil rights. It is a discharge, as the Navy officers call it, “for the good of the service.”)
The other two men are still in jail, which would indicate that the commanding officer decided that they had “instigated” the letter, and that Admiral Nimitz has accepted the recommendation of the commanding officer that they be court-martialed.
But the case would not be closed even if all the men had been set free. Indeed, the fight must go on as long as the officer caste controls military training and has the power to Jim Crow Negroes.
This was indicated also by the Courier in its issue of December 7 in the story entitled Here Are Six More ‘Chambermaids’ You Can Fire, Rear Admiral Nitmitz, which contained another letter, from a group of six Negro sailors of the U.S.S. Davis, stationed at San Diego. California.
This letter, which is the sixth signed by groups of mess attendants on as many different ships in the Navy in the last two months, tells the same story that the others did, of segregation,, brutal discrimination and vicious punishment for any “back-talk.”
Unfortunately, like the others, the authors of this letter, while they demonstrate great courage in signing their names, make the mistake of urging as a solution “that the Negro youth of America ... cease to enlist in the U.S. Navy.”
As we have indicated in our pamphlet, Defend The Negro Sailors of the U.S.S. Philadelphia, such a policy will not solve the problem because it is ineffective in the face of conscription: because it will not help the 4,000 Negro sailors, already in the Navy; and because it does not take into consideration the need for military training of all kinds by the oppressed Negro people and the working class, if they are to be able to defeat their enemies.
The latest developments in the Philadelphia case point once again to the need for the Negro people to join in the struggle for a system of military training under the control of the trade unions – take control and power out of the hands of the Jim Crow and anti-labor officers and put it in the hands of the workers themselves.
 



PASSAIC, N.J., Dec. 15 – The Lewis wing of the CIO suffered a setback here this week-end as the Hillman forces in the New Jersey CIO convention succeeded in winning a victory which gave it control of the state executive board for the coming year.
The margin of votes between the Hillman-Abramson-textile forces and the Lewis-Stalinist bloc was not very great, however, and the tide could easily have been turned the other way had it not been for the bungling and timidity of the state leaders of the Lewis bloc.
As a result of this poor leadership, therefore, a strong weapon is now in the hands of the group in this state’s CIO which is ready,
when Hillman gives the word, to capitulate to the government and the craft unionists on the crucial issue of industrial unionism.
At the start of the convention Knapik, one of the Hillman leaders, made this clear when he stated that the CIO should immediately reopen “unity” negotiations with the AFL. The lack of applause was a warning to him, and he hastily added that negotiations must not lead to destroying a single one of the CIO international unions.
The Hillman leaders apparently decided that it would be unwise in a closely-contested convention to bring into the open their real position on industrial unionism, so they put it away in the background. The Lewis-Stalinist wing permitted them to do so.
 
Whitewashing Hillman
The first fight broke out on an attempt to whitewash the role Hillman is playing in the National Defense Council. If was dramatically announced that Hillman had entered a protest that day against the granting of a government contract to Henry Ford, and the Hlllmanites introduced a resolution to commend Hillman for this action.
A few delegates managed to get the floor in spite, of the bureaucratic chairmanship of Hillmanite Abramson, and to point out that this was a whitewash resolution designed to cover up Hillman’s treacheries. What about his handling of Bethlehem Steel? they asked. What about his handling of strikes? An amendment was made that the CIO oppose the granting of contracts to all violators of the labor laws. Discussion was cut off, and in the voice vote, it seemed, the amendment was carried. Abramson, however, refused a roll call vote and declared the original motion carried. After this, the
Hillmanites were very careful to see that no important issue at all reached the floor, and their opponents unfortunately played into their hands on this.
At a caucus of the anti-Hillman delegates held after adjournment the first day, it was agreed that the major issues of the convention were industrial unionism, opposition to curbing of labor activity, formation of an independent labor party, and control of the state board to advance the fight on these questions. “We will carry the fight to them on, every issue,” said a Stalinist spokesman, “and force a vote to see where things stand.”
However, this was not done. The Lewis-Stalinist leaders the next morning made an agreement with the Hillman leaders for a “test vote” on the constitutional provisions for electing the state board, and thus made this the major question of the convention.
The Hillmanites proposed that they be permitted to continue the practice of having representation on the state board from various sections of the Amalgamated and the textile union, although other unions are not permitted more than one or two representatives from any international. This would mean control of the board by the Hillmanites.
The Stalinists countered this by demanding only one representative from each international. And then, instead of exposing Hillman’s real, aims of, capitulation to the AFL, instead of a programmatic assault which would have won support, the Stalinists confined themselves to such arguments as: “It isn’t fair, it isn’t democratic, the electrical workers could do the same and ask for representation for their different parts of their industry,” etc. In this way, they obscured the main issues and conducted the fight on the plane where the Hillmanites wanted it.
Delegates who wanted to hammer home the principles agreed upon at the caucus the day before were denied the floor as the result of an agreement between the heads of the two blocs which cut discussion short after a few of the leaders had spoken.
The result of the test vote was 305 to 293. Thus the Hillmanites won a close victory where they might well have been routed. Responsible for this was:

Lewis from the national office had sent down word urging that both sides avoid controversial “national issues,” thus taking away from his group in the convention their strongest weapon.
 
The cowardice and stupidity of the state Lewis-Stalinist leaders who permitted the fight to be fought out on a machine, non-programmatic basis.
 
The fact that the Hillmanites spent several thousand dollars prior to the convention getting their locals into good standing, while the Lewis leaders fumbled the job, getting for example a representation of 20 steel delegates when they might easily have had 60.

Instead of carrying the fight further during the rest of the convention, the Stalinists practically gave up the fight after this first vote. Almost everything else was referred to the incoming state board, which was elected with a majority of Hillmanites.
One interesting exception was the resolution that was adopted condemning fascism, nazism and communism. To this, for the first time, in a CIO convention the Stalinists took exception, demanded the floor, opposed it vigorously and rose against it on a standing vote. The Hillmanites jeeringly replied that what was good enough for the national CIO was good enough for them, referring to the fact that the Stalinists at the national convention had all voted for the same resolution.
 




The Hampton Institute Conference
Roosevelt blessed the Hampton Institute Conference on the Participation of the Negro in National Defense, because he knew who was conducting it and knew that they were not interested in embarrassing his schemes for the war and its preparations.
In spite of that, such is the logic of the position of the Negro in American life that the resolution on military and naval policy adopted by this group of Negro petty bourgeoisie, teachers, doctors, lawyers and so on who on the whole support the war, is a slap in the face to Roosevelt!
The resolution asks that Negroes be permitted to serve in all branches of the armed forces without restriction; that the exclusion policies barring Negroes from the marine corps and the army nurse corps be abolished; that the War Department be asked to put into effect the law passed some time ago by Congress, providing for training of Negro aviation pilots; that additional Negro officers be trained; that Roosevelt and local congressmen be asked to appoint Negroes to the naval academy at Annapolis, and that they be given equal opportunity if they get there (there are none there now); that Negroes be employed in all branches of the selective service system; that Negro soldiers and officers in the army be in proportion to the Negroes in the total population, etc.
The resolution is weak. It fails to demand an end to the “separate regiment” policy of the Army. It fails to ask that colored officers be permitted to serve in all regiments, and seems satisfied if “colored officers and professionals be assigned to the four colored regular army regiments.” Above all, it fails to indicate how equal rights are to be won by the Negro masses, it doesn’t say what is to be done when Roosevelt and Congress and the War Department are asked for these things and won’t give them.
It will not surprise our readers to learn that the conference did not even consider the position supported by the Socialist Workers Party: that the only why to end Jim Crowism in the armed forces is through a well-organized struggle for trade union control of military training. After all, there wasn’t a single trade unionist present, or even a worker, so far as one could learn from the conference publicity.
 

Schuyler’s Writing and His Action
Before the Hampton Institute Conference was held, many of the Uncle Tom “leaders” were talking things up, pointing to it as the way out, as the instrument of struggle against Jim Crowism in the armed forces. The only person who gave a correct indication of what was going to happen was George S. Schuyler, in his column in the Pittsburgh Courier of November 30, sent to press before the conference was over. What he said deserves to be quoted and remembered:
“It is very rarely that anything new or unusual is uttered in any of these addresses, or anything really helpful added to the cause or causes for which the conference is ostensibly held. After the ordeal of speech-making comes the round table discussions, where various egos battle for utterance. Out of all this tonsil and eartorturing usually comes a set of resolutions so general and so platitudinous as to make tragically wasteful the spending of so much carfare, unless the real purpose is to enrich the railroads and gasoline companies.
“Of the 200 ‘authorities’ assembled at Hampton, it is probable that few had anything worthwhile to offer ‘to solve the question of the Negro’s place in the current National Defense scheme’ or anything else. I have sat through several such conferences and always left with a feeling of dejection.
“To solve the problems of the Negro in America calls for a social revolution, and social revolutions must be preceded by revolutionary thinking and be led by revolutionary leaders. Solving the Negroes’ problems (if, forsooth, they CAN be solved) is going to be a long, hard and messy job. And the kind of soft-handed, well-groomed, cultured, income-tax-paying, pillars-of-society who foregather at these conferences, after a night in a Pullman drawing room or a dash by airplane, shudder at the thought of anything revolutionary. They are mostly house-broken by government berths or sinecures, institutions owned or controlled by the very people who keep race prejudice alive ...
“There has been very little consistent, persistent and intelligent action (to solve the Negro’s problems) because, to tel) the simple truth, we have had no real democratically organized, nationwide and ably led organization controlled from below and responsive to the needs and demands of the masses of colored people everywhere
“If there were such an organization it could go into action on any and all problems faced by Negroes in our American barbarism. And because it financed and backed its elected delegates and agents, they would be free, yes, compelled to represent only the Negro masses, and not be concerned about what anybody else thought.
“If we had had such an organization, it would have been working on the army and navy discrimination problem through the years, educating the masses of Negroes by consistent and persistent propaganda and action. It would have worked out some technique of fighting other than sending letters and telegrams of protest ... By this time if would have been so powerful that a national conference would have aroused far more than the indulgent smirk which doubtless greeted the Hampton talkfest ...”
And yet, two days after this excellent article had appeared op the news-stands, Schuyler was down in Washington participating in. another conference on “national defense”, attended, for the most part, by people who had attended the Hampton conference!
(Next week: The Courier Conference)/p>

 




The Hampton Institute Conference
To understand what happened at the much publicized Conference on the Participation of the Negro in National Defense, held last week at Hampton Institute, Va., it is necessary to understand the reason the conference was held and the things it set out to do.
As a full page advertisement of the Institute put it, “Defense Conference Marks New Era. Symbolic of a new era ahead for Hampton was the two-day conference ... Nationally known authorities, both Negro and white, concentrated their thoughts on specific programs of both immediate and long time value on how the Negro may best serve the country in the interests of total defense and national unity. Their discussions covered comprehensive subjects – Military and Naval Defense, Industry, Family Life, Labor. The Consumer, Youth, Education, Business, The Press, Morale and Mental Hygiene, Agriculture, Public Health, Housing, Recreation and Religion ...”
It should be clear from the above statement that these “nationally known authorities” were interested in “serving the country” – i.e., the bosses of this country – not in serving the interests. of the Negro people who get such a raw deal in this country.
That the government itself did not see in this body any serious threat to its publicly announced and carefully worked out policies of Jim Crowism in the armed forces was made clear in the statement of Roosevelt himself, the author and executor of these policies:
“It is heartening to know that in this time of stress and strain, when the whole nation is engaged in a mighty effort to gird itself against any challenge which a mad world may hurl at it, you ... are to hold a two-day conference on the participation of the Negro in national defense ... There could be no finer manifestation of the loyalty of the Negro, no more fitting rededication of himself to the cause of America, than the conference which you are holding.”
This is Roosevelt’s nice and flowery way of saying: Go ahead, hold your conference, it will be heartening to me because by and large what you will do will help to get the Negroes to support my war program.
 

Whitewashing the Bosses
The highlight of a speech by Aubrey Williams was an attempt to set the Negro against the trade union movement:
“Look at the Negro in the labor field. Negro youth is faced with the same difficulties that white youth faces, but added to these are the prejudiced barriers set up by many employees and the discriminatory practices set up by the labor and trade unions. What is the result? Only 2% get skilled jobs as against 8% for white youth –  less than 10% get semi-skilled jobs against 20% for white youth. And when they do get full-time jobs, the Negro youth averages 49 hours a week for a wage of $8.75, while the white youth averages 44 hours for a wage of $15.71.”
Williams thus places the full blame for industrial discrimination against Negroes on the union movement as such, without bothering to indicate that this is not true of the CIO movement, and not true about many AFL unions. In this way, he whitewashes the forces chiefly responsible for discrimination in industry: the bosses who own and control the factories that Jim Crow or exclude colored workers. And he whitewashes the government which, if it wanted to, could easily have passed a law denying war contracts to those factories that discriminate against Negroes.
Yes, some trade union leaders are guilty of Jim Crowism, and we of the Socialist Workers Party have pointed out again and again that this can be corrected only by persistent and organized action of the progressive white and Negro members of the union movement.
Williams has a lot of nerve talking about someone else when he himself enforces a policy of segregation in the NYA, of which he is administrator, a policy which sets up “white projects” and “Negro projects” and does not permit mixing of the two races on any NYA project, even in the North where many of the white and Negro youth whom he separates used to attend school together.
 

“The Nationally Known Authorities”
As for the round-table sessions of the “authorities,” they were not much better.
As an example, consider the “authorities” scheduled to sit and solve the problems of the Negro on “Industry and Labor”:
One administrative assistant of the National Defense Advisory Commission; one superintendent of the Ford Industrial School; one director of the Department of Social Sciences, Fisk University; one representative of Hampton Institute; three officials of the Urban League; one race relations officer, Personnel Division, Federal Works Agency; and one representative of the Bureau of Employment Security.
That means: zero representatives of the trade union movement, and zero working men or women, present.
Yet, whatever else it might do or avoid doing, however much it might desire to curry favor with Roosevelt, there was one thing this conference could not avoid doing, and which served to expose Roosevelt: it had to adopt a resolution opposing Roosevelt’s anti-Negro policy in the armed forces and to ask for an end to certain phases of policy. It wasn’t a very strong resolution; on the contrary, it was weak, inadequate and vague – but it shows up Roosevelt because he will not end Jim Crow in the armed forces.

Roosevelt “Promotes” Davis
Two weeks ago in this column we drew attention to the failure of President Roosevelt to promote Col. Benjamin O. Davis, Negro officer, to the rank of brigadier-general, as he did with scores of white colonels at the same time.
In it we declared what everyone acquainted with the situation knew: that the Army is a Jim Crow institution, that it does everything it can to prevent Negroes from becoming officers, and that it sees to it that they don’t rise higher than the post of colonel.
Now, however, Roosevelt has promoted Davis to be a brigadier-general, the first such colored officer in the Army’s history.
Does this mean that there has been any change in the Army’s Jim Crow policies? Does this mean that now there will be equal rights for colored soldiers, that discrimination against them will end, that they will receive a proportionate number of officers’ posts?
Look at the facts, and you’ll have to answer: No.
In the first place, whatever happened to Davis, the recent ruling of Commander-in-Chief Roosevelt that there shall be Jim Crow regiments still remains in effect. That means that Negro soldiers will not get equal rights, that they will still be used for laborers or suicide squads, suffering all the insults of the Negro-hating officer caste that runs the Army and will continue to run the Army even if Davis is a brigadier-general.
Every anti-Semitic firm, every big business outfit that refuses to hire Jews, usually has one Jew on its office staff, to be pointed to as an example of their unprejudiced hiring policies. This one Jewish employee is used as window-dressing to cover up the rotten general policy.
Davis is going to be used as the window-dressing of the U.S. Army, for a time, to cover up the vicious anti-Negro policies of its general staff.
But even more important than this reason is the fact that election day is almost here.
 

A Vote-Catching Move
In the last month Roosevelt has lost considerable votes as the result of his statement on Jim Crow regiments. He has taken a heavy walloping from most of the Negro press on it, and from the N.A.A.C.P. for his attempt to make it seem they had approved this policy.
In many states the colored vote may prove decisive. Consequently, Roosevelt has attempted, by promoting Davis, to repair some of the fences he broke himself.
As proof, we point to the date of the announcement of his promotion: October 25th. This is just in time for the last issue of the Negro weekly papers that will appear on the news-stands before November 5. It thus gives him the final punch in the campaign, in even the papers that oppose him and support Willkie.
The general staff of the Army won’t like it, even though they recognize it as a necessary political maneuver that won’t change anything fundamentally. But they won’t worry too much. For Davis is 63 years old, and will reach his retirement age July 1. So Roosevelt will get his votes when Davis gets his promotion, and a few months later when Davis gets his walking papers, the general staff will get the pleasure of being 100% lily-white again.
Although the appointment of Davis is partially a concession to mass protest, it is primarily a vote-catcher. It is no reason for relaxing the fight, Jim Crowism must still be fought by workers, colored and white, in the armed forces, as well as in civilian life.
 

Judas-Goat Dunjee
A “Judas goat” is one of those old, hardened, well-trained animals used in the stockyards to lead the sheep up the incline. When the goat gets to the top, he steps aside, but the sheep keep right on marching until they run into the butchers’ knives. Then the goat comes down again, and is used over and over again to lead more unsuspecting sheep to their end.
Roscoe Dunjee, about whom we had a few things to say last week, is the editor of The Black Dispatch in Oklahoma. Last week he wrote an article asking that all Negro newspapermen be exempted from conscription. Why? Because they had been very valuable, he said, in getting the Negro people to accept the draft. And if these very valuable newspapermen are drafted, he feels, the newspapers will be weakened, and may not be able to do such a good job in the future.
Roscoe Dunjee is a Judas goat who has led his followers up the incline of the Jim Crow draft. But he doesn’t want the same fate as the sheep. He wants to be excused so that he will be safely on band to lead mors sheep to the butchers’ knives.
 

Forty Dollars a Head
When a colored man is even suspected of killing a white person down South, all resources of the state are used to capture him. Rewards of thousands of dollars are offered, blood-hounds and posses called out, and the victim is given short shrift when he is caught.
But it is different when the victim is a colored man.
In Washington, D.C., capital of the nation and frontier of Jim Crow land, seven Negroes have been fired on by a mysterious white maniac during the past few months. Five were killed and two injured.
Little effort has been made by the police to capture the maniac, who picks only colored victims. A total reward of $200 has been posted for his capture. That comes to $40 a head, or, one-twentieth of what a slave was worth 80 years ago./p>

 




A Letter About the U.G.E. Article
“I read with a considerable amount, of interest your remarks on the stand taken by the United Government Employees at their recent convention in Washington. I also read in the same issue the resolution of the Political Committee of the Socialist Workers Party in which they give their position on the relation of the Negro to the armed forces.
“I find myself in agreement with most of what was said in both articles, but there is at least one thing which I am not sure I understand.
“In your party's resolution, under Point 5, is the following paragraph discussing the question of mixed or separate regiments:
“‘Because many Negroes have had personal experience of discrimination and segregation inflicted on them by backward workers in factories and in trade unions, a sentiment may arise in the course of the struggle for union control of military training for the right of Negro soldiers to choose for themselves whether they shall be in mixed regiments or in all-Negro regiments. In such a case we must pledge ourselves to support the right of the Negro soldiers to determine the question for themselves ...
“However, on the very next page, in your article on the United Government Employees, there occurs a case where a group of Negroes themselves have met and decided that they prefer separate regiments as long as they get colored officers— and you attack them very strongly for this. I do not dispute your attacking them, as I believe you were well justified in this. They were not considering the interests of the Negro people, they were carrying on a political fight to elect. Roosevelt and to cover up that be had announced a policy in the army that was aimed at Negroes. I also accept the other reasons you gave for attacking them.
“But what I do not understand is how this jibes with your party’s resolution which as I understand it says that Negroes themselves should have the right to determine this question.
“It seems to me that you owe your readers a bit of explanation on this contradiction. I feel that you should have discussed this, at least, in your article.”
 

Answer to the Letter
We do not find any inconsistency in the article on the U.G.E.’s endorsement on Roosevelt’s Jim Crow military policy and in the resolution our party has adopted on military policy.
We condemned the Edgar Brown-U.G.E. policy for the following reasons:

It was dictated by the political needs of the Roosevelt administration, not by the demands of the Negro people for equal rights in all phases of American life. Some Negro group was needed to win back the votes that were endangered or lost when Roosevelt himself said that the Jim Crow policies in the armed forces had proved “satisfactory over a long period of years.” As such, the U.G.E. resolution is an endorsement of the theory that the Negro is different and inferior, because that is the principle underlying segregation in the army. That means an endorsement and acceptance of Jim Crow policies everywhere!
 
The separate regiment policy cannot protect Negroes, even if they have Negro officers. What they have to be protected from is special choice for the menial, flunkey jobs and the assignments to duty in situations where mens’ lives are thrown away like matchsticks. Because the Negro soldiers will be off by themselves, the Jim Crow general staff, as long as it controls things, will always be able to pick them out for “special assignment,” as they did so often in the last war.

Now what, on the other hand, does the fight for the right of the Negroes to decide the question imply?
First of all, it implies a fight against the government policy. The ruling class says, “Negroes must go into separate regiments, whether they like it or not, because we think it’s most satisfactory.” That is, since under the present policy Negroes don’t have any say in the matter, the first thing they must do is fight against the official policy that denies them any voice in the matter and segregates them at the same time.
Secondly, it means a fight for control of military training. Whoever controls military training is in a position to decide what happens to the soldiers, colored as well as white. A struggle for the right of the Negroes to determine whether they shall be in mixed or separate regiments means a struggle to take control from the officer caste that runs things today and to put it into the hands of the soldiers themselves.
How different this is, then, from the hat-in-hand, body-braced-for-a-kick attitude of Brown and his cohorts.
“In short,” said the resolution of the Socialist Workers Party, “we differentiate between segregation under bosses’ control and self-determination under workers’ control. We are against the first, we are for the right of the second. It is part of our program, but is not a field for extensive agitation at this time.”
But our letter writer is correct in saying that in our article on Brown we should have contrasted his attitude with our own position on the question of “self-determination" on the question of mixed or separate regiments.
 

Correction
In our column last week on the effect of the poll tax in eight southern states, we said “only about 10% (of the adult population) can enter the voting booths.” This is not correct. More near the figure for the presidential election of 1936 would be about 20%, although in some places it is 10%. This does not change the point of the article, for the figure of 60% quoted for the rest of the country is still correct./p>

 



Because they bravely exposed the hypocritical nature of the slogans about a “war for democracy,” and because they warned other Negroes about the falsity of the promises of the recruiting sergeants about “joining the Navy seeing the world and learning a trade,” two of the fifteen Negro mess boys on the U.S.S. Philadelphia stationed at Long Beach, California, are in prison awaiting court-martial, and the others are prisoners-at-large, forbidden to leave the ship, held for “further investigation.”
Letters from two of the men on the ship sent to the Pittsburgh Courier this week appeal to that paper to publicize the fact that the officer caste is attempting to terrorize them because they dared to sign their names to the previous letter.
 
Afraid to Sign
One of them, ending “I am afraid to sign my name. One of the Philadelphia Boys,” sends the information that “Goodwin and Johnson were put. in prison for standing up for their rights and all the rest of us can’t leave the ship ... I hope the people of my race will not stand up and see men tell the truth and go to prison.”
The other, also unsigned, explains that the “Commanding Officer of the ship is holding all of us for an investigation trying to force the boys to tell who is the brains of that letter.”
 
Officers Grill Men
It is plain from this that the officers of the Philadelphia are determind to put an end to any protests to public opinion against Jim Crowism. They have arrested two of the men and are grilling the others to find out who the “agitators” and “instigators” are. It is inconceivable to them that men can be driven just so far and then they revolt without the help of “agitators” because they just can’t stand the torment and insult to which they are subjected.
But it is equally plain that so far they have had no success. The toys are sticking together and, in the face of intensified inquisition, are still appealing to the public for help.
 
Aid Comes
Already they are being joined by men from other ships, coming to their aid, helping as much as they can under the circumstances.
One of these, a mess man from the far-away Naval Air Base at Opa Locha, Florida, helps to break through the wall of silence surrounding the case by passing on to the Courier a letter he had received from Byron Johnson, who has since been thrown into prison.
Johnson, in answering a question from him on the results of their letter’s publication, wrote:
“We are now P.A.L. (prisoners-at-large). Of course, we can’t do much since they have us restricted until the outcome of the case. As it is now, we are unable to do anything since we can’t make any outside contacts. So it is up to you to carry on where we left off ... The boys of the Philadelphia are depending on everyone to buck us up.”
The sailor who received this letter signed his name, saying:
“If you publish anything about this letter, you may publish my name if you feel it necessary to do so. That, of course, would probably mean that I would meet the same fate Byron Johnson and his friends met. But I am fanatical enough about it all to allow that to happen to me too, if necessary.”
The Courier did not print his name.
This is followed by a long letter signed by Richard C. Watts. Donald Moran and William Seabrook, of the U.S.S. Sampson, stationed at Norfolk. Virginia, in which, after paying tribute to the courage of the Philadelphia men they proceed to uncover a system of Jim Crow conditions on board their ship that easily rivals for viciousness the story told about the Philadelphia.
These conditions exist not only in the every day life of the ship, but on Sunday too, for as they say:
“The Constitution clearly provides that all men are created equal, yet in our Naval churches – both Protestant and Catholic – discrimination is openly practiced. When conditions are so bad that people who say they are believers of God, are choicy about who sits beside them, then it is time that we pray and start to do something about it.”
“We (colored) men in the Navy are just flunkies, disguised in a uniform ... It will be found that on the smaller ships in the Navy, the mess boys really do not have a place to eat their food properly. He either has to stand up or sit down on the deck to eat. while the rest of the crew have designated tables, where they may sit, talk, properly masticate and enjoy their food.”
 
Sent to Brig
“We are subjected to be roughly spoken to three-fourths of the time, cursed at sometimes, with out a murmur of resentment coming from us. In case of resentment we are put on report, restricted, fined, or sent to the brig for being insubordinate to a superior officer, etc. ...
“Wherever we turn we hear the words, ‘Don’t do this’ or ‘Don’t do that’, or you don’t get liberty for a week. We are not wanted to talk to each other when an officer is around, and in general, an officer is to be treated as though he were a god or king.”
 
Ships Are Jails
“Literally speaking, the Negro is in jail under observation but somebody thought it would sound nicer to call it the Navy ...
“The majority of officers seem to think that we Negroes are just a race of illiterates who have to have someone standing over them with a whip all the time and tell them what to do ...
“We are allowed thirty days leave each year, which we rarely get because the officers want us there to serve them ...”
 
Time to Wake Up
And the letter ends:
“We are not trying to stir up strife, hatred or discontentment, we are only trying to tell our people that it is time to wake up and go to the front and demand what we so justly deserve. We have slept long enough. Now is the time for more action and less talk!”
As the Courier points out:
“Col. Benjamin O. Davis has been made a general in the United States Army, but that means nothing. Judge William Hastie had been named a civilian aide to the Secretary of War, but that means nothing. Major Campbell Johnson has been made executive assistant to the director of selective service, but that means nothing. THE UNITED STATES NAVY STILL ABUSES, RESTRICTS AND JIM CROWS BLACK BOYS!”
 
End Their Control
That’s true and it will continue to abuse, restrict and: Jim Crow them as long as the Negro-hating, labor-hating generals and admirals continue to control military and naval training!
One Negro general, colored assistants and aides can do nothing as long as the military caste controls things.
Let us, in addition to defending these boys, take a page from their heroic books and carry to a finish the fight for workers’ control of military and naval training!
 




Hillman Ignores Jim Crow
It is not only on the question of awards to corporations guilty of refusing to recognize the rights of trade unions that Sidney Hillman is being attacked nowadays. It is also because he has taken no steps to do anything about the war production industries’ almost universal policy to refuse to hire colored workers at all, or to hire them only as porters, etc.
One instance after another has been widely publicized in the Negro press, giving names of scores of the largest corporations receiving contracts from the federal government, that openly announce their Jim Crow hiring policies.
Hillman has not done a thing about it to date, any more than he has done anything else generally for the working class in his post of Labor Commissioner of the National Defense Council.
His announced intention of resigning as vice-president of the CIO in order to devote himself fully to protecting the bosses’ interests in the labor field should produce no tears from workers, Negro and white, for whose interests he has shown by his actions he has no intention of fighting.
 

Harrison Appointment Protested
Vigorous protests were entered this week against the rumored appointment of George M. Harrison as next Secretary of Labor by both the National Urban League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Harrison is the grand president of the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, and his policies and record in the labor movement with regard to Negro workers were offered as more than adequate reasons why he should not be permitted to receive a post where he would have wider jurisdiction for his Jim Crow policies.
Harrison, according to the Urban League, has as head of this union concurred in its membership policies which shunt colored railway clerks off into “auxiliary locals” where they pay the same dues as the white workers but have no voice in the determination of union policy and no representation on the policy-making bodies, or conventions.
It was also pointed out that Harrison had played a prominent smelly role in the fight against colored freight-handlers (reported in the article below.) The NAACP telegram to Roosevelt said, “Negro Americans and their white fellow workers who are seeking full democracy in the labor movement view with justified alarm possibility of having as Secretary of Labor a man who believes that Negroes are not entitled to full membership in organized unions.
Both organizations also objected to the “trade union segregationist” who is already in the Department of Labor, Dan Tracy, head of the AFL Electrical Workers Union.
 

Seek Showdown at AFL Convention
Efforts were being made this week to bring to the floor of the AFL convention the story of a fight being conducted by the colored National Council of Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees, representing about 50 federal union locals and 2,000 workers throughout the country, to protect their rights as union members.
After six years of struggle to establish these federal locals, during which they received no help whatever from the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, and during which, they obtained contracts from a number of important railroads, they were ordered last September by William Green to comply with the order of Harrison, head of the BRC, to turn in their charters and their treasuries and join powerless, Jim Crow auxiliaries.
Meeting in Cincinnati at that time, delegates from these locals voted not to abide by Green’s order. They demanded either a separate international charter from the AFL or the right to join the BRC with the same rights that other members enjoyed. In the meantime they decided to continue their work under the National Council plan.
Harrison has indicated that “we will not surrender jurisdiction over these workers” in his letter to Arthur Williams, head of the Council. Green is backing him, of course, in spite of the fact that the AFL’s official position, as written down on paper at several conventions, condemns all forms of discrimination on account of race or color.
 

Jim Crow Women Too
It’s not only men who get Jim-Crowed by the Army. Women are eligible for this treatment too. An example will show that women can be hurt pretty hard by this kind of treatment too.
Mrs. Burmeda Coleman and Miss Hattie Combre, employed by the Louisiana Industrial Insurance Company in New Orleans, took a civil service examination for tabulating machine operators at Camp Beauregard, near Alexandria, La.
On November 7 they received telegrams from the Camp to report for work. They then quit their jobs, which were relatively quite good ones, and spent a bit of money travelling from New Orleans to Alexandria.
When they got there on November 11, however, they were met by Major Dupont, commanding officer in charge of the camp, who told them that it was not known that they were Negroes, and that Negroes could not be used in that capacity at the camp.
So there they were, Jim Crowed as hard as any private in a separate regiment, without any reimbursement for the expenses they had incurred, and no jobs. It’s a great country!/p>

 



Letters of protest, demanding the freedom of the Negro sailors on the U.S.S. Philadelphia and an end to the Jim-Crow practices in the Navy, began to pour into the offices of President Roosevelt and Secretary of the Navy Knox last week, at the same time that the government announced its intention of standing by the policy of segregating colored sailors to the mess attendants division only.
The policy of the Navy Department was reiterated in a statement issued by the Bureau of Navigation as follows:
 
Roosevelt’s Policy
“After many years of experience, the policy of not enlisting men of the colored race for any branch of the naval service, except the messmen’s branch, was adopted to meet the best interests of general ship efficiency.
“The selection of men to man the navy is left to. the discretion of the executive branch of the government.
“In the exercise of this discretion. the bureau endeavors to furnish naval vessels with crews consisting of men best qualified to meet the requirements of the special rating and branch to which they are assigned.
“This policy not only serves the best interests of the navy and the country, but serves as well the best interests of the men themselves.”
In plain English, this means that the President of the United States (executive branch) thinks that colored sailors are best qualified to be Jim-Crowed off into the kitchen and servants’ quarters of the Navy, and that this policy helps not only the country, but the Negro sailors as well.
The letters from various organizations and individuals printed in the Pittsburgh Courier last week showed that an increasing number of people are aroused over the case of the imprisoned Philadelphia sailors, and are eager to express their resentment over conditions in the Navy.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in a letter to Secretary Knox stated that the colored people of this country “are bitter about the treatment of their men in the armed forces of the nation ... We wish to enter a most vigorous protest against this action and to request you, as Secretary of the Navy, to intervene.”
The N.A.A.C.P. upheld the action of the mess attendants in bravely signing their names to the published letter of complaint, saying they had done so “in belief that they had a just complaint which ought not to be weakened by an anonymous letter.”
The Courier also quoted from the “pointed letter” to Roosevelt and Knox by the Workers Relief & WPA Union of Newark, N.J., signed by George Breitman, secretary, which asked for an immediate end to the arrest, confinement to the ship for “further investigation,” molestation and inquisition suffered by the boys “whose only ‘offense’ is that they complained with much cause against a brutal system of discrimination and segregation.”
The unemployed union also demanded that Roosevelt and Knox use their powers to put an end to these conditions.
 
Harlem Union Offers Support
Another letter, for Local 32 of the Building Service Employees International Union, signed by J. Cyril Fullerton, executive manager, explained that the union has a membership of 2,000 who reside and work in Harlem, 90 percent of whom are Negroes.
“We feel as you (The Courier) do that Jim-crowism when captioned by that lofty term, ‘The American Way’, or race discrimination even when covered by the American flag to disguise its viciousness ... stinks to the high heavens nonetheless.
“We are definitely united to lend your worthy paper every possible means of support in its drive against this outcropping of injustice which has now come to the surface m the United States Navy.
“We have one aim and that is to see that justice is secured for the colored men in the Navy who are now being unjustly punished for demanding their rights as men and American citizens.”
 
Mess Attendants Expose Aim
Since their arrest, the mess attendants on the Philadelphia have been joined by sailors from at least three other ships who have spoken out and in most cases signed their names, corroborating their testimony about treatment of Negroes in the Navy.
Added to these this week were the names of Negro sailors from two other ships. Those on the U.S.S. Brooklyn, stationed off Mare Island, California, show that they understand what is going on behind the closed doors of the Philadelphia case when they write:
“They are trying to make an example of Johnson and Goodwin (two of the Philadelphia men) to try to scare the rest of us into submission. But these constant letters to you are the only hope Johnson, Goodwin and the rest of us have to get your help, that of the N.A.A.C.P., and other such organizations throughout the country so that this case will not be dropped into obscurity and forgotten by our people while conditions remain the same. We, part of the messmen of the U.S.S. Brooklyn, ... are prepared to sacrifice the time that we have in here and ourselves to help remedy this condition.”
 



We urge our readers to pay particular attention to the articles in this and past issues of the Socialist Appeal, reporting the treatment by the Southern officer caste in the U.S. Navy of Negro sailors who have dared to expose to the world the vicious Jim Crow policies in force on the ships.
A number of these sailors are already in grave danger. To their aid have rallied sailors from other ships who are speaking up in their defense as well as they can, and signing their names too in many cases.
It is our duty on the outside to widely publicize the facts they have bared, to defend: them from punishment, by mass pressure and meetings, and to intensify our agitation for taking control of military training away from the bureaucrats and putting it in the hands of the trade unions.
 

Into The Waste Basket
Last Wednesday we threw into the wastebasket a lot of clippings, some of them a full page in size, from several Negro newspapers, containing the paid advertisements of the Republicans, and editorials from those papers that stumped for Willkie.
We had saved them just on the chance that Willkie might be elected. In that case we were going to use them in comparing his record from week-to-week with his promises.
Because. you see, Willkie was not stingy in this campaign in his promises to the Negroes. Realizing how important the Negro vote was in many key states, he promised them just about everything but socialism.
Lynching? No one looks at it with more condemnation than he does, he said, and furthermore, something should be done about it. A law Should foe passed.
... Jim Crowism? He was against it, he said. If he was elected, he would put an end to it. Yes, he said, he would even fire any of his subordinates “on the spot” if he caught them at it in civil service.
Segregation in the armed forces? He didn’t see any reason for it, he said.
Job discrimination? He didn’t like that either. And if he was elected, he would see to it that Colored men would have equal opportunity to get jobs in private industry.
Unemployment? Of course he was against that too. Just elect him and he would do away with it, and put everybody to work.
Relief? He promised to do away with “the theory that relief is a Negro reservation.” He said he would abolish discrimination in its administration and continue it for those who couldn’t get gainful employment.
These were the promises he made when he was speaking to colored audiences. Of course, he did not say these things when he was speaking in the south, as at Amarillo, Texas.
Nor did he explain why it was that in the utility industries, where he is already “elected,” he has never done anything to wipe out the Jim Crow hiring policies, which either exclude colored workers completely or confine them to common labor. He did not show how he could abolish job discrimination easier as head of the government than as head of a utility corporation.
Nor did he comment on the fact that the promises and general remarks he made now were made pretty much word for word by the Democrats in 1932 and 1936. He did not touch on this at all to show why he would keep these promises in contrast to the Democrats who broke them when they were once elected.
Nor did he spend much time explaining why the Republicans when they controlled Congress completely in 1921–22 killed the Anti-lynch Bill in exactly the same way that the Democrats who completely controlled Congress have been killing it ever since 1937.
Nor did he say much about the right to vote, although he talked a lot about equality, and he did not at all take up the question of how the Republicans have helped the Democrats kill the Geyer Anti-Poll Tax Bill this last year.
But those who were able to, voted, and settled the question. So we threw all these promises in the waste-basket, in the same way Willkie would have throw them in the waste-basket if he was elected, and in the same way that the Democrats have thrown theirs now that they have been elected.
 

Poll Taxes Hit Both
The poll tax laws in operation in eight Southern states kept ten million people from voting in the presidential election last week.
This, says the Afro-American, was in addition “to some five million residents barred from the polls by sheer intimidation.”
These poll tax laws, originally passed to insure lily-white elections and to keep Negroes from exerting any political influence in Southern politics, today serve to disfranchise all workers, white as well as colored.
Most white workers in these states can’t vote there either, because they can’t pay the taxes, which range from $1 to $3. In some states these taxes are cumulative, that is, even workers who paid their taxes this year were not permitted to vote unless they paid up all their back poll taxes, from the time they were 21 years old and on. That means that the longer this thing goes on, the worse it gets, and the more people it robs of their right to vote. How many workers or sharecroppers could raise the money to pay for the years of the depression?
The result is that while almost 60% of the adults in the rest of the country participate in the elections, in these eight Southern states only about 10% can enter the voting booths. And these 10% represent the ruling class, of course.
The whole thing is the best possible proof of our contention that laws aimed against the Negro people inevitably hit and hurt the working class as a whole./p>

 



We think that it will be generally agreed that the shabbiest Uncle Tom sell out o£ the whole electoral campaign was pulled off two weeks ago at the convention of the United Government Employees held in Washington. (This organization, led by Edgar G. Brown, claims a membership of 30,000 Negro federal employees. It also claims to speak in the interests of the Negro people. Both these claims are grossly exaggerated.)
For it was at this convention that the United Government Employees won the “honor” of being the first (and perhaps the only) colored organization in the country to go on record endorsing the vicious Jim Crow policies announced by Roosevelt a half month earlier for the armed forces of the United States.
 

Endorse Segregation
First they endorsed the principle of segregation in the Army. Then they went further. They asked that this principle be extended, that more Jim Crow army divisions be established. The only thing they asked in return was that colored officers, instead of white, be assigned to these divisions.
Not satisfied with segregation in the land forces, the men responsible for the adoption of this position by the U.G.E. then asked that it be extended to the Navy.
In the Navy Negroes can become only waiters and cooks. In this way they are segregated into one part of the ship. Instead of protesting this and demanding that they be permitted into all branches of the service, they asked instead for a separate battleship, cruiser, submarine, destroyer and airplane carrier “to be eventually manned and officered by Negroes.”
In this way they ask for complete segregation! They aren’t satisfied with half-way measures.
Negroes are also barred from the naval academy. Instead of demanding an end to this and equal rights for Negroes at the academy, they asked instead for a separate “Annapolis” in the Virgin Islands.
Of course, it isn’t too hard to figure out why the convention adopted this position. They knew what discrimination and segregation mean to the Negro people—but they weren’t thinking of the Negro people. They were thinking about themselves, and their jobs, and their salaries as government employees.
By telling the colored people, “This is a good thing for us; all we need now is more of it and more colored officers and our problems are solved,” they attempted to keep in office the Administration that signs their pay-checks and wipes its feet on them.
 

What It Really Means
But putting aside for a minute the sordid motives behind it, let’s examine the proposal on its own feet and see how well it stands up.
What people who support such proposals don’t understand is this: The policy of discrimination and segregation in the armed forces places a stamp of approval on discrimination and segregation in civilian life.
When Roosevelt endorsed segregation in the Army, he said in effect: Yes, Negroes are not like other people, they should be placed off on a side, they are inferior, and they should be separated from white men in the Army just as they are separated from them outside the Army.
In other words, the Jim Crow policy in the Army is based on the theories of “inferiority of Negroes” and the “necessity for white supremacy.” Let Mr. Edgar Brown ask any Southern lyncher or Ku Kluxer and they’ll tell him that’s what it is!
Roosevelt, by announcing this policy for the Army, says to the owners of industry, to big business, to relief officials, to movie and restaurant proprietors, and even to some reactionary labor fakers: Sure, go ahead Jim Crowing them, the government, is doing the same!
And Brown and his supporters are themselves now in the position of saying: Roosevelt is right, we don’t deserve equal rights, we should be segregated.
Those who support this position now cannot complain about discrimination in civilian life either. If a reactionary school board in the North wants to send colored children to separate schools, how will Brown be able to argue against it? All !he could do is weakly say: All right, but don’t forget to give us colored teachers in the Jim Crow schools.
 

Lives of Negroes Involved
As long as the Negroes are separated from the white soldiers, it is very easy for the labor-hating officer caste in charge of the Army to pick them out for special assignment and work: as labor battalions, digging trenches and latrines, and as suicide squads, for the most dangerous work, where men’s lives are thrown away cheaply.
This was the practice in the last war, and it will be the practice in this war, as long as the officer caste controls the Army, and as long as Negroes are in separate regiments.
Having Negro officers for these separate regiments will not change matters in this respect at all. They won’t be able to prevent choice of their regiments for dangerous assignments at all.
Consequently, in spite of who the officers are, separate regiments will not protect the Negro soldier from the most important discrimination of all: a high proportion of assignments that endanger his life.
Those who want to protect the Negroes from insult and discrimination must join the struggle for union control of training. This struggle alone will abolish Jim Crowism in the Army, will create the conditions whereby Negroes will be able to enter any regiment, free of discrimination, and officered by workers, black and white, selected by the soldiers themselves./p>

 



(Continued from last week)

Generous – When It Costs Nothing
Will a vote for Willkie and the Republicans be any better than a vote for Roosevelt and the Democrats? The facts say no.
The record of the Republicans on Negro legislation is every bit as bad as the Democrats. From 1920 on the Republicans sat in power, in the White House and in most states. From them the Negroes got nothing. That was why no colored worker spent much time weeping in 1932 when they were swept out of office and became a minority in Congress.
Then overnight, they became “the Negro’s friend and champion”! In a magical way Republicans appeared on the floors of Congress with Anti-Lynch Bills and Anti-Poll Tax Bills. “The Republican Party,” they said, “has been the friend of the Negro people since the days of Abraham Lincoln, and still is. Don’t you see what we’re trying to do for you in Congress?”
What generous people! During the years when they had the power to pass such bills, they were nowhere to be found. The Anti-Lynch Bills which came up in Congress when they had a majority, were always shelved and forgotten by them in the same way the Democrats do it now. And now, when they are sure that the Democratic majority will defeat such legislation, they very boldly propose it!
There are two reasons for this hypocrisy. First, it is a cheap way to build themselves up as “friends of the Negro.” Secondly, it embarrasses the Democrats who have to take the responsibility for laws that neither party really wants passed. Only simple people will fall for this kind of fraud.
Take Wendell Willkie, the utility boss who was picked by that small section of the race that alone is responsible for and benefits from Jim Crow, the bankers and big businessmen.
Because he is an “out” now, and wants to get “in”, he chooses his words about the colored people very carefully. He remembers the eleven states where the colored vote will be decisive on November 5. But every once in a while he makes a slip, and gives the game away, showing that all his fine talk about “equal opportunity” is nothing more than the hot dog and glass of beer that ward-heelers give away “free” before elections.
 

Willkie Likes a Jim Crow Book
Recently the New Jersey Herald News, a Negro paper, addressed an open letter to him. In it they questioned his enthusiastic, praise of the book, Capitalism The Creator, by Carl Snyder. The author of this contemptible book writes in defense of “the greatly misunderstood and abused millionaires.” He vigorously defends the right of plutocrats to keep robbing and exploiting the great mass of the people. He asks that taxation Pf the wealthy be stopped. His reason? They deserve everything they have! He thinks it is terrible for the unions to try to get higher Wages for the workers. That will “block the road to recovery,” he says.
Naturally, such an enemy of the working class is an enemy of the most oppressed section of the working class, the Negro workers, and a friend of Jim Crow. “We must realize that certain races are naturally inferior,” says this ardent champion of the rich. By this he means they shouldn’t have equal opportunities and rights, they should be seen and not heard, they shouldn’t have the same schooliryja they shouldn’t be allowed to sit in the same theaters and restaurants, they should do the dirty work, cleaning the toilets, acting as janitors and washwomen, while their “superiors,” the rich, do more important things such as going to the dog show.
Public endorsement of this book by Willkie means that if he is elected, he can be expected to carry out the ideas in it! And those colored workers who fell for Willkie’s promises before elections will be given the privilege of shining his shoes as reward for their support.
Between the two boss parties the Negro has no choice. Neither will help him, each will betray him, both are his mortal enemies.
 

Trouble – And Double Trouble
The life we live in 1940 is a strange thing.
The workers produce everything, and they live in misery. The bosses produce nothing, and they live in comfort and luxury. Because of the profit system, the bosses make the workers live in unhealthy tenements. Often they shut down the factories and throw the workers into the streets to starve or live on miserable relief allowances. When the workers dare to ask for a little more from life, the strength of the whole system is thrown against them: the laws, the police, the newspapers, the courts. When this decaying profit system faces a crisis, the bosses of the different countries put guns in the workers’ hands and send them out to kill each other to decide which bosses shall get the gravy.
As workers, the Negroes suffer all this. But that isn’t all. Because they are Negroes, they are treated even worse. The Republicans and the Democrats defend this way of life, but they won’t do anything to let the colored workers have at least the same rotten conditions and opportunities that the white workers have. The colored workers are herded into the worst of the bad houses. They are given the dirtiest and worst paying jobs. They are hired last and fired first. They aren’t even permitted to join their bosses’ Army. Many of them are terrorized and lynched when they try to vote like other workers, even for Republicans and Democrats. Insult is always added to the injuries they suffer under capitalism.
Why is this? Why must colored workers carry a double burden?
(Next week: What Causes Jim Crow?)
 



A carefully-conducted poll of a representative group of workers in New Jersey, completed last week, established that a majority of them are in favor of the conscription bill which has just been enacted into law, but that a majority are also in favor of placing military training under, control of the trade unions.
These significant conclusions were the result of a four-week survey among workers in Newark, in a poll conducted by the Newark branch of the Socialist Workers Party.
The material tabulated was secured by visiting the homes of nearly a thousand workers in two representative working class neighborhoods, the Iron-bound section, heavily populated by industrial workers, and the Third and Fourteenth Wards, heart of Newark’s Negro population.
who conducted the poll were extremely careful not to influence the answers given by the workers. Those questioned – chosen at random – were told that a poll of the neighborhood was being made, that their names would not be taken, and that their replies would be kept strictly confidential. They were not told who was conducting the poll before they answered.
They were asked two questions: 1. “Are you in favor of the conscription bill which is now being debated in Congress?” and 2. “Would you be in favor of military training of workers if they were to be trained under supervision of their trade unions?” They could answer to each question, “yes”, “no”, or “don’t know.”
Here are the results in percentages:



 


Yes


      


No


Don’t Know




Question 1


47   


26.7


26.3




Question 2


50.5


22.8


26.7



One thing is startlingly clear from this and other tables which were tabulated from the answers: pacifist tendencies among the workers can hardly be said to exist. Of the whole, only 7 per cent are opposed to both forms of military training! 71.9 per cent favor one or both forms of military training. (The remaining 21%. were against one form and didn’t know about the other, or didn’t know about both forms.)
 
Few Negro Pacifists!
Interestingly enough, when these figures were broken down still further, it was found that pacifist tendencies were even smaller than the general 7 per cent, among union members (4) and Negroes (5.8).
The general conclusions to be drawn from the poll may be formulated as follows:
 
Pacifism Is Bankrupt
Workers are looking for some means of military training. Most of them favored the conscription bill just adopted by Congress because it appeared to them as the answer to the problem of military training. Most of them, however, likewise are in favor of military training under the control of the trade unions, once the idea if presented to them. This is especially true among the employed union-member and Negro sections of the working class – i.e.. the most decisive sections of the labor movement.
The housewives and the unemployed who, by virtue of their status, tend to be less informed and politically developed than the others, give smaller majorities to both forms of military training, but generally show the same tendency as the others. Negro workers show themselves to be particularly receptive to the idea of trade union control of military training.
In the light of these established conclusions, we may say confidently: Woe to the pacifists and semi-pacifists (the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, etc.) who go to the workers walling against conscription, but offering no alternative and progressive system of military training to take its place. These whiners will make no headway, and especially not among the most important sections of the working class.
It is instructive to break down the figures of the poll that show the majority of the workers to be in favor of military training under trade union control. The following were the percentages for the 200 unionists, 421 non-union workers, 308 unemployed-or-housewives, 531 whites and 398 Negroes:



 


Yes


      


No


Don’t Know




Union


61   


17.5


21.5




Non-union working


51.5


27.6


20.9




Unemployed housewives


42.5


19.8


27.7




Whites


46.9


29.9


23.2




Negroes


55.3


13.3


31.4



It is important to point out that practically none of these workers had ever before considered the question of trade union control of military training; it is correct to say that the poll-takers were the first to raise the question in their minds. Consequently, their opinions on this subject were not, of course, as long thought over as their answers on the question of conscription.
 
Instinctively Class Conscious
It would be fair to say, therefore, that for many workers their favorable answer to the question of military training under trade union control was instinctively class conscious. If they thought unions were good, if they felt unions protected or could protect them, they answered yes. And since – as even a recent Fortune poll had to concede – most workers, whether organized or not, favor trade unions, they were struck favorably by the proposition that trade unions should protect them in the sphere of military training as well as in private industry.
Those, however, who felt hostility toward unions for some reason, or felt their own union leaders had failed to protect them on the job, tended to answer no to the proposition that trade unions should control military training. In spite of this, the yes answers were decisive in proportion to those who answered no – almost 5 to 2!
 
Our Program Realistic
On the basis of this poll, which we believe quite accurate – it should be carefully repeated In other parts of the country to check it – it appears to be an established fact, that the Socialist Workers Party’s program for military training under trade union control is a popular and practical basis for winning the workers. Needless to say, it is a program against which the capitalist class will fight like cornered rats.
 




Jim Crow in the Galley
In this week’s issue of the Pittsburgh Courier there is a letter from 15 colored men now serving on the U.S.S. Philadelphia, stationed at Pearl Harbor, in which they bitterly condemn the Jim Crow system in the Navy, and sound a warning to all Negro youth considering entering this branch of the service.
Consider how they must have been driven and aroused, before they would write and sign a letter of this kind – when they are still in the Navy, and still under control of the southern officer caste who run the ship!
They write:
“On enlisting, we are given the same mental and physical examination as the white sailors and given to believe that we have the privilege of choosing any branch of the service the Navy offers. This is not true.
“With three months of training in making beds, shining shoes and serving officers completed, we are sent to various ships and stations of the Navy.
“The white sailor, after completing his training period, is not only eligible for the branch of service he has chosen, but he is automatically advanced in rating and his pay is increased to $36 a month without even having to take an examination.
“In our case, we have to be in the service a full year at $21 a month before we are eligible for advancement rating. It is also necessary for us to take a competitive examination. Even if we pass, it doesn’t mean necessarily that we will be rated and have our pay increased to $36 a month.
“On this ship, out of a crew of 750, there are 18 colored boys. ranging in ages from 18 to 25. They are fresh out of high school and some have a year or two of college education.
“Their work is limited to waiting on table and making beds for the officers.
“In the last nine months there have been nine mess attendants given solitary confinement on bread and water.
“Five of the nine were given brig time because of fighting and arguments with other enlisted men. From this you will probably think we are a pretty bad bunch. We are not.
“With the treading on and kicking around we receive here (without being able to do anything about it), every last one of us becomes bitter enough to fight a member of our own family.
“We, the mess attendants of the Philadelphia, are not merely stating these facts because of our own plight. In doing so, we sincerely hope to discourage any other colored boys from joining the Navy and make the same mistake we did.
“All they would became is sea-going bell hops, chambermaids and dishwashers.
“We take it upon ourselves to write this letter, regardless of any action the Naval authorities may take or whatever the consequences may be.
“We only know that it could not possibly surpass the mental cruelty inflicted upon us on this ship.”
And the letter ends with their signatures.
The same bitter story is told in an anonymous article in the July issue of The Crisis, monthly magazine of the N.A.A.C.P., written by a colored man on a warship whose home station is Long Beach, California.
 

U.S. Government’s Color Line
It points out that contrary to popular belief:
“Negroes cannot become petty officers or chief petty officers. The highest rank that can be obtained is officers’ cook or steward, and even though a steward, one is still looked upon as a mess attendant.”
“After all, he is a mess attendant. Just a mess attendant. Or shall we say ‘officer’s boy’. His duties consist of serving officers’ meals, cleaning officers’ rooms, shining their shoes, checking their laundry, running errands for them, caring for their uniforms, etc.”
“The white officer is usually the type to persecute. He can and does make your career difficult for you, because he knows that you cannot defend yourself.
“Our Negro sailors should he warned never to show a spark of intelligence if they want to spend four years in the navy. Everyone does his best to keep a smart Negro ‘in his place’. If one doesn’t mind being insulted by his superiors, if he is the kind that wants to be the rag under the white man’s feet, if he is willing to stand by while others make ratings, then he is the type the navy wants. He is the type that will make a success as a messman.
“Most Negroes find that four years in the navy is much too much for them. Proof of this fact is evident in the fact that only 1% re-enlist for another four years. This shows conclusively the attitude of the modern Negro toward white supremacy and bigotry.”
“I would like to offer one suggestion, as this situation deeply concerns every Negro in America. Let’s not sit and talk, and wait for sympathy. The Navy department, and the government, can and will give you your equal rights when, and only when, you have fought and successfully demanded them.”
Fight against Jim Crow in the armed forces by demanding workers’ control of military training and service!
 



(Continued from last week)

Divide and Rule
The reason for Jim Crow and Judge Lynch is to be found in the desire of the bosses to protect and increase their profits. They do this by paying their workers as little wages and making them work as long hours as possible. The workers form unions in an attempt to improve their conditions. The bosses spend a lot of time, energy and money trying to prevent formation of unions and to weaken and smash them where they exist.
The best way they know to accomplish this is by keeping the workers divided. Each worker alone is weak, and if he raises his voice, can be kicked out easily. United, all the workers are strong – much stronger than all the bosses put together. This explains the strategy of the bosses: keep the workers divided and fighting among themselves so that they will be unable to fight their real enemy, the bosses. And so the boss pits white worker against colored in the same way that he stirs up Christian against Jew, and “citizen” against “alien”. He doesn’t do this ’because he likes the white worker better, but because he dislikes both.
 

Unite and Fight
Many white workers don’t recognize this because the bosses spread their Jim Crow propaganda skillfully. These backward workers accept these lies about their colored brothers and permit themselves to be used by the bosses in spreading discrimination and segregation. In this way they not only hurt the colored workers, but they also hurt themselves. As a result, colored workers not only have to fight the bosses, but they have to fight against the prejudices of many backward workers and to try to educate them.
Difficult as this job is, still it is what the colored workers have to do with the help of the advanced white workers who understand these things. There is no other way. They cannot turn their backs on the unions, because the only way they can end Jim Crow as well as the evils of capitalism is by fighting side by side with the white workers, their natural allies in the fight against the common enemy. Alone, they can never defeat the bosses.
If they turn away from this hard and often unpleasant task, they will only be helping the bosses keep the workers divided. Into the unions the Negroes must go, and they must be the best fighters against the bosses, so that the backward workers will learn from real life how they have been misled and tricked.
Unite and fight! Unite with the white workers and fight against the bosses and Jim Crow!
 

Build a Labor Party
The Democrats and Republicans defend and preserve the system of Jim Crow that is used to maintain capitalism. This explains why neither party has done anything in all the years they have been in office to abolish or even weaken Jim Crow. It would be foolish to expect anything different from them this year.
What the Negro workers must do now is turn their backs on both these parties, the same way that these parties have turned their backs on them when it came to the Anti-Lynch Bill and similar measures.
What they must do now, together with the white workers, is build a new party, a Labor Party, controlled and run by the workers in it, presenting an independent program defending the interests of all workers, and running labor candidates, Negro and white, against the candidates of big business.
 

The Socialist Workers Party
The Socialist Workers Party calls on the Negro workers to join with it in the struggle against the bosses. It calls on them to support its candidates in the elections in those places where they are on the ballot. It calls on them to fight for its program on election day and every other day in the year:
Against Jim Crow! For full social, political and economic equality of the Negro people!
For the right of Negroes to sit in the movies and restaurants when they want to. For their right to vote, and to run for office. For their right to belong to trade unions and other organizations of their choice. For their equal right to jobs in industry, at equal pay. For an end to the “deportation to the South” laws which deny them relief. For the passage of the Anti-Lynch and Anti-Poll Tax Bills.
Against the war! Against the Jim Crow practices in the Army! For military training under control of the trade unions!
For the government to appropriate money for a system of military training under control of the trade union movement, to teach the workers the use of arms so that they will be able to protect themselves against their enemies at home and abroad. For the right to the soldier-workers to elect their own officers from out of their own ranks, colored and white. For an end to the discriminatory practices which give Negroes the flunkey jobs in the Army and deny them the right to advance themselves.
Against the profit system that breeds Jim Crow! For a workers’ government that will forever end discrimination and segregation.
 



Recently, Roscoe Dunjee, editor of The Black Dispatch, made the keynote address before the National Colored Democratic Association, in the course of which he said tire following:
“I want to insist here and now that as American citizens we demand the right to be integrated into every branch of the American Army. Recently I appeared before the resolutions committee of the Oklahoma Democratic State Convention ...
“When I did get an opportunity to talk I told that committee about the obvious discrimination in the American Army. I told them how Pat Hurely, from my state, when Secretary of War under Herbert Hoover, had practically demobilized all of the Negro combat troops of the Army. I told them that at Fort Sill, in my state, and at Fort Riley in Kansas, Negroes were nothing more than manure handlers. I told them that if Hitler was going to come over here, Negroes wanted to be armed with something else other than a mop and a broom.
“The Republican Party under Herbert Hoover struck at the Negro’s right to fight for this country and we want to ask our party convention this year to put a gun in the black man’s hands. We want the right to fight in the Army, Navy, the air, and the National Guard ...”
Dunjee correctly puts part of the blame for the Jim Crow conditions in the armed forces on the Republicans, who today are promising the Negroes everything they can think of ... that may possibly win them a vote.
But how he prostitutes himself when he pretends that the Democrats are any better in this respect! Assume for a minute that the Republicans were solely responsible for these conditions. The Democrats have had eight years now to correct them, haven’t they?
Talking about that reminds us about the committee of Frank Crosswaith, William Pickens and Alfred Baker Lewis, who signed that rotten article, Colored Americans Have a Stake in the War, issued as war propaganda by the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies.
We’ll discuss that article again in future weeks. Here we’ll limit ourselves to George Schuyler’s comment on it in the Pittsburgh Courier of Oct. 12: “They speak of the Hitler menace to freedom of speech, press and assemblage, forgetting all about Georgia, Louisiana and Alabama. They say the NAACP would be illegal under Hitler, forgetting how dangerous is membership therein in the Deep South outside of a few cities, one member having recently been lynched outside of Brownsville, Tenn.
“Ironically enough, in proof of the fact that British imperialism ‘is softening’, they boast that in Jamaica, Bustamente, a prominent Negro trade unionist and radical, has had freedom to organize and agitate even under British imperialism ... In Germany or Italy, Bustamente would have been put in a concentration camp or perhaps executed ...’
“Here’s the laugh on that ... Last week several Negro newspapers announced that Bustament HAS been thrown into a concentration camp.”
 




A Victory on Paper
A couple of weeks ago, before the conscription bill was passed, two amendments were made, which were hailed by Senator Wagner of New York (and several unsuspecting and gullible Negro leaders) as “a signal victory for the forces of democracy in America life.”
One amendment was supposed to prohibit discrimination in the armed forces because of color, so far as enlisted men were concerned, the other prohibited discrimination against drafted men.
But actually, in spite of the statements coming from secretaries in the White House, nothing has changed. Jim Crow still wears his stripes.
This was definitely shown in the attempts of a number of colored people to enlist in the service since the passage of the amended bill. They wanted to enlist so that they can choose the branch of the service they preferred, something that is not permitted for drafted men.
In five cities, reporters of the Baltimore Afro-American attempted to join the U.S. Aviation Corp. In each case, these colored men were met with flat rejections. “And in each instance the reason given was always the same – no openings for colored men.”
Another reporter of the same paper tried to enlist in the field artillery, a branch of the service that has been closed to the Negro people. “There are no vacancies for colored,” was the answer he got.
Another applied for admission into the U.S. Navy this week in Washington, the capital of this great democracy. He was told that the only place open for Negroes was as mess-hands, that is, as kitchen slavies. He protested, saying, “I was of the impression that the conscription bill, either in fact or in spirit, had changed all this segregation.”
“Well,” the officer declared, “I don’t know what can be done about it. We haven’t had any further orders. The conscription bill hasn’t changed the situation for us. As far as we’re concerned, it’s just as if nothing’s happened.”
And so it goes, up and down the line of the different branches. The marine corps is still lily white. So is the tank corps, the air corps, the artillery, the coast guard, the engineers, the signal corps, etc. Only the infantry, the cavalry, the quartermaster corps, mess hands in the Navy, and to a very limited extent, the medical corps are open to colored people.
 

The White House Is Unmasked
After a White. House conference with Walter White, A. Philip Randolph and T. Arnold Hill, it became clear this week that only white officers will be called in to command colored draftees. Roosevelt was quoted as saying That so far as training colored men as commissioned officers or for the air corps went, plans had not yet been developed.
Colored reserve officers will be called on active duty only to fill vacancies “in units now officered by colored personnel.” Since the only units now officered by colored men are the National Guard, this means that drafted men will be placed in separate units under white officers.
“As to the Navy,” says the Afro-American, “Colonel Knox allegedly stated that while he was sympathetic, he felt that the problem there was almost insoluble since men have to live together on ships, and that ‘Southern’ and ‘Northern’ ships are impossible.”
If Jim Crow still rules in the enlisted Army, in spite of the fine “anti-discrimination” amendment, how much more will it rule in the drafted army! It becomes clear now that the only reason these amendments were passed was to get the colored people to support the conscription bill, and make them feel things were going to change so far as they were concerned.
... It is now clearer than ever: The fight to end Jim Crowism in the armed forces, the fight to see that colored soldiers have the right to pick their own officers, can be won only as part of the general struggle for trade union control of military training.
* * *
The Army doesn’t want colored men to become officers. And it has an unwritten rule that those who do become officers shall not rise higher than the rank of Colonel. And few of those!
The reason is that they don’t want colored men in the highest councils where they can see from the inside how the Negro ranks are discriminated against, how it is decided that they are to play mainly two roles: to do the dirty work in the labor battalions, and to be given the most dangerous assignments in active duty.
In 1917, when officers were being promoted, General Jim Crow and his staff decided that Colonel Charles E. Young, highest ranking Negro West Point graduate, was suddenly retired “because he had high blood pressure.” The real reason for this move was that an officer who is retired does not have to be promoted, even if he is returned to active duty.
Young rode on a horse all the way from Wilberforce, Ohio, to Washington, to show that he was physically fit – but he was not promoted as all the whites of his rank were. Later on, he was returned to active duty, but only as a colonel, because his “retirement” gave the general staff their necessary excuse not to advance him.
History repeated itself last week. President Roosevelt, who tells how he loves democracy ... in Europe, appointed 100 white colonels to the grade of brigadier-general over the head of Col. Benjamin O. Davis, commanding officer of the 369th Infantry Regiment, N.Y. These appointments were made by the Commander-in-Chief on the recommendation of the Army.
The only difference is that in 1917 they looked for an “excuse.” In 1940 they feel Jim Crow is permanent in the Army, as long as they’re in control, and they don’t even need excuses to cover it up.
 




[Supreme Court]
Many of the same people who are today asking Roosevelt to please, please, issue an executive order abolishing racial discrimination in all governmental spheres, are the same people who were appealing to him only a few months ago to please, please, not appoint Senator James F. Byrnes, South Carolina Democrat and open enemy of the Negro people, to the Supreme Court. Please, please, doesn’t get very far.

The Aviation Strike
J.H. Kindelberger, president and general manager of North American Aviation, Inc., who last week said of the strikers in his plant: “I don’t have to pay any more to my workers because most of them are young kids who spend their money on a flivver and a gal,” is the same man who recently stated about the North American plant being built in Kansas City: “Under no circumstances will Negroes be employed as aircraft workers or mechanics” – and that they would be hired only as janitors “regardless of their training as aircraft workers.”
This is also the man of whom Secretary of War Stimson declared last week: “There are not enough like him. We do not want to do injury to such a man.”
There were no Negroes employed by North American Aviation before the strike, when Kindelberger and the bosses were running the place. Now, when the government’s army is runnimg it, there are still no Negroes there and there is little likelihood that Roosevelt’s army will permit Negroes to get jobs there during the period that they remain in control. It won’t be until the workers themselves control the plants through democratically elected committees from the ranks of labor that Negroes will be able to secure employment in industry on a truly equal basis!
* * *
In last week’s Pittsburgh Courier, columnist Marjorie McKenzie complains that the present Administration has sidestepped the question of the Negro, and “we have been beguiled by some beautiful words and phrases” from Roosevelt. She also points out’ that under his present “emergency” powers Roosevelt could issue an executive order banning discrimination.
Then follow many sentences such as these:
“Our President is a man in whom the imagination leaps and dares beyond the puny dreams of those who follow his star. There is a course open to him as the Defender of Democracy which would commit him safely to the immortal company of men like Jefferson and Lincoln ... What surging, thrilling feeling would come to his heart and mind, should he pause to realize that with a simple, everyday gesture like signing an executive order, he could free thirteen million American men and women from slavery. Lincoln freed only three and a half million! ...” etc. etc.
Evidently Miss McKenzie thinks that she can “beguile” Roosevelt “by some beautiful words and phrases.”
 

William Pickens on His New Job
William Pickens is on the job! He is determined to keep that $500 a month job he has with the Treasury Department selling “Defense Bonds” to Negroes. From his first broadside, one would think that he has now solved all the problems of the Negro people. For he promises them everything – if only they will buy his bonds.
Why, if they spend the few dollars Jim Crow permits them to get, they will not only eat their cake, but they can have it too, he promises.
“Say, you are of small means, and you want to buy a $25 Bond. You have not the $25 to spare, you only earn $25 in a third of a month or half a month. But, you can always spare a dime, maybe a quarter. Therefore you begin by Saving Stamps for 10c or 25c. When you have bought enough to total $18.75, you buy a U.S. Government security worth $25 in a few years – and you, don’t have to keep it any longer than 60 days, in case you come to need the money badly. But every year you keep that $18.75 investment, the bigger it becomes.”
Thus, here is the economic answer to the Negroes. Why get all excited about jobs and equality in industry? Why hold picket-lines and demonstrations against Jim Crowism? Just buy Pickens’ “defense bonds,” and live off the fat of the land.
Pickens goes on:
“And that is not all: You are helping to defend your money and your OTHER property, and all your precious liberties, when you put that money into the U.S. Treasury. You, as a colored citizen, strike a blow at Hitler, who says that you are but a half ape ... You would be helping to give Mussolini the final kick out of Ethiopia, and to restore that country to its own black people. You. would be strengthening the position of your race in American citizenship ...”
Giving money to the Jim Crow government that treats you as though you are a half-ape, is that fighting Hitler? Fight Mussolini by giving money to a Jim Crow government that suppresses the American Negroes? Strengthen the position of your race in American citizenship by supporting the bosses’ government that treats you as a second-class citizen ? Pickens knows better. But that’s his job.

Dean Gordon Hancock, author of the column Between The Lines in the Chicago Sunday Bee, has a faculty for standing things on their head. In one of his latest outbursts, he says:
“Hitler has already served notice to the world what the Negro need expect. In the persecution of the Jews the Negro has been given a pattern of his estate under Hitlerism.”
But Hitler only applied to the Jews of Europe the treatment he observed applied in this democracy to the several million Negroes in the South.
 



A committee of prominent Negroes, headed by A. Philip Randolph, President of the Brotherhood of Pullman Porters, is now engaged in furthering a march on Washington, which is scheduled to take place on July 1st.
Randolph has correctly described the national industrial and military situation:
“The whole National Defense Set-up reeks and stinks with race prejudice, hatred and discrimination ...
“Responsible committees of Negroes who seek to intercede in behalf of the Negro being accorded the simple right to work in industries and on jobs serving National Defense and to serve in the Army, Navy and Air Corps, are given polite assurance that Negroes will .he given a fair deal. But it all ends there. Nothing is actually done to stop discrimination.
“It seems to be apparent that even when well-meaning, responsible, top government officials agree upon a fair and favorable policy, there are loopholes, and subordinate officers in the Army, Navy and Air Corps, full of race hatred, who seek its contravention, nullification and evasion.”
Randolph has had to recognize the impotence and weaknesses of the current Negro leadership and their methods, even though he has many words of praise for them:
“Evidently, the regular, normal and respectable method of conferences and petitions, while proper and ought to be continued as conditions warrant, certainly don’t work. They don’t do the job.”
And, on the same theme, in another article:
“Negroes cannot stop discrimination in National Defense with conferences of leaders and the intelligentsia alone. While conferences have merit, they won’t get desired results by themselves.”
Randolph states the need for organization and action by the Negro masses:
“Power and pressure do not reside in the few, the intelligentsia, they lie in and flow from the masses. Power does not even rest with the masses as such. Power is the active principle of only the organized masses, the masses united for a definite purpose.”
And then he calls for action in the form of a march of 10,000 Negroes to Washington:
“On to Washington, ten thousand black Americans! Let them swarm from every hamlet, village and town; from the highways and byways, out of the churches, lodges, homes, schools, mills, mines, factories and fields. Let them come in automobiles, buses, trains, trucks and on foot. Let them come though the winds blow and the rains beat against them, when the date is set. We shall not call upon our white friends to march with us. There are some things Negroes must do alone. This is our fight and we must see it through. If it costs money to finance a march on Washington, let Negroes pay for it. If any sacrifices are to be made for Negro rights in national defense, let Negroes make them. If Negroes fail this chance for work, for freedom and training, it may never come again. Let the Negro masses speak!”
 
Why We Support the March
The Socialist Workers Party, the Trotskyist movement in this country, was among the first to hail the progressive character of the proposal to march on Washington.
It should be obvious, however, that our support of a march on Washington does not depend on any of Randolph’s ideas at all. We support a militant action, not Randolph’s reasons for it. We do this in the same way that we would support a strike of the union of which Randolph is president, in spite of our sharp differences with Randolph on many basic questions.
That is to say, our support of the march, while full and wholehearted, is not uncritical. We feel it our duty, as part of our fight for full social, economic and political equality for the Negroes, to indicate mistakes and shortcomings where we see them, and to urge Negro militants to correct them.
Randolph says again and again in his articles: “Let the masses speak.” But the masses had nothing to say about the composition of the Committee or its functions. This Committee has taken on itself the sole right of determining the slogans to be used and the work to be done in Washington.
A representative conference should have been called together before the final plans were adopted. At such a conference, representatives of different organizations that want to participate in the march could have worked out policy and strategy and elected a leading committee. This would have enabled participating organizations to help work out the policy, instead of putting them in a position, as Randolph has done, where they have only the choice of carrying out the Randolph Committee’s decisions or just not participating. Such a conference would have increased not only the publicity for the march, but it would also have improved the morale of those participating. The Negro workers would then really have felt that this was their march; something that is not truly accomplished by the mere device of excluding white workers.
Nor can Randolph object that “there wasn’t time for that; we’d have wasted valuable time.” This is not true. There was plenty of time for it between the time Randolph first presented the proposal in January and the time the hand-picked Committee issued the call in May.
Furthermore, at the time this is written, during the first week in June, less than a month before the march is to take place, there is no evidence that the masses, even on the eastern seaboard, have yet been reached and aroused by the organizers of the march. Most workers haven’t even heard about it.
It is to be hoped that, in spite of the slow beginning, the masses and especially the workers in the trade unions, will be mobilized to support the march during the weeks that still remain. The Socialist Workers Party is doing what it can to influence advanced workers to participate in this action. But if the march fails because of lack of support from the workers, it will be directly attributable to the bureaucratic organization of the whole affair.
In spite of many militant words, the Committee’s Call To Negro America suffers from the same half-heartedness that has characterized the other attempts by “respectable” Negro leaders to win concessions.
Certainly one of the key questions to be faced by any movement is the question of the war and the capitalist demand for “National Unity.” The exploiters mean that the workers should stop asking for higher wages and better conditions until the war is over. For the Negroes “National Unity” means suspension of the fight for equal rights until after the war is over.
The Randolph Committee has no forthright answer to this question. Instead, it says:
“But what of national unity? We believe in national unity which recognizes equal opportunity of black and white citizens to jobs in national defense and the armed forces, arid in all other institutions and endeavors in America. We condemn all dictatorships, Fascist, Nazi and Communist. We are loyal, patriotic Americans, all.
“But, if American democracy will not defend its defenders; if American democracy will not protect its protectors; if American democracy will not give jobs to its toilers because of race or color; if American democracy will not insure equality of opportunity, freedom and justice to its citizens, black and white, it is a hollow mockery and belies the principles for which it is supposed to stand.”
Why all those ifs? Don’t the Committee’s members know very well what is going on? Is there any real doubt in their minds as to exactly what is happening to the Negro? Hidden behind the ifs is a potential surrender of the fight for the rights of the Negro people. The bosses will think: “Never fear; this. is only another bunch of people who are urging us to be good, but who are pledging their loyalty in advance.”
Because the Committee is afraid to take an out-and-out position on this question, it weakens the effectiveness of the march. There can be only one correct answer to “National Unity”: unity of the Negroes with the white worker against their common enemy and exploiter.
This is not the only instance of the Call for the march making concessions to the ideas looked on with favor by the ruling class. In another place it says:
“However we sternly counsel against violence and ill-considered and intemperate action and the abuse of power. Mass power, like physical, when misdirected, is more harmful than helpful.
“We summon you to mass action that is orderly and lawful, but aggressive and militant, for justice, equality and freedom.
“Crispus Attucks marched and died as a martyr for American independence. Nat Turner, Demark Vesy, Gabriel, Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass fought bled and died for the emancipation of Negro slaves and the preservation of American democracy.”
Our criticism of this section of the Call should not be mistaken to mean that the Socialist Workers Party is in favor of “ill-considered and intemperate action” or anything of the kind. Not at all.
But who is served by this reassurance that everything is going to be nice and respectable and within the “lawful” bounds established by the ruling class and its anti-labor, Jim Crow legislatures and courts?
If we are going to talk about history, let us talk about it correctly. Did King George the Third think that Crispus Attucks’ action was “lawful”? Did the slaveholders of Virginia think that Nat Turner was “orderly”?
The trouble is that the Randolph Committee members are too much concerned about what the powers that be may think about them. And as long as that is true, they lead a halfhearted fight, in spite of all their talk about agressiveness and militancy.
 
What Shall the Marchers Demand?
The central demand of the Committee is that Roosevelt issue an executive order abolishing discrimination in all government departments, the armed forces and on all jobs holding government contracts. This Roosevelt will be asked to do when he is asked to address the marchers. The local demonstrations are supposed to ask their city councils to memorialize the president to issue such an order.
To fully understand this proposal, one should read the article written by Randolph himself, explaining the theory behind this demand. Printed in the April 12th Afro-American, it began this way:
“President Roosevelt can issue an executive order tomorrow to abolish discrimination in the Army, Navy, Air Corps, Marine, and on all defense contracts awarded by the Federal Government, on account of race or color, and discriminations against colored people would promptly end.” (Our emphasis).
If Randolph’s statement means anything at all, it means that discrimination and segregation continue to exist in the government, the armed forces and in industry, only because the President hasn’t issued an order abolishing discrimination and segregation.
Can Randolph really believe that? He must know that Jim Crowism does not depend for its existence on the lack of executive orders abolishing it. Jim Crowism exists because it serves the interests of the capitalist ruling class to keep the working class divided and split along racial lines.
We are ready to support the Randolph Committee’s demand for President Roosevelt to issue an executive order abolishing discrimination. To force him to issue such an order would be a step forward in the struggle for abolition of racial discrimination. But only a step. Roosevelt’s executive order would not be so very much more weighty than the laws and rulings and orders already on the books prohibiting discrimination. In spite of them, Jim Crow rides high.
Randolph should recall one of the statements he made when he first called for the march:
“... even when ... top government officials agree upon a fair and favorable policy, there are loopholes, and subordinate officers in the Army, Navy, and Air Corps, full of race hatred, who seek its contravention, nullification, and evasion.”
How can Randolph square his January statement with his statement in April that a presidential decree would “promptly” end discrimination?
An executive order abolishing discrimination would remain largely on paper, as long as control of industry, military training and the government remain in the hands of the enemies of the Negroes.
A movement that denies these facts or tries to ignore them cannot successfully lead the struggle for full equality. A movement that shuts its eyes or refuses to open them is good only for sleeping.
 
The Workers, Black and White, Must Control
Negroes must fight for more than a presidential executive order. They must fight for a program that will take control out of the hands of the enemies of the Negro people.
Employers controlling the war industries won’t hire Negroes? Then have the government take those industries over, and let them be managed and operated without discrimination by committees elected by the workers!
Negroes need military training in this epoch when all major questions are decided arms in hand. But the army bureaucrats are bitterly anti-Negro and determined to “keep them in their place.” Therefore, Negroes must join the fight for military training, financed by the government but under control of the trade unions, based on full equality for the Negroes!
The government and the capitalist parties aid the bosses in segregating and discriminating against the Negro people, refusing to pass such elementary legislation as punishing lynching and granting the Negroes in the South the right to vote. Therefore aid in the formation of an independent labor party pledged to carry on the Negroes’ struggles. An independent labor party pledged to establish a Workers’ and Farmers’ Government that would create a new society that would forever abolish poverty, war and racial discrimination!
Such a program, aimed at putting control of their destiny into the hands of the workers themselves, black and white – in military training, in industry, in politics – this must become the program of the militant Negro workers. This is the road to jobs and equality.
The Negro misleaders will say that this program is impractical and Utopian. That is what Uncle Tom said about freedom for the slaves.
But the fighting program we propose is infinitely more realistic than expecting Roosevelt – the partner of the Southern Democrats, ally of the British Empire which oppresses Negroes on every continent – to abolish discrimination.
The Socialist Workers Party supports the march on Washington. We call on the negro workers to bring forward in the march a really militant program. If this is done, the march on Washington, whatever its immediate results, would serve to be an important stage in the fight to change the world.




His Friends Write to Roosevelt
Not long ago an, open letter to President Roosevelt was published in the California Eagle, sighed by several members of the Randolph Committee sponsoring the July 1 March On Washington, including Randolph himself, Frank Crosswaith, Walter White, and others such as William Pickens and Elmer Carter.
“As persons who are sympathetic to your social and labor policies and friendly to your foreign policy of giving effective aid to Britain and her Allies,” they tell Roosevelt, they ask him to use his influence to help Negroes get jobs and equal rights. The letter as a whole is very friendly. Even in its last sentence, where a note of reproach might have entered, there is only a certain mournfulness as they state:
“Those who practice or complacently tolerate race discrimination are not ‘all out’ believers in democracy; and we solemnly warn you and our fellow citizens that they will prove untrustworthy in the hour of democracy’s greatest trials.”
If it weren’t for the seriousness of the problems involved, you would certainly be forced to describe as comical this “friendly,” “solemn,” respectable letter. You would never think that this letter was addressed by Negroes to the man who after eight years in office has yet to utter a syllable one way or the other about the anti-lynch and poll tax bills!
I mention it, rather, to demonstrate an approach to the problem of destroying Jim Crowism, which must be studiously avoided by all class conscious and militant Negroes.
Here we do not refer to that servile tone employed by the misleaders, nor to their disgusting habit of lauding Roosevelt as “a great humanitarian and idealist” – but rather to the question of the general strategic approach.
 

What The Uncle Toms Are Saying
Observant Negroes must have noticed that every time the Uncle Toms discuss the question of the fight against Jim Crowism, they try to separate it off from all the other fights of the masses, they try to present the question of race discrimination as though it is the only, or the only important, problem to be solved.
“This country,” they say, “is the finest in the world; this government is the finest in the world. There is only one thing wrong: Negroes are not given a fair and square deal.”
Following this line, they go on: “Because it is the best government, we must defend it, and we must support it in any war it enters. Not only is this necessary to us as patriotic Americans, but it has an added advantage in that we can more effectively appeal to the government for a fair deal, and in this way we will get concessions, and in the end, equal rights.”
In other words, the only thing wrong with American capitalism is Jim Crowism. Remove that, and although you leave everything else untouched, you will find paradise on earth. This is the theoretical basis for the general approach of the Negro misleaders.
But this is false through and through. The problems of the Negro workers would not be solved even under a capitalist system that was in some way magically cleansed of racial discrimination and segregation. The Negro masses would still have to contend with the questions of war, unemployment, fascism and all the other critical problems that the white workers face.
 

The Real Fight Against Jim Crow
No one should accuse us, on reading the above, of underestimating the paramount importance of the struggle against Jim Crowism. We are the first to declare that the workers must wipe it out in every nook and cranny of every institution, and we are proud to take our place in the militant struggle for full social, economic and political equality for the Negro people. As a matter of fact, we are the best fighters in this struggle precisely because of the fact that we understand clearly the connection between the roots and cause of Jim Crowism and the capitalist system which uses it to maintain itself and to oppress the divided masses.
The misleaders base themselves on the idea that it is possible to wipe out Jim Crowism gradually within the confines of capitalist rule. We base ourselves on the understanding that the struggle against Jim Crowism is an outstanding part of the wider struggle to replace capitalism with a socialist society. The misleaders pretend or believe that it is possible by peaceful means, petitions, respectable demonstrations and even flattery to win equality. We contend that Jim Crowism even in the North will not be wiped out until it is wiped out in the South, and that only a far-from-peaceful fight will destroy Jim Crowism in the South where most of the social, political and economic relations are based directly on the oppression of the Negro. In fact, we can safely say that only another Civil War will end the rule of the Southern Bourbons.
Actions flow from our basic concepts and theories. The actions of the misleaders are based on their concepts too. Real life is everyday proving how false they are, and we would not waste much time on them if it weren’t for this important fact: By isolating the struggle against Jim Crowism from all the other legitimate and necessary struggles of the masses, they are weakening the struggle against Jim Crowism itself.
We, on the other hand, because we recognize the fight against discrimination as part of the fight against capitalism, show on every occasion the interconnection between these struggles, so that we can mobilize the white workers side by side with the Negro workers for the solution of their joint problems. It is only in this way, unity of black and white, that capitalism and Jim Crowism can be overthrown.
 



As the day of the July 1st Negro March on Washington draws closer, numerous attempts are being made to exert pressure, on the organizers of the march to call it off.
These attempts include “advice” and hardly-veiled threats from so-called friends, government officials and Negro misleaders.
The coming March on Washington has the government worried. It will be a strong and telling condemnation of the hypocritical talk about saving the world for democracy. The refusal to grant the just and simple demands of the marchers will be a real eye-opener to hundreds of thousands of Negroes as to the true character of the Roosevelt administration and the war it is preparing.
The main gun in this drive to stifle the March was fired by Roosevelt himself, in his memorandum to the OPM on Negro employment.
Roosevelt hoped that this memorandum would satisfy the leaders of the March and persuade them to call off the march.
But the leaders of the March just could not do this, when so little had actually been offered by Roosevelt.
 
Answers to Roosevelt
A. Philip Randolph declared:
“The statement of the President is one which was expected 10 months ago. It has no teeth in it and its not a proclamation or executive order which would give assurance of discontinuance of discrimination. Therefore the mobilization effort for the march on Washington is being redoubled.”
Walter White of the NAACP stated that “the president’s statement is about six months late. What Negroes want now is action, not words.”
Later in the week, unfortunately, both Randolph and White began to give in a little under the pressure of Washington but both still asserted that the march would go through as planned. Randolph said: “It is not only the president who must be impressed with the gravity of the Negro situation ...” White said: “The president’s memorandum, sound and democratic in principle, is too little when one considers the areas it leaves untouched, and comes too late to convince the Committee that a mass demonstration isn’t needed to dramatize race discrimination in the nation’s life.” After all, Randolph and White were also under pressure from the Negro people who want the march.
 
Masses for March
An example of how the masses responded to the cry that the Roosevelt memorandum was a victory was shown in the statement by one of the rank-and-file members of the Harlem March committee who said: “Even if this is a victory, that’s no reason why we can’t hold a victory demonstration in Washington!”
(On Page 5 of this issue is an analysis of the President’s memorandum.)
 
Eleanor Intervenes
The administration did not content itself with utilizing the services of the male half of the family. After all, while Roosevelt has kept quiet on all these questions for years, his wife has built herself quite a reputation as a “friend of the Negroes.” So she too. went into action.
First she wrote a letter to Randolph:
“I have talked over your letter with the President and I feel very strongly that your group is making a very grave mistake at the present time to allow this march to take place. I am afraid it will set back the progress which is being made, in the Army at least, towards better opportunities and less segregation.
“I feel that if any incident occurs as a result of this, it may engender so much bitterness that it will create in Congress even more solid opposition from certain groups than we have had in the past ...”
This was followed by a surprise visit by Mrs. Roosevelt to New York, where, in LaGuardia’s office she and the Little Flower at tempted to persuade Randolph and White in person.
Randolph and White were not convinced, they said afterwards, but they certainly did not help the march any when they issued Mrs. Roosevelt’s letter a little later with the brief statement that the march would produce beneficial results, but presenting her letter as the expression of “an important point of view from not only an influential person in American affairs but a strong and definite friend of the Negro. There is no question that can rise in the minds of the Negroes about the fact that she is a real and genuine friend of the race.”
By not answering point for point what she had said, and by characterizing her as a “friend of the race,” Randolph and White weaken the fight.
 
Eleanor’s “Friendly” Threat
Eleanor Roosevelt’s letter is not that of “a friend,” but that of an enemy disguising herself as a friend. For what is her letter but a half-threat? A half-threat that the march will “set back the progress which is being made, in the Army at least” (what progress?). What is this talk of hers about “an incident”? Who will create the incident? Not the marchers. If any “incident” occurs, it will be brought about by the administration or its underlings. All Roosevelt need do to prevent any “incidents” when the marchers arrive in Washington, is grant their demands. It is significant that when Mrs. Roosevelt spoke to her husband, she evidently did not try to persuade him that he should do this, and thus avoid “incidents.”
It is just because she has the reputation of being a “friend” that Randolph and White should have taken extra steps to expose her letter and her attitude, and to explain that if she were a friend of the Negroes she would spend more time trying to convince her husband to grant the demands of the Negroes and less trying to convince the Negroes to withdraw their demands.
 
Uncle Tom Whines
Congressman Arthur Mitchell, only Negro member of Congress, chimed in and attacked the march too. The effects of this, of course, will be little, inasmuch as Mitchell has completely discredited himself before the Negroes by his endorsement of Roosevelt’s appointment of Negro-hating Senator Byrnes to the Supreme Court.
The official cabinet members and their “family” followed up with telegrams to Randolph, urging him to come to Washington to meet with Stimson and Knox. The Chicago Defender states:
“Though the purposes of the conferences were not mentioned in the invitations, it was expected that both secretaries would offer to correct some of the abuses which have angered Negroes if the parade plans are abandoned.”
 
March Already Justified
Thus, better than anything the March-On-Washington Committee might have said or done, the true significance of the March is being revealed in the frantic efforts of the Roosevelt administration to stifle it.
 




The President’s Memorandum
President Roosevelt’s memorandum on the question of Negro exclusion from the war industries deserves more study than has been given it. For it must be remembered that this is the first time in the almost nine years that he has been in the White House that Roosevelt has ever spoken an the question of the Negroes’ problems at all.
Everyone with any political understanding at all knows why Roosevelt made the statement at this time. It was intended to get the leaders of the. March-On-Washington Committee to call off the July 1 demonstration in the capitol.
First of all, it should be repeated that Roosevelt did not do anything to end industrial Jim Crowism. In his statement, he only approved the action of the Office of Production Management in sending a letter to all employers two months ago, asking them to “examine whether or not” their employment policies “make ample provision for the full utilization of available and competent Negro workers.” Everyone knows that nothing has happened since that time. Employers may have examined their policies, or they may not; but certainly Negroes have not gotten jobs as a result.
 

Negro Press Swallows It
We make this point again because there has been so much confusion cast on the question by the major Negro newspapers. The Afro-American, for example, said: “President Orders Defense Jobs Open to All.” The Chicago Defender: “FDR Breaks Silence; Urges OPM to Smash Defense Job Race Ban; President, Stirred by Many Protests of Negroes, Takes Belated Action to End Employment Injustice.” The Pittsburgh Courier: “‘JOBS FOR ALL’ – ROOSEVELT; Nation’s Chief Executive Orders OPM to Halt Discrimination in All U.S. Defense Industries.” As though to clinch the matter, the Courier head on the continuation of the story says: “Roosevelt Ends Industrial Bias.”
The plain and simple fact, of course, is that none of these headlines are correct. They are only another example of that gullibility that characterizes the Negro press when it comes to half-hearted promises and evasive statements thrown to them as crumbs.
The editor of The Militant correctly wrote last week that Roosevelt did not even speak out, let alone act, against the whole system of discrimination in industry. “With careful intent, Roosevelt’s words are: ‘in defense industries’, ‘in this present emergency’, ‘in defense production’.” Roosevelt presents the question of job Jim Crow in a “reasonable” manner, and summed up he means this:
“There is going to be a labor shortage, and employers will have to use Negroes in the end anyhow. Besides, this is an emergency, and we must make sacrifices, even to the extent of hiring some Negroes. This will not hurt the system of Jim Crowism, because it will last only for the emergency, and because in order to defend our Jim Crow democracy, we must use all the forces at our disposal. In addition, giving the Negroes a few jobs will serve to remove from us the stigma of preaching one thing for Europe and practicing the opposite here. I am not taking any steps to force employers to hire Negroes, I am only showing them how reasonable it would be.”
 

Roosevelt’s “Moral Authority”
Nobody who reads his memorandum carefully can claim that Roosevelt does more than add his moral authority to the OPM’s request to relax a little the Jim Crow bars.
Whenever most employers are approached by Negro and labor organizations with the demand that they hire Negroes, they reply that they themselves have no objection to hiring them, but that their white employees do, and there would be “trouble” which might result in a reduction in production.
This is the bosses’ line. But what does the government, what does Roosevelt say?
In their treatment of the Negroes in that government department where the greatest number of Negroes are utilized, the armed forces, Roosevelt says the very same thing as the bosses! In the army and the navy, Negroes are segregated. In the army Negroes are all in separate regiments, there is no such thing as a mixed regiment where Negro and white soldiers march or work side by side. In the navy Negroes are permitted only in the mess department, and nowhere else. The continued maintenance of this Jim Crow system has been explained by Roosevelt and his Secretary of the Navy on the basis that “to make changes would produce situations destructive to morale and detrimental to the preparations for national defense.”
One can easily see from this how much Roosevelt’s moral authority on the question of Jim Crowism amounts to!
One can also judge Roosevelt’s memorandum as much by what it leaves out as by what it says. Roosevelt has many times been asked to put some teeth into the OPM’s letter. He could tell the War and Navy Departments to stop all government contracts to employers who discriminate in their employment policies. The result would be the immediate hiring of Negro workers by thousands of plants. These plants are run for one reason only: for private profit. If the government were in any way to threaten that private profit, the employers would drop their employment bars like pieces of hot iron.
But Roosevelt makes no such step. He is ready to send troops in to break strikes, but he isn’t willing to even threaten employers who refuse to hire Negroes.
The refrain may become monotonous, but it is none the less true: The bosses don’t “give” anything for nothing. Workers, Negro and white, win things that are worthwhile only by fighting for them.
 



The July 1 March on Washington to demand the abolition of discrimination against the Negro people in employment and, the armed forces is a project worthy of the support of every Negro and white worker. It is worthy of support in spite of the fact that its organizers (A. Philip Randolph and his friends) have not done too well a job of arousing and mobilizing the Negro masses behind it, and in spite of the fact that its demands are not formulated very well.
The March is worthy of support because essentially it is an ACTION against the system of Jim Crowism that segregates and discriminates against Negroes wherever they go.
The Negro masses themselves have had no difficulty in seeing this. Everywhere, the local March-on-Washington Committees, report the workers, whenever they have been reached, have dug into their pockets and donated and volunteered for the march – and the questions they have asked have not been: “Should we support the March?” but “How can we make this March more successful?”
 
Courier Opposes March
But while the Negro masses have grasped the need for the March immediately, some sections of the Negro intellectuals have been unable to do the same. A typical example is the editorial writer of the Pittsburgh Courier this week, who says:
“Nothing is going to be accomplished by the crackpot proposal of A. Philip Randolph and his associates to stage a march on Washington in protest against color discrimination in national defense.
“Marches on Washington have always failed of their purpose because Congress has regarded them merely as nuisances organized by publicity hounds, job-hunters and addle-pates, and consisting of the mob-minded and misguided ...”
 
The Courier’s Alibi
In order to justify this language, which is an exact language that will be used by the Negro-hating poll tax Democratic legislators in Washington on July 1, the Courier editorial writer continues:
“Led by the Pittsburgh Courier, which has spent thousands of dollars during, the past four years in enlightening public opinion about color discrimination in national defense, colored people have so flooded their Congressmen, Senators and the President with protests that not a single official in Washington is unaware of the evil.
“Can a parade tell them anything they do not already know?
“Randolph’s group is loudly claiming that they will have between 50,000 and 100,000 Negroes parading in Washington on July 1, 1941.
“This will be a great boon to the railroad companies and to the oil and gas stations in Washington and vicinity, but it will certainly be a hardship on the marchers.
“The most effective way of influencing Congress and the Administration is by personal letters and telegrams from individuals, societies, church congregations, clubs and fraternities; by memorials and resolutions sent to both Houses and by intelligent personal representations.”
And the rest of the editorial is devoted to the fact that even 1,000 Negroes would swamp the eating and housing facilities in Washington, and to the prophecy that because of the heat and other difficulties, “there will be far less than the heralded 50,000 Negroes present on that date.”
 
Answering the Courier
A parade will not tell the Washington Administration anything they do not already know about the evil effects of Jim Crowism on the Negro people. If all the parade were intended for was to make the Congressmen “aware of the evil,” it would indeed be a waste of time. But this line of argument, as the Courier editors know well enough, doesn’t really touch the point of the March.
A successful and gigantic demonstration in Washington that presented a militant set of demands on the administration, a demonstration that showed that the Negro people are ready to do more than send telegrams, that showed they are ready to fight Jim Crow – that would certainly tell Washington something it doesn’t already know!
The Courier editorial writer describes “the most effective way of influencing Congress, and the Administration.” What has come of this, “most effective way”?
What good have all the resolutions, letters, telegrams, memorials and “intelligent personal representations” done so far? Has it gotten any jobs in the war industries? Has it diminished by one inch the segregation in the armed forces? If that is really “the most effective way,” then there isn’t much hope.
 
The Masses Know Better
But the masses know that isn’t the most effective way at all. They know from their own daily experiences that you don’t get anything unless you’re ready to put up a fight for it, that you don’t get higher wages by writing a letter hut by organizing your fellow-workers and putting up a united, militant struggle, against your exploiters. Those who exaggerate the difficulties of a fight usually are not around when it takes place.
And this Courier editorial writer certainly has a nerve saying: that the march “will be a great boon to the railroad companies and to the oil and gas stations.” Using this kind of logic, one could; easily condemn the Courier and its methods of fighting Jim Crow as a great boon to the telegraph companies, the post office and the ink manufacturers.
 
Where We Stand
The Socialist Workers Party rejects the defeatist, non-struggle policies of the Courier’s editorial writer, and calls on all workers to join and to build the March on Washington into a powerful manifestation of the Negroes’ intention in fight to the death against all forms of Jim Crow.
* * *
The same day that the Courier broke its silence: on the March to come out against it, the Daily Worker and the Communist Party broke their silence to come out in critical support of the March.
 
Why Stalinists Changed
The long silence of the Stalinists on the question indicated that they would have been glad to duck it altogether. That this was so was shown by the hands-off attitude of the local Stalinists wherever the March was being organized.
However, their failure to find a reason to justify non-support of the march, and the pressure they must have felt from those Negro workers with whom they are in contact, must have driven them at the last moment to a declaration of qualified support. Just what else they will do besides this remains yet to be seen.
 




The Negro March On Washington
Last week, in our discussion of the proposed march of 10,000 Negroes on Washington on July 1, we indicated our support of the undertaking and called attention to the fact that the most important consideration in the march had to be the demands made by the marchers when they got there.
We discussed the proposal of the Negro Committee handling the march preparations; it intends to ask a presidential decree abolishing discrimination in employment and the armed forces. We explained how this was based on A. Philip, Randolph’s theory that Roosevelt could issue such an order tomorrow, “and discriminations against colored people would promptly end.”
We support the demand, that Roosevelt should issue an executive order against discrimination. But we definitely do not believe that discrimination would end if Roosevelt issued the order. We support this demand because it would help the fight against specific cases of Jim Crowism, but do not believe it would by itself abolish Jim Crowism.
In support of our position, we want to recall one of the statements made by A. Philip Randolph in the article in which he first called for the march. It should be remembered that this, statement of his was advanced as a reason for holding the march. Printed in January, it said:
“It seems to be apparent that even when well-meaning, responsible, top government officials agree upon a fair and favorable policy, there are loopholes, and subordinate officers in the Army, Navy and Air Corps, full of race hatred, who seek its contravention, nullification and evasion.”
To this he should have added that the Negro-hating, labor-hating employers in industry know very well how to avoid laws and rulings when it serves their purpose.
How does Randolph square this statement of his in January with the one he made in April that a presidential decree would “promptly” end discrimination?
 

What Randolph Leaves Out
He doesn’t, and he doesn’t try to. He ignores this question, as he does others which touch the very heart of the problem, such as:
Industry, lock, stock and barrel, is in the hands of an employer class which fosters and strengthens anti-Negro prejudices in order to be able to more easily exploit workers of all races.
Military training, lock, stock and barrel, is in the hands of a hardened anti-Negro bureaucratic military caste which is dedicated to the maintenance in military life of every form of racial discrimination that exists in civilian life.
The government, lock, stock and barrel, is in the hands of a war-mongering administration that is notorious for its indifference to the needs and desires of the Negro people, and of two capitalist parties which take turns when they are in power in kicking around legislation such as the anti-lynch bill and the poll tax bill.
In other words, far more important than the question of an executive order which would only echo other rulings already on the books, is the question of CONTROL.
Even if the order were issued by Roosevelt, it would remain on paper, as long as control of industry, military training and the government remain in the hands of the enemies of the Negroes.
 

A Program for Militant Negroes
Consequently, Negroes must ask for more than a presidential order.
Employers controlling the war industries won’t hire Negroes? Then expropriate the war industries, have the government take them over, and let them be managed and operated without discrimination by committees elected by the workers!
Negroes need military training in this period when all major questions are decided arms in hand, but the army bureaucrats are bitterly anti-Negro and determined to “keep them in their place”? Then join the fight for military training, financed by the government but Under control of the trade Unions, based on full equality for the Negroes!
The government and the boss parties aid the bosses in segregating and discriminating against the Negro people, refusing to pass such elementary legislation as the anti-lynch and poll tax bills ? Then aid in the formation of a labor party pledged to carry on the Negroes’ struggle, pledged to establish a Workers’ and Farmers’ government that, would create a hew society that would forever abolish poverty, war and racial discrimination!
This is the kind of program that Negroes need and must fight for – in Washington on July 1 and everywhere else until they win full social, economic and political freedom.
We do not pretend that the mere adoption of these demands by the marchers will bring automatic victory. Jim Crowism is too strongly rooted in the ways and customs and traditions of our great American democracy to be torn out easily. It will require a long and bitter fight, that will not be ended on July 1.
But with this program the marchers, and the Negro people, will have a Weapon that will make a good start on July 1 and lay the foundation for a struggle that will end in victory, instead of in defeat and demoralization, as happens to so many actions that have no clear goal.
 




How To Defend the Soviet Union
Last week we explained that workers, Negro and white, have the job of defending the Soviet Union against its imperialist enemies, in spite of Stalin’s crimes against the world working class because the Soviet Union is a workers’ state and because its defeat by the imperialists would greatly strengthen the bosses in their exploitation and oppression of the workers everywhere. This week we want to discuss how workers, and especially Negro workers, can best defend the Soviet Union.
By defense of the Soviet Union, it must be understood, first of all we Trotskyists do not mean the same thing at all that the Stalinists do. They don’t defend the same things we do, and they don’t defend them in the same way.
What they defend in the Soviet Union first of all is Stalinism, the power and privileges and theories of the corrupt bureaucracy that has seized control of the state. What WE defend is the remains of the greatest revolution of all time, the nationalized property relations, the economic foundation which if extended will lead to socialism and a new kind of society.
For example, a month ago, the Stalinists, feeling that the United States when it entered the war would probably be in an alliance directed against the Soviet Union, spent all their time denouncing the war preparations of the U.S. government and trying to keep it from entering the war with full military steps. As part of its propaganda, the Communist Party dealt with the Negro question and Jim Crowism, showed how false are Roosevelt’s slogans about “a war for democracy”.
Then came the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. And now the policy of the Stalinists in this country is not to “get out and stay out of the war,” but to get into it as quickly as possible. As a result, almost every single correct argument the Stalinists used a month ago has today been thrown overboard. The Daily Worker no longer stresses the contradictions between a war for democracy abroad and Jim Crowism at home. It no longer criticizes Roosevelt except because he is so slow at getting into the war. It calls on the Negro people not to oppose the war, but to put pressure on Roosevelt to hasten American entry.
In short, in order to get an alliance between Stalin and Roosevelt, the Stalinists are ready to drop everything else, including the struggle against Jim Crowism.
 

The Stalinists and the Negro March
A concrete example of the change in their approach to the Negro problem is the recently called-off Negro March On Washington. Before the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Stalinists bitterly criticized the leaders of the March because they were tied to Roosevelt’s war machine, because their demands were inadequate, because they did not demand that the government support the anti-lynch and anti-poll tax bills, because they did not demand that the government stay out of war, etc. When the Roosevelt, administration began to put pressure on Randolph and White and the other leaders of the March, in an attempt to get it called off, the Daily Worker warned the Negroes to be careful that they did not submit to the pressure and call off the march.
Then came the invasion and a few days later Randolph gave in to Roosevelt, and in return for a face saving executive order which granted very little, called off the March. If this had happened a week earlier, the Stalinists would have raised holy hell, attacking and condemning Randolph. But since the Stalinists now had a new line, they uttered not a single word of criticism that the March had been called off. True, they saw what they called a few “loopholes” in Roosevelt’s executive order, but their National Negro Congress called it “a great step forward.”
We want to warn Negroes who watch the developments of the Stalinist line hot to expect a complete and open reversal overnight. If they did this, they would quickly lose all the influence among the militant Negroes which they now have. They will not drop their demand for the passage of an anti-lynch bill, for instance. After all, many “liberals” who also support the imperialist war, still think it would be good to pass such a bill. But the Stalinists will no longer make much of a point of it, and certainly will support Roosevelt’s war plans despite his refusal to back the anti-lynch bill.
 

We Fight On Against Jim Crow
As opposed to the Stalinist line, the Socialist Workers Party finds no contradiction between revolutionary defense of the Soviet Union and continuation of militant struggle for labor and Negro rights.
As the Manifesto of the Socialist Workers Party says:
“The method to defend the Soviet Union is to continue the class struggle against the imperialists. Defend workers’ rights against government strikebreaking! Build the power of the working class until it becomes the governmental power. That is the best service which the American workers can render to their brothers in the Soviet Union.”
In other words, class conscious Negroes must continue their struggle against Jim Crowism. Together with their white brothers, they must help to substitute for the present system of exploitation and discrimination, a system of socialist brotherhood which will help to solve our problems here and to defend the Soviet Union at the same time.
 



A. Philip Randolph – and a few others consider Roosevelt’s executive order on Negroes and the war industries a “second Emancipation Proclamation.” But apparently Roosevelt doesn’t. He didn’t speak about it over the radio; you won’t see him reading the order in the newsreels; he didn’t even hold a press conference on the matter, as he does on almost everything else, small or big.
The capitalist press gave the order practically no publicity. (It would be interesting to find out how many newspapers south of the Mason-Dixon line even mentioned it).
Randolph had to speak about the order over the radio since Roosevelt wouldn’t. Hillman had to hold the press conference. Negroes had to wait for the Negro press to explain what the order was about, and those papers didn’t do a very good job at it either.
All this indicates very clearly how important Roosevelt considers this so-called “second Emancipation Proclamation.”
* * *
Negro Youth Blast Randolph’s Retreat
Randolph had no trouble in getting his hand-picked national committee in charge of the March to approve its “postponement, but not cancellation.” But the national youth committee, which was not hand-picked, but was made up largely of delegates of different youth organizations, had a different attitude, and one which really represented the feelings of 95 per cent of the rank-and-file supporters of the March.
At a meeting called to consider Randolph’s report on why the March was being called off, the youth committee “voted 44 to 1 to repudiate the action of the national executive committee and to demand that the march be staged within 90 days.” (Pittsburgh Courier)
* * *
The Chicago Defender tells of a typical rank-and-file supporter of the March:
“In Florida, a 77-year-old woman sold a member of the Office of Production Management staff a ‘jobless march button’ and swore that she was going to take part in the parade. She had money enough to carry her only as far as Savannah, Ga., which is about six or 700 miles short of her goal, but she was determined to get the rest of the distance and vowed she would make it if she had to walk.”
What a far cry this is from the attitude of some of the leaders of the March, who had only to get into a Pullman train or a plane, and who were just as determined to see that the March did not go through!
* * *
Horace R. Cayton, labor editor of the Pittsburgh Courier, one of the speakers at the NAACP conference in Houston, describes a stirring speech by Robert Ming on the Negroes and the armed forces, and then says:
“In one very real sense it was a pity that they did not stop the meeting then, for A. Philip Randolph followed Ming. Randolph made an apologetic statement which finally led up to the fact that ‘they’ (I don’t know who ‘they’ were) had called off the march to Washington. His arguments concerning the reason for calling off the march, as I understood it, was because the President had issued an executive order setting up a board for the purpose of integrating Negroes into the defense program ...
“It sounded pretty thin when he stated it in the Good Hope Baptist Church; it sounds even worse when I write it today. Randolph has a lot of explaining to do, and so have all the rest mixed up in the direction of the March – and he didn’t do it down here. Walter White, in the last mass meeting on Friday night, expressed his own dissatisfaction with the President’s order and pointed out its weaknesses. He also, however, justified the calling off of the march.”
* * *
How Roosevelt’s Order Looks in Practice
The New Jersey Herald News states that Roosevelt order “will have little or no effect in New Jersey.” This seems certain if the conference between the Urban League and Glenn Gardiner, state director of defense training for OPM, means anything. It must be remembered that the first of the three points of the order provides that all governmental agencies “concerned with vocational and training programs for defense production shall take special measures appropriate to assure that such programs are administered without discrimination.”
“This is a very deep-rooted sociological problem ... I am not very hopeful that it can be solved ‘just like that’,” said OPM spokesman Gardiner. “I can’t see that the President’s order will have any particular effect on our program. Our function is helping companies in their training of employees. It’s not for us to say who shall be hired.
“Naturally,” he went on, “whenever our opinion is asked, it is our duty to encourage employment with no discrimination, but it’s not up to us to take the initiative.
“The problem may solve itself when there’s a shortage of unskilled help, as well as skilled. It’s a tough problem, and the reason it’s tough is that everyone pussyfoots on it. I’m afraid attempts to pressure the thing in the emergency may not work out.”
And this is a statement from an OPM official AFTER the issuance of the so-called “second Emancipation Proclamation”! Far better than Randolph’s speeches, it indicates what the government is really going to do about Jim Crow in industry – nothing.
 




Defend Our Party Against Roosevelt
The Socialist Workers Party is under attack from the war-monger Roosevelt and his Gestapo-FBI because of our opposition to the war.
In the indictments against the 29 defendants handed down by the St. Paul Grand Jury last week, it was charged that they were trying to get “members of the military and naval forces of the United States to become undisciplined, to complain about food, living conditions and missions to which they would be assigned, to create dissension, dissatisfaction and insubordination among the armed forces ...”
In other words, the government is trying to find a scapegoat to blame for the fact that black and white workers are dissatisfied with the present anti-labor, Jim Crow regime in the army and navy.
But every Negro who is at all acquainted with the way Negro soldiers and sailors are segregated and discriminated against in the armed forces will quickly understand what the government is up to. This attack on the Socialist Workers Party, which has consistently fought for the rights of all workers, is also an attack, on the right of the workers, to seek equal and just treatment in the armed forces. For if the Socialist Workers Party can be indicted and suppressed because the party fights for an end to Jim Crowism in the armed forces, so can everyone else.
That is why Negro workers must rally to defense of the 29 defendants.
 

Why Negroes Dislike the Army
But aside from this, every Negro worker must be thinking to himself:
“How ridiculous is this business of seeking a scapegoat for dissatisfaction with the way we are treated in this army! Roosevelt knows very well who is responsible for our being dissatisfied – it is Roosevelt himself, and his Jim Crow cabinet who are responsible. The conditions to which we object were not created by the Socialist Workers Party – they are upheld and maintained – by the government itself.”
The Socialist Workers Party is not responsible for Roosevelt’s orders that Negro and white soldiers must be segregated and kept completely separate in all phases of army life.
The Socialist Workers Party is not responsible for ecretary of the Navy Knox’s order that Negroes can serve only as mess stewards and dish-washers on board the ships of the U.S. Navy.
Roosevelt justifies his Jim Crow position on the grounds that to maintain mixed regiments of both colored and white soldiers “would be destructive to morale and detrimental to the prep’arations for national defense.” Knox says that to let Negroes serve in the Navy on the same basis as, white sailors would be “a dangerous experiment.”
What they mean is that, if they even pretended to grant equality to the Negroes in the armed forces, the poll-tax South might not support Roosevelt’s war plans so eagerly. They are really afraid that the end of Jim Crow in the armed forces would be “destructive” to white supremacy, “detrimental” to the continued existence of Jim Crow in civilian life, and “a dangerous experiment” to the capitalists who profit by keeping white and Negro workers divided.
But by following a policy of appeasing Jim Crow, Roosevelt and his gang have only exposed to the Negroes the hypocrisy of their slogans about fighting for democracy.
And now that the Negro people are dissatisfied and complaining, Roosevelt seeks to attribute the cause of this to “agitators” who are trying to “overthrow the government.”
 

How to Satisfy the Worker-Soldier
There is a way for Roosevelt to get rid of this dissatisfaction in the armed forces.
First of all, let him wipe out discrimination and segregation of all kinds. Then let him permit the soldiers to have the right to choose their own officers, the kind of men they can trust to look out for their welfare. Then let them have the right to elect committees from their own ranks, who will represent them when they have any grievances. Then let Roosevelt tell them why the armed forces are being built up and what he intends to use them for; let him try to prove that it is really a war against fascism that he wants to fight and not another war for bosses’ profits, by clearly announcing his war aims and by preventing war profiteering in all spheres.
If he would do this, dissatisfaction would disappear. But he cannot do this because he is interested above everything else in protecting boss profits and the system that goes with it.
We know that he cannot do it, and that is why we have raised our own program and demands: Let us have military training, financed by the government, but under the control of the trade unions which the workers can trust and through which they will be able to correct their grievances.
Under such a system, maybe the warmongers and the profiteers and the lynch mobs would be dissatisfied. But not the workers!
Roosevelt may attempt to suppress the activities of the Socialist Workers Party because of its consistent opposition to his war plans and its demand for military training under the trade unions – but that will hot remove the smallest part of the dissatisfaction that now exists, any more than it will prevent our continued struggle against war, fascism, Jim Crowism and unemployment.
 



The key charges in the indictments handed down against the Socialist Workers Party last week revolve around our party’s anti-war stand and the concretization of our anti-war stand in our proletarian military policy.
It would not serve the purpose of Roosevelt’s Department of Justice to present our real military policy, as it was actually adopted at our national conference last September and as it has been presented, countless times in our press, in our public meetings and in the election platforms of our candidates for office.
For the truth would completely discredit and disprove the Roosevelt Administration’s charges.
An examination of these charges in the indictment, numbered 7, 8 and 9, – supposed to describe our military policy – clearly demonstrates the purpose of the prosecutions. Because what they accuse us of is not the policy we really advocate, but a falsified and distorted version, cooked up for the purposes of a frameup.
Number 7 of the indictment charges that:
“The defendants and their co-conspirators would endeavor by any means at their disposal to procure members of the military and naval forces of the United States to become undisciplined, to complain about food, living conditions, and missions to which they would be assigned, to create dissension, dissatisfaction and insubordination among the armed forces, to impair the loyalty and morale thereof, and FINALLY TO SEEK TO GAIN CONTROL OF SAID NAVAL AND MILITARY FORCES so that the enlisted personnel thereof would revolt against its officers, thereby enabling said defendants to overcome and put down by force and arms the constitutional government of the United States.”
Paragraph 9 makes substantially the same charge.
Our military policy has nothing in common with the police-mind version fabricated by the Department of Justice. Here is what we advocate:
We recognize in this period of universal militarism and the deadly advances of fascism, the need for military training of the workers. We never succumbed for a minute to the fatal ideas of pacifism. On the contrary we pointed out that workers could overcome fascism only by fighting it, and that pacifism would only disarm the workers.
But the experiences of both the first and second World Wars have taught us that the best interests of the workers cannot be entrusted to the bosses or their agents on the military field any more than in the factories. The downfall of France, we have pointed out, contained a great lesson for American workers. There the government had built a great army in the name of a war against fascism. But instead of carrying this war through, the army bureaucrats capitulated and delivered the French workers to Hitler.
The way the U.S. Army is constituted, we said, offers us no assurances that the same thing that happened in France will not happen here.
 
The Anti-Labor Military Hierarchy
The army is run by a hardened bureaucratic caste that is distinguished, as a result of its background, training and traditions, by the following characteristics:

It is anti-labor and anti-democratic.
 
It is composed almost exclusively of men drawn from that part ot society that is most alien to and separated from the needs and interests of the working class.
 
It bases itself on a harsh barracks discipline that tends to destroy the independent thought and initiative of the worker-soldiers.
 
It is conservative in its military thinking and strategy.

No informed person would dispute these characterizations. As a matter of fact, they are openly admitted by many “liberal” supporters of Roosevelt’s war, and program, and even by some of the more observant sections of the army bureaucracy itself, who are trying to effect some reforms in order to make the army regime more satisfactory for their own purposes and more acceptable in the eyes of the masses.
There is no question, either, but that the workers look with suspicion and distrust on this military caste. Nor is there any question about the existence of a wide spread dissatisfaction with it among American workers. The war mongers may attempt through this frameup of the Socialist Workers Party to attribute this dissatisfaction to our activities. But everyone knows that we are not responsible for these conditions. We did not “create” them we only discuss them. They were created by Roosevelt and his class.
 
Our Program for Militant Training
We told the workers: If we are forced to depend on such a set-up what may result, in spite of all the workers’ sacrifices, is the definitive victory of fascism and the establishment of an American Vichy regime by the very forces that today tell us there is no other way to fight fascism than by joining the army and supporting the Roosevelt war program and everything that goes with it But there is another way. It is briefly expressed in the slogan raised by our party:
“Military training of workers, financed by the government, but under control of the trade unions. Special officers’ training camps, financed by the government but controlled by the trade unions, to train workers to become officers.”
Our program of military training under trade union control is to be achieved, not by gaining control of the existing governmental armed forces, but as a result of independent pressure on the government for appropriations to be used to train the workers and to train worker-officers in special camps, to be set up for this express purpose and to be operated by the trade unions.
We recognize very well that only a disciplined armed force can successfully fight off fascist attacks. But lack of discipline does not arise from “agitation” or “propaganda”. It arises, in the armed forces as in industry and everywhere else, only as a result of rotten conditions and the lack of machinery for correcting them. It is precisely the fact that the nature of the present military regime prohibits correction that ends weight to our argument for the establishment of a system of military training, which by its nature will be democratically operated, will permit the handling and satisfaction of legitimate grievances, and will thus automatically build and create the kind of discipline which no fascist army, itself chock full of barracks discipline and dissatisfaction, could possibly withstand.
 
What We Do When We Are Conscripted
Paragraph 8 of the indictments charges that:
“When the Selective Service Act was passed, the members of said Socialist Workers Party would be urged to willingly accept service, but after being inducted into the army of the United States, to do everything in their power to disrupt, hinder, and impair the efficient functioning thereof, and when the appropriate time came to turn their weapons against their officers.”
The indictment does not err in stating that we advised class-conscious workers not to seek an individual solution of their problem by refusing to go when drafted. But it falsifies from beginning to end what we advise workers to do after they were drafted.
One quotation from many in the record will prove this. In our official Resolution on Proletarian Military Policy, we said:
“Under conditions of mass militarization the revolutionary worker cannot evade military exploitation any more than he can evade exploitation in the factory. He does not seek a personal solution of the problem of war by evading military service. That is nothing but a desertion of class duty. The proletarian revolutionist goes with the masses. He becomes a soldier when they become soldiers, and goes to war when they go to war. The proletarian revolutionist strives to become the most skilled among the worker-soldiers, and demonstrates in action that he is most concerned for the general welfare and protection of his comrades. Only in this way, as in the factory, can the proletarian revolutionist gain the confidence of his comrades in arms and become an influential leader among them.”
Obviously, far from urging the class conscious worker to follow a policy of “disrupting, hindering and impairing” – a policy which could only place his fellow soldiers as well as himself in the greatest danger, especially in time of combat – we urged him to become “the most skilled” among the soldiers.
We tell the workers to learn the military arts because they have to learn them if they do not want to be crushed by fascism, of either the foreign or domestic variety.
We tell them to demand training under trusted leadership so that not only will they be able to defeat foreign fascism, but also to prevent an American capitulation and the establishment of fascism from within. In other words, we are serious about this business of fighting fascism.
Thus, we see, the government is preparing to suppress us on charges that we are trying to impede and interfere with a war against fascism, when actually it is preparing to suppress the only party with a program that will really guarantee the defeat of fascism of all kinds!
 




The Courier and the Negro March
Without any question the biggest news of the first week of the month, so far as the struggle for Negro rights is concerned, was the bureaucratic cancellation of the March on Washington at the time that the eyes and hopes of all advanced Negro workers were turned in the direction of the scheduled March.
And still the Pittsburgh Courier found room on its front page for only a couple of inches of reading matter on the March. And its lead – and it really splashed and splurged on it – was a long denunciation of Walter White and the N.A.A.C.P. for being responsible for the postponement of a hearing to be held by a Senate Committee on discrimination against Negroes in the war industries.
The Courier’s handling of these questions was neither accidental nor the result of slovenly journalism. Rather, it was a brazen attempt on the part of the editors to cover up the shabby role they had played against the March. By attracting attention to a secondary matter of extremely little importance, they hoped we’d forget how they behaved about the March. It was an attempt by a paper with a “militant” reputation to hide its own bankruptcy. Negroes must understand this if they are to avoid mistakes in the future. They must understand not only Randolph’s treachery in calling off the March, but also the treachery of the only paper which had dared to oppose the March.
The reason that the Courier did not attack Randolph was that in calling off the March Randolph had only done what the Courier had urged and advised from the beginning. The Courier therefore could not expose Randolph’s miserable policies without at the same time exposing its own.
 

The Courier’s Substitute for the March
The Courier had opposed “the crack-pot proposal,” as it called the March, because “Led by the Pittsburgh Courier ... colored people have so flooded their Congressmen, Senators and the President with protests that not a single official in Washington is unaware of the evil. Can a parade tell them anything they do not already know?” It had its own methods for defeating Jim Crowism, claimed the Courier. “The most effective way of influencing Congress and the Administration is by personal letters and telegrams from individuals, societies, church congregations, clubs and fraternities; by memorials and resolutions sent to both Houses, and by intelligent personal representations.”
The few weeks before the scheduled date of the March blew all this sky high.
The mere threat of a March did more than the thousands of telegrams, letters, postcards, memorials, resolutions, phone-calls, intelligent personal representations, wishful thinking, prayer and even the “political pressure” on Roosevelt practiced last year when the Courier supported Willkie.
For the first time Roosevelt began to show some interest in the question. Of course that interest was not based on a desire to do anything concrete and fundamental about Jim Crowism. It took the threat of the March to get him to admit that there was a problem. He did not do more than pay lip-service to it, and he was helped in getting away with this by the willingness of the leaders of the March to avoid him any embarrassment. Even so, still far more was accomplished by the March threat than by the Courier’s “most effective way.”
Now let us consider the subterfuge resorted to by the Courier to cover up its tracks.
The NAACP, the Courier, and many other Negro groups have for some time been demanding a Congressional investigation of discrimination. Congress avoided adoption of Resolution 75 setting up a special committee for the purpose and instead turned the matter over to the Truman Committee, which was busy investigating other matters and which would have little time for study of Negro discrimination. Truman announced that it would be a long time before his committee would even get around to the matter.
But suddenly, as part of Roosevelt’s moves to call off the March, the Truman Committee announced that it would open a three-day session on the matter on June 30, the day before the March was to take place. The purpose for this hurried move was undoubtedly correctly explained by the NAACP, namely, so that when the March took place, it could be said, “What are you Negroes kicking about? We are holding hearings right now!”
The NAACP then asked for a postponement of 30 days, citing many reasons, some correct, some very weak. Immediately a number of other big shot Negroes, like the publicity-loving demagogue Edgar Brown, who were very eager to get their names in the paper, by one way or another, got very excited at this “betrayal.”
The Courier felt that it had an issue and it blew the balloon as big as it could. Let us show how easy it is to prick it.
Let us remind the Courier:
“Led by The Pittsburgh Courier ... colored people have so flooded their Congressmen, Senators and the President with protests that not a single official in Washington is unaware of the evil. Can a parade tell them anything they do not already know?”
If a parade cannot tell them anything they do not already know, what can another futile, three day Senate committee gab fest tell them? No, the Courier cannot escape the consequences of its vacillating policies. It cannot conceal the fact that for its own selfish, craven reasons it gave aid and comfort to Jim Crow at a time that the Negro masses were preparing to strike it a powerful blow.
 



Since the Negro March on Washington was called off, the government has done nothing to implement Roosevelt’s executive order which was supposed to do so much to end racial discrimination in the war industries. Yet most of the Negro “leaders” and papers have continued to shout themselves hoarse about the great significance of that executive order.
The reaction of neither the government nor the Negro leaders is half so significant, however, as the reaction of the big business men and industrialists who have up until now continued to refuse Negroes employment in their factories.
Sam Lacy in the Afro-American last week reported on a hearing on housing problems held in Baltimore after the issuance of Roosevelt’s order, in the course of which Glenn L. Martin, president of the big aircraft corporation bearing his name, was asked some very direct questions regarding the problem of employing Negroes, something his company has refused to do up to the present time.
For some reason Congressman Osmers of New Jersey, who was conducting the question, sought to get a statement from Martin with regard to the effects of the president’s order.
Osmers began by asking Martin, to his great embarrassment, what the employment policy of his company was, whether it used Negro labor. Martin replied that it did not, and when asked why, explained as follows:
“Because we have not been able to find a sufficient number of colored men skilled or being trained in the work in which they might be used. And because wherever vocational courses are being conducted in Baltimore there are not enough colored persons taking the courses to justify our consideration of them as likely prospects.”
(Lacy points out that the Martin plant has several thousand people taking training courses on the grounds and that the company refuses to admit Negroes to these courses as well as employment).
Osmers asked Martin if lack of trained colored men was the only reason, and Martin replied: “Well, there are some other factors perhaps. I, personally, have nothing against the colored race, but if I hired them I would be forced to segregate them.”
Pressed for an explanation of this, he said:
“Because I’d be compelled to do so by policy. It is the policy of the State of Maryland to segregate colored people. They go to different theaters, different churches and different schools. They’re segregated all over the State, therefore, I’d have no alternative.”
But is was obvious that there was a real contradiction at this point. Even if Maryland practiced Jim Crowism, President Roosevelt had just issued an order which said there was to be no further discrimination in employment. Martin was trying to justify his vicious policies by pretending that he was only abiding by the laws of the state. But how could he justify that if the federal government had ordered that discrimination must be stopped? Was he “law-abiding” only so far as the state went? Could he justify disregard of a federal order by reiterating his desire to abide by the state’s laws?
Alibi No. 2.
Blames the Workers
Osmers then rushed to Martin’s aid with a “leading question”: “Is it a fact that should you place colored help in your plant you will face an immediate stoppage of work?”
Martin pounced on that excuse. “There would be an immediate stoppage of work. We know that. It couldn’t be avoided.”
Here we see the pretext that will be used by Martin and all the other bosses to justify disregard of the president’s order. It is not they who want to keep Negro workers out of work, oh, no, it is the workers who are responsible! And much as the bosses dislike it, they can’t do anything because after all they are concerned only with “producing” for “national defense,” aren’t they?
Negroes must not be deceived by maneuvers of this kind. They must continue their struggle against the bosses, the government and the Uncle Toms until they win full equality.
White workers must see through Martin’s schemes too. By organizing militant unions that accept Negro workers as brothers and fight for their rights too, the white workers can defeat these attempts to fasten the blame for Jim Crowism on themselves, unite the ranks of the working class and go forward to better conditions for all of labor.
 




Negroes and the Soviet Union
Class conscious American Negroes must defend the Soviet Union against its imperialist enemies as part of their own struggle to abolish the system that starves, lynches, disfranchises and Jim Crows them in this country.
We do not pretend that the Soviet Union is an ideal country, where all problems have been solved, where socialism has been reached. Not at all. But it is a Workers’ State, where power has been taken out of the hands of the employers and the landlords, where capitalist bosses no longer run the factories for their own profit, where the foundations for a better life have been laid.
It is true that political power in the Soviet Union is in the hands of a group of bureaucrats who attempt to use that power for themselves, instead of on behalf of the interests of the international working class. Things have changed since the days when Lenin and Trotsky led the Russian workers, and they have not changed for the better. But the Soviet Union is still a Workers’ State, even though it is a weakened and distorted and degenerated one.
And as long as it is a Workers’ State, as long as bosses do not have power there, it must be defended in its struggles against the capitalist world. For it to be defeated would mean an immense strengthening of the world capitalist system. Because then the capitalists would be able through their exploitation of the labor and resources of the Soviet Union to hold onto their power in Europe, the United States and the colonies for many years longer.
On the other hand, if the workers of the world keep the capitalists out of the Soviet Union and thus prevent them from getting the “breathing spell” the capitalists desire, it will be that much easier for the workers and exploited peoples of the world, to make their own revolutions and set up their own Workers and Farmers Governments.
 

Like A Great Trade Union
The Soviet Union is like a large trade union, a workers’ organization, which has fallen under the control of a group of reactionary bureaucrats who are concerned about the welfare/ not of the union, but of themselves. These bureaucrats often make deals with the bosses behind the backs of the workers; they don’t permit the workers to determine the policies of the union; they don’t fight properly to raise wages and better conditions of the rank-and-file; they expel and even beat up militant workers who take the floor to oppose their policies. In such a situation it is the job of advanced workers to seek the support of the majority of the members of the union to replace the conservative leadership of the union with a militant leadership that will restore democracy in the union and lead it in struggles against the bosses. The bosses attack the union, and the bureaucrats, who will have no job if there is no union, are forced in self-defense to declare a strike against the bosses. What should be the attitude of all the members of that union, and of all other unions?
Their attitude must be to defend the union against the bosses, in spite of their sharp differences with the union bureaucrats. The main enemy is the bosses. If the bosses win, there will be no union and there will be no chance for the rank-and-file to improve their union and their conditions. If the bosses win, not only will the bureaucrats be kicked out, but the union, and the whole labor movement, will be weakened.
In the same sense, advanced workers, Negro and white, must call for the defense of the Soviet Union. If the imperialist powers win, they will carve up the Soviet Union in the same way the bosses would break up a union. It would then be a hundred times as hard later on for the advanced workers in the Soviet Union to replace the Stalinist bureaucracy with a revolutionary leadership that would fight for the workers’ interests. It would make much more difficult the job of moving forward in the Soviet Union toward better conditions, toward socialism. We must hot forget the crimes of Stalin, we must get rid of him if we want the struggle to be waged as it should be waged, but we must remember that the main enemy is the imperialist powers who keep the rest of the world in subjection.
 

The Fundamental Principle
We must never forget this principle: wherever a workers’ organization comes into conflict with a capitalist state, wherever a workers’ organization comes into conflict with the bosses, wherever an oppressed people come into conflict with their oppressors, we must support and defend the workers’ state, the workers’ organization, the oppressed people.
It was more or less along the lines of this principle that advanced workers supported and defended the recently called-off Negro March On Washington against its enemies and critics. We did not trust the leaders of the March, the Randolphs and Walter Whites, and we warned the masses that they would not conduct the March in the militant, independent manner required. We pointed out the weaknesses in their program and the bureaucratic way they had organized the March.
But nevertheless we supported the March and called on all workers to do the same. For essentially, in spite of its leadership, the March was a struggle between the Negro people with their labor allies on the one side, and the capitalist government protecting and sponsoring Jim Crowism on the other. If we hadn’t supported the March, or if we had been “neutral” and indifferent, we would only have played into the hands of Jim Crow.
 



The Negro March on Washington, scheduled for July 1, has been called off.
Thousands of Negroes, preparing to leave for the demonstration, with the promises of the official March leaders still ringing in their ears, at the last minute heard A. Philip Randolph, over the radio Saturday night, declare that “the March is unnecessary at this time” and therefore the committee in charge has called it off.
Thus ended a hectic ten day period during which the Roosevelt administration had used every ace it had up its sleeve and which ended in the March being called off only because the Randolph-White leadership was willing to “compromise” and call it off if they were offered something they could use to save face before the thousands who insisted on the March going through until all their demands were granted. Roosevelt finally granted them this face-saving device in his “executive order” of Jurie 25.
Last week The Militant reported that the leaders of the March were being subjected to all kinds of pressure from their “friends” in the administration, but that they were forced to resist it because nothing concrete had been offered them as a bribe to call off the March. Then Randolph and Walter White were called to Washington.
 
Roosevelt’s Line
Here, at a conference attended by many government officials, Roosevelt condescended to give his own views on the March.
He declared that the March was bad and unintelligent. He said that the March would give the impression to the American people that Negroes are seeking to exercise force to compel the government to do certain things and that this attitude would do more harm than good.
(What the Negroes are really trying to get the government to do is to live up to the laws of the United States, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights which are supposed to guard all races against discrimination!)
Although Randolph pointed out that the demands of the marchers were completely just and reasonable, Roosevelt persisted that it was a grave mistake and would not accomplish the object sought, but on the contrary might create serious trouble. He did not state what this serious trouble was, nor who would create it. “What would happen if Irish and Jewish people were to march on Washington?” was the kind of argument he used.
Roosevelt refused to speak to the marchers, claiming that it is his policy not to talk to any groups who come to Washington. White replied that the president had spoken before the American Youth Congress a little over a year ago. Roosevelt became a little confused and said, “And you see what happened, too,” referring to the fact that he had been booed by part of his audience.
 
FDR Defends Jim Crow
When it was pointed out to Roosevelt that Negroes in the Navy are permitted to serve only in the most menial and low-paid capacities, his reply was that the stokers on the ships pefformeci even more menial work than the messmen. He deliberately avoided the point that white men, who serve as stokers, can also serve elsewhere, while Negroes are not permitted to serve anywhere but in the mess department.
Roosevelt then rose to go, saying that he wanted to see discrimination against Negroes eliminated in the war industries, and that he wanted the conference to continue without him. He suggested that perhaps much could be accomplished along these lines if a board were set up which would receive and investigate complaints of discrimination in industry.
 
Sidney Hillman’s Alibi
Sidney Hillman claimed progress was being made by his office in breaking down discrimination. He was then asked if his office would withdraw a contract from a business concern that practiced discrimination. He evaded the question by saying that there are many factors involved and that “national defense has to come first.”
In other words, the preparations for a fake war for democracy abroad are more important to him than the question of democracy at home.
 
Knudsen’s Line
Knudsen stated that he did not think an executive order necessary, that “more can be done through persuasion and education than through force.”
This is the administration’s attitude when it crimes to dealing with the employers, but not when it comes to dealing with the workers, as was shown in the governmental strikebreaking at Inglewood, California.
 
Secretary Knox’s Policy
Then Secretary of the Navy Knox said he wanted to ask Randolph a direct question and that he hoped he would receive an honest reply. “Do you take the position that Negro and white sailors should be compelled to live together on ships?” Randolph replied in the affirmative, and Knox stated lamely that “in time of national defense, experiments of this kind cannot be carried on.” Here better than anything else is an indication of where the administration realty stands on Jim Crowism. For if the head of the Navy believes that it is a dangerous experiment for Negro and white to work together on ships, how can anyone expect the Administration to be sincere iri its efforts to see to it that Negro and white work together in the factories?
A committee headed by LaGuardia was finally set up to make recommendations to Roosevelt, but as the conference ended it was still clear that no gains had been made, and Randolph again issued a statement that the March was still to be held.
The March leaders were under pressure not only from Roosevelt, but also from the masses supporting the March and insisting that it be carried out unless their full demands were granted. These full demands were for
the abolition of discrimination by the employers in industry and by the government in all its departments, including civil service jobs and the armed forces. The form of the demand was that Roosevelt should instruct the OPM, through a presidential proclamation or “executive order,” to withhold contracts from those companies practicing discrimination; and by virtue of his power as president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces to order an end to discrimination in all governmental departments.
 
Randolph Caves In
On the evening of June 25, as the important Harlem March committee was making its final preparations for the March and a demonstration at New York City Hall before that, a telegram arrived from Randolph proclaiming “victory” and ordering the March to be held up.
Instead of securing the agreement of the local committees to calling off the March, Randolph went on the radio Saturday evening.
In his address, entitled A Pledge of Unity, he declared that the March was “unnecessary at this time” and then referred to and quoted an “executive order” issued by Roosevelt on June 25. He explained that the Committee had been intent on going through the March until they got something with “teeth in it.” Now they had the “executive order.”
 
What Randolph Got
In the order Roosevelt says:
“I do hereby reaffirm the policy of the United States that there shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color or national origin, and I do hereby declare that it is the duty of employers and of labbr organizations, in furtherance of said policy and of this order, to provide for the full and equitable participation of all workers in defense industries, without discrimination because of race, creed, color or national origin;
“And it is hereby ordered as follows:

1. “All governmental agencies concerned with vocational and training programs for defense production shall take special measures to assure such programs are administered without discrimination;
2. “All contracting agencies of the Government of the United States shall include in all defense contracts hereafter negotiated by them a provision obligating the contractor not to discriminate against any worker because of race, creed, color, or national origin;
3. “There is established in the Office of Production Management a Committee on Fair Employment Practice” consisting of five members to be appointed by the President. “The Committee shall receive and investigate complaint? of discrimination in violation of the provisions of this order and shall take appropriate steps to redress grievances which it finds to be valid.”

What Negroes Didn’t Get
It does not require great study of this document to understand that while it certainly is an executive order, it is not the executive Order demanded by the Marchers.
The most obvious shortcomings in the document are that it refers only to “defense” industries; it does not say a word about discrimination and segregation in the governmental departments and in the armed forces. Even Randolph had to recognize this in his speech. But Randolph says nothing about the fact that the order refers only to contracts “hereafter negotiated” and thus leaves untouched the 15 billion dollars worth of contracts already negotiated. But even this is not the main point.
The order provides that future contracts must have a provision obligating the contractor not to discriminate. That is all right. But the question is – and this goes to the heart of this particular problem – suppose the contractor gets the contract containing this provision, and continues to practice discrimination? What will happen then?
The answer is: The contract will not be withdrawn. This was what was asked of Roosevelt. The fact that he didn’t include it in his order is proof that contracts won’t be withdrawn.
We have a direct precedent for our answer to this question. When the different departments of the government negotiate contracts nowadays, they include a clause providing that the contractor must live up to federal laws, including the National Labor Relations Act, Walsh-Healy Act, etc. Yet it is a well-known fact that the army one navy have refused to withhold contracts from bosses who consistently violate these laws. The whole labor movement has fought time and again to get the government to withhold or withdraw contracts from such anti-labor employers. The government has the power to do so, according to the laws – but it has always refused to use them.
 
No Real Victory
That is why we can say categorically that if the government would not crack down on the employers for violating the labor laws, it certainly won’t crack down on them for violating the president’s executive order “abolishing” discrimination. You see they are concerned first and foremost about “national defense” and “Uninterrupted production.” If this is the case, and all the evidence points that way, then the March was called off without any thing fundamental having been won.
We could understand, although we would not agree to it, calling off or postponing the March for tactical reasons, after winning a partial victory that would meanwhile build up and maintain the morale of the Negro people.
But nothing was won, nothing at all, but a recognition by Roosevelt that a problem exists and an executive order that changes nothing basic and sets up the 88th committee to investigate and recommend.
 
Damned by Own Words
Everything Randolph and White said a week ago about the memorandum still applies today. “It is not a proclamation or executive order which would give assurance of discontinuance of discrimination.” “What Negroes want now is action, not words.”
Randolph last week said: “Let the masses speak!” But now he says, “I’ll decide the questions, not you.” Randolph said, “Let the masses march!” Now he says, “It is unnecessary at this time.” Randolph stands condemned by his own words. If there is anyone who still doubts this, let him go back into the files and read the statements Randolph made when he declared the March was necessary.
 
Keep Committees Intact
Partly in order to cover up his own betrayal of the March, Randolph has called “upon the Negro March on Washington Committees in various sections of the country to remain intact in order to watch and check how industries are observing the executive order the President has issued.”
We of the Socialist Workers Party also want to warn the members of the local committees that their job is far from done.
Do not disband your committees, but on the contrary, build them stronger and larger. Get more members, more organizations, more trade unions to join in the fight. The mere threat of a March frightened Washington half out of its wits. Further organization, careful study of the problems involved, greater militancy will bring real concessions.
 
No More Sellouts!
And in addition to building the committees, the rank-and-file Negroes must take some steps to see to it that they are not again sold out. This movement does not belong to Randolph and Co. It belongs to the Negro masses, to those who contributed their time and their money to building up the movement – without which Randolph would not have been permitted to enter even the back door of the White House.
The movement belongs to the masses, and it is they who must decide its policies. This time Randolph cannot complain that there is no time for such things. Let the masses decide the policies of the movement, and let them select its leaders, let them appoint people whom they can trust to follow out their directions and aspirations.
 




Randolph, The Judas Goat
Four or five months ago A. Philip Randolph, head of the Pullman Porters union issued a statement called The Battle for Britain, which called for support by the Negro people of all aid, short of war, lo Great Britain.
Randolph was immediately answered by George Schuyler, Pittsburgh Courier columnist, who took up each of his arguments point hy point and tore them to pieces. Randolph did not try to answer Schuyler; and Randolph’s statement was widely distributed hy the war-monger ins Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies.
This week again Randolph, undaunted by the weakness and falseness of his arguments, has issued another statement. England’s Fight Our Cause.
“Negroes.” he begins, “should support ‘all out aid.’ including the Lend-Lease Bill, to Great Britain, short of war, because she is fighting the cause of democracy, the only hope and salvation of minority groups.”
Did Randolph ever hear about the British Empire? Does he know that it is the greatest corporation of slave colonies the world has ever seen? Does he know that it has more than 400,000,000 colored people under its control, that the “cause of democracy” for which it is fighting is not intended to include these 400.000,000, that the democracy of Great Britain means oppression, exploitation, dictatorial rule, discrimination segregation, excessive taxation, denial of every kind of liberty but the liberty to work for the lowest wages in the world or starve?
Randolph of course must know what this democracy means to the Negro, not only in the British Empire, but right here in the United Slates where he is Jim-Crowed and discriminated against everywhere and in everything.
 

Two Kinds of Imperialism?
“Now, of course,” he continues, “there are those who say that this is an imperialist war ... It is true ... in the sense that Germany, Great Britain and Italy are imperialist nations, and that Great Britain has been and is an oppressor of the darker races. But it does not follow that Great Britain, Germany and Italy represent equal degrees of evil and danger to the darker races and to ... progress and the cause of peace ...”
Then follows an attempt to differentiate between imperialist Germany and imperialist Britain.
Hitler has shown his contempt and disdain of the Negro people in Mein Kampf, where he calls them half-apes and sub-human. The Nazis in France pulled down Negro statues and drove the Negroes out of the country, “in other words, Hitler preaches and practices, unashamedly, his hellish hatred of all Negroes.”
Randolph then contrasts to this his version of the behavior of British imperialism. Does he say a word about the policies it is still carrying on in Africa and India and the West Indies, the denial of all rights of free speech, free press and free assemblage, the arrests of all who speak up against the war, the intensification during the war of the exploitation of the Africans to raise the money to run the war? Not a word. For then he would have to admit that while Hitler preaches and practices Negro oppression, England keeps quiet and practices it. that while Hitler calls the Negro inferior, England keeps quiet and treats him as an inferior.
Instead, Randolph points to the “co-operation Britain is giving Emperor Haile Selassie” in driving the fascists out of Ethiopia. He also points to the fact that since the raids over London, West Indian Negroes have been permitted to join the RAF. And beyond that he has nothing to say.
The fact that he can point to so few specific things which can be offered in England’s favor is proof Itself of the bankruptcy of Randolph’s position.
 

The Truth About Ethiopia
Imperialist Britain, which was largely responsible for Italy’s invasion of Ethiopia, is now described as helping to free Ethiopia today! Even Randolph knows that this is a little too much to get people to swallow, so he tries to qualify it.
“There are those who cynically remark that England’s support of the freedom of Ethiopia is inspired by a selfish interest. There would be no point in denying this. It is true. But what is wrong with it? The motivation of all great power nations is self interest. Self interest is not to be condemned if it is not anti-social and reactionary. Here, the self interest of Great Britain takes the form of fighting to help restore the independence and liberty of a smaller, defenseless nation, and thereby serves the cause of humanity and justice, though, verily, this course of action be belated.”
Thus, according to Randolph, England isn’t fighting Germany because these two gangs of bandits each want control of the colonies and their to continue its exploitation of the 400,000,000 – it’s fighting because it is interested in the freedom of Ethiopia!
“Therefore,” he says, “the Battle of Britain is the Battle of America, and the Battle of America is the Battle of the Negro ...”
If England’s fight to maintain its death grip on the colonies is the Battle of the Negro, one may logically ask why give only aid “short of war”? Randolph’s only answer, when Roosevelt and the Sixty Families give the word, will be: That’s right, we’ve got to get into the war too. And again. Randolph will have no answer to those who try to point the correct path to the workers of the world: uniting Negro and white against the imperialist gangsters on both sides and taking power to set up a socialist society.
 




Jim Crow Air Pilots
One section of Public Law No. 18 of the last Congress, adopted almost two years ago, directed the War Department to train Negro air pilots. The War Department, undoubtedly with a wink of the eye from the White House, ignored this section of the bill completely.
Last week, however, it announced that qualified Negroes would be accepted into the Army Air Corps with the formation of a squadron that will begin training this month.
This announcement has been a long time coming, and it undoubtedly would have been longer if it hadn’t been that a long series of Negro protests developed. Then Yancey Williams, engineering student at Howard University, filed suit in the United States District Court, against the Secretary of War and four major-generals, for their rejection of his application to enlist in the Air Corps. Only then did the War Department move.
But anyone who concludes from this that the generals in the Army or the bureaucrats in Washington have in any way changed their basic policies toward the Negro people, because of a little law suit, is quite wrong.
For the bone that has been thrown the Negro people to shut them up is Jim Crow through and through.
The new unit, a pursuit squadron, which will receive its flying instruction at Tuskegee Institute, Alabama, is for colored only, and will be the only unit for colored. This means that the policy of segregation, which has been praised as “satisfactory” by Roosevelt, remains untouched.
Creation of the new unit, said Undersecretary of War Patterson, “is in keeping with a policy of including colored persons in every branch of the Army.”
To which Marjorie McKenzie, Pittsburgh Courier columnist, has aptly replied:
“According to our interpretation, this is in line with a policy of excluding colored persons from every branch of the Army, except a few Jim Crow set-ups ...”
There isn’t much to the bone. When the squadron is finally organized it will include only 33 pilots and 27 planes, with a ground force of about 400 enlisted men.
Immediately after the plan was announced, the National Airmen’s Association, made up of Negro flyers throughout the country, passed a strong resolution condemning the plan and reaffirming its determination to win complete equality in the Air Corps.
“Both the army and navy have stressed tradition in arguing against the abolition of segregated units,” said C.R. Coffey, national president. “In the air corps there is no tradition, either favorable or unfavorable to complete racial integration. If we permit the establishment of a Negro unit, it will be establishing a precedent which will be hard to break down. We’d rather be excluded than to be segregated ...”
The whole incident is striking proof of our contention that regardless of what Congressional or legal action is taken or decision made, the officer clique, as long as they are in control of things, will disregard them or find some way of getting around them and maintaining their segregation-discrimination policies. The way out is to take that control away from them. That is why we call for trade union control of military training.
 

War Industries Jim Crow
The recent report by the National Urban League, the organization most closely in touch with statistics dealing with hiring and barring of Negroes from the war industries, shows that very little progress has been made in breaking down the discriminatory practices employed by the bosses and their employment managers.
According to the report, those employers who were questioned were “practically unanimous” in claiming that they barred Negroes not because they themselves personally were opposed to them, but because they were afraid that the white workers in their plants would resent it, and “it might lead tor serious labor trouble, or at least sufficient ill will to interfere with efficient production”.
In this way, the bosses who are guilty of Jim Crowing the Negro try to palm off the responsibility on the white workers – who were never consulted in a single case by the bosses about what they thought about hiring Negroes. Thus the bosses accomplish two things: they bar the Negro, and then they build up antagonism among the Negroes toward the white workers. “Divide and rule” is the motto of the bosses.
 




Fight Against Byrne’s Appointment
Shortly after the announcement that McReynolds was retiring from the United States Supreme Court, word came that Roosevelt had already chosen the man he was going to nominate to fill the vacancy, although he did not intend to make the name known for several weeks.
However, at the same time, “authoritative sources” disclosed that the man Roosevelt was referring to was Senator James Byrnes of South Carolina, one of his chief aides in pushing the “Lend-Lease” War Powers Bill.
Immediately, protest action was called for by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which said it would conduct a fight against the selection of Byrnes because he “has been absolutely consistent in opposing any and every effort to give to Negro citizens the protection of the United States Constitution.”
’The NAACP also pointed out that the three senators who most strongly favor Byrne’s appointment, Carter Glass of Virginia, Pat Harrison of Mississippi, and Alben Bartley of Kentucky, are all opponents of any kind of federal anti-lynching legislation.
The Pittsburgh Courier went back to the record and dug out the following information:

While Byrnes was in the House of Representatives, he tried to obstruct and voted against appropriations for Howard University.
 
He spoke and voted against the Dyer anti-lynching bill.
 
He voted against the resolution providing a loan of five million dollars to Liberia.
 
He placed the blame for the 1919 “race riots” in Chicago and Washington on “would-be leaders of the (Negro) race.” instead of on the boss-inspired anti-union campaigns, and said:

“If the two races are to live together in this country, it may as well be understood that the war has in no way changed the attitude of the white man toward the social and political equality of the Negro.
“If, as a result of his experience in the war, he does not earn to live in this land without political and social equality, then he can depart for any country he wishes and his departure will be facilitated by the white people of this country who desire no disturbing factor in their midst.”
The Courier, asks:
“Can the man who made the above statement and has the above record mete out equal justice to all citizens of the United States?
“If you think so, read until you’re sleepy and go on to bed.
“If you don’t think so, prepare to act.”
 

New Deal Testimony Against Byrnes!
But not even the Courier has told the whole story about Byrnes, as can be seen by a reading of Dixie Demagogues by two New Dealers, A. Michie and P. Ryhlick, who will be embarrassed, after they exposed Byrne’s record and his opposition to the more liberal legislation of the earlier New Deal, to see how closely Roosevelt is working with him today.
For Byrnes is every bit as much anti-labor as he is anti-Negro. And his nomination must be opposed not only by fighters for equality for the Negro people, but by organized labor as well.
In 1937 Byrnes was among the first to rush forward with a denunciation of the sit-down strike, and he introduced an amendment to the Guffey Coat Bill to bar sit-downs, one of labor’s strongest weapons.
He opposed the Wage-Hour Bill in the Senate, and attempted to use his influence in the House to prevent its passage. He thinks that the thousands of textile workers and sharecroppers of South Carolina are getting along well enough in their present starving, highly exploited condition.
He was one of the leaders in Congress of the relief-slashing bloc that has cut WPA to ribbons, always favoring the lowest figure offered for WPA appropriations, always in favor of the move to turn relief over to the states’ control.
An example of his die-hard opposition to the anti-lynching bill, was his reply to the question asked him in 1938 as to what likelihood there was of ending the filibuster against the anti-lynch bill:
“Not until the year 2038, unless the bill is withdrawn before then!”
The fact that Roosevelt even considers such a man for appointment to the Supreme Court should serve to disillusion many colored and white workers who have supported Roosevelt because “he’s a little better than the Republicans.”
 




Beware of Judas Goats!
Under the title, Beware of Disunity, printed in this week’s Pittsburgh Courier, Edward Lawson, managing editor of Opportunity Magazine, has written the most nonsensical and disgusting article that, has yet appeared anywhere on the question of the Negro in the present war crisis. Lawson starts off by quoting a recent statement of the National Urban League:
“The Negro must guard against the possibility that, in the excitement of the nation-wide defense program, propagandists for various groups will attempt to stir up trouble between white and colored people.”
On this he comments:
“Today that possibility is a reality. In the press, on the radio, in countless letters and handbills – and even more often by word of mouth – we are hearing today the cry, ‘Let’s solve our own problems here in the United States before we presume to interfere in the problems that beset the European nations.’”
He points to recent statements of Dr. Robert Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago, Dr. Etmnett J. Scott, leading Negro Republican, and John P. Davis, executive secretary of the National Negro Congress, to show that each (for different reasons) has advocated this view.
Lawson claims he doesn’t want to argue about the truth of their statements about conditions in this country, that he is willing to admit that. “But also,” he says in the “same breath, such statements “are dangerous.” And why?
“... because they paint for us an illusion ... that all our problems could be solved in one brief period of readjustment ... because, by oversimplifying a many-faceted situation, they lead to false hope ... because in their logical development they would set one race against another, here in America, at a time when we need more than anything else complete unity of spirit and full no-operation ... because, intentionally or not, they dovetail neatly into Hitler’s technique of propaganda against the democracies, which is divide and move in.”
Later he asks. “Could it be that Messrs. Hutching Scott, Davis, et al. are helping him (Hitler) to do this little job?”
The other little nugget in this treacherous article of Lawson’s is the following idea:
“If America were a totalitarian state, and if the dictator were sympathetic and fair-minded in his attitude toward minority groups, everything the Negro now desires could be accomplished overnight, by one stroke of the dictator’s pen, or one sweep of hie sword.
“Because America is a Democracy, the changes which we all desire for the betterment of onr lives must come gradually, through what we call the Democratic process.
“Those who would substitute some other process should first be required to demonstrate that their method would be more advantageous to us than the one we already have.”
Now we do not mention all this because we are particularly interested in defending any of the three men whom Lawson attacks. Hutchins is an isolationist who never before showed any interest in the Negro’s problems. Scott is a Republican, seeking to make political capital among the Negroes for his brand of capitalist politics. Davis is a Stalinist, interested in winning support among Negroes for Stalin’s foreign policy. With of these men will drop his interest in the Negro’s problems.
 

What Lawson Really Means
But we ARE interested in defending the idea that Negroes have no reason to support this so-called war for democracy when they themselves are deprived of democracy by the capitalist class preparing this war.
What is the “disunity” that Lawson talks about? He is talking about disunity between the Negro and the bosses who Jim Crow the Negro. To Lawson, asking for equal rights for the Negro is “disunity.” “Beware of asking for your rights” is what he is warning the Negro people.
It is fair to ask: “Whose little job is Lawson helping?” Is he helping the Negro, or is he helping Senators Bilbo and Cotton Ed Smith, when he tells the Negvo to beware of fighting for his rights? Using Lawson’s own logic, one could easily assert that, “intentionally or not,” he is helping the cause of white supremacy.
Lawson says, in effect, that Hitler is helped by a struggle for equal rights for Negroes. This is a lie. Hitler could never be helped by a struggle to wipe out racial discrimination, he is greatly weakened in his own country whenever the idea of racial superiority is wiped out anywhere in the entire world. On the contrary, Hitler (and the American Bilbos) are greatly helped whenever anyone tries to tone down the struggle for racial equality.
No where in his entire article does Lawson advocate a struggle against Jim Crowism in the armed forces or in civilian life. This omission by a so-called Negro leader is treachery to his people.
We ask Lawson: how was the Negro emancipated? By gradualness? Or by civil war? With Lawson’s method, the Negro would still be a slave. And what has happened since 1877? The policy of gradual improvement has been followed, especially as exemplified by Booker T. Washington, and with what results? The Negro doesn’t have a single right more today than he had then. Thus history has tested Lawson’s method.
We reject both the fairy tale about the benevolent dictator and the falsehood about the gradual method, and we stick to our own policy of Negro and white labor unity against capitalist oppression and discrimination, in peace-time and in war-time.
 



When Ernest Calloway told a Chicago draft board last month that he wants exemption from military service because he is a conscientious objector against the Jim Crow treatment of the Negroes in the armed forces, he opened up a very important question for all those who are serious about the fight for equal rights in the Army.
That question is: Should other Negroes follow Calloway’s example? Should they declare that they are against being trained how to fight, and refuse military training? Can such a course of action have a decisive effect on the shameful treatment of the Negro soldiers by the officer clique in charge of conscription?
There can be no doubt here, of course, of our attitude toward the attacks that the draft officials are going to make on Calloway. Already his local board has turned down his request for exemption, and although he is appealing their decision with the aid of the N.A.A.C.P., it is pretty certain that they will prosecute and attempt to jail him if he persists in his determination not to he drafted. When the draft officials and the army bureaucrats launch their attack against him, they will do it because he has opposed their draft and has given publicity to the Jim Crow regime in the Army. All workers must defend Calloway against such attacks even if they don’t agree with Calloway’s method.
But it is one thing to oppose Jim Crowism in the army and another thing to oppose it correctly and successfully.
 
What Is Wrong with Calloway’s Method
We are certain that actions such as Calloway’s will not have any decisive effect on the fight for equal rights in the armed forces. It can’t, because it leaves untouched the power of the officer caste to do exactly what it pleases. As long as the labor-hating officers have the power to do what they want with the rank-and-file soldiers, there will be Jim Crowism in the army. Not until their complete and all-powerful control over military training is taken from them can the fight for equal rights be won.
What is wrong with Calloway’s method, even if it were followed by ten other men, or 1000, or 10,000, is that it does not touch this main problem at all. Whether Calloway is sent to jail or whether he will be set free will not in any way affect or diminish the powers of the officer caste. They’ll still have the power to Jim Crow Negroes and treat them as second-class citizens.
The second major weakness in Calloways’s method (which was conceived of and proposed by a Chicago organization, known as “Conscientious Objectors Against Jim Crow,” headed by St. Clair Drake, who is also executive secretary of the local branch of the Stalinist-controlled National Negro Congress) is that it does not take into consideration at all the need of the Negro people to learn the military arts.
This is a world of war and revolution today. Every important question is being decided by military means. The Negro people too will be able to solve their problems only by struggle against their armed and trained enemies. Whoever denies that the Negro people must master the other military arts is misleading and disarming the Negroes in the face of their enemies. Whoever says that the Negro people in this country will win their freedom in any way other than by fighting for it is miseducating and confusing the Negro people.
 
Negroes Must Join Fight for Military Training
It is correct and necessary to maintain our opposition to conscription by the boss class, but it is useless to do so unless at the same time we present some other proposal which, while it will eliminate military Jim Crowism and anti-labor practices, will also provide for training the workers in the military arts.
Since the Calloway-Drake proposals ignore both the question of control of military training and the necessity for such training, they cannot be accepted as a program for Negro workers.
Since the Socialist Workers Party program for trade union control of military training has the answer to both these questions, it must be pushed by Negroes as the only real aud practical solution of discrimination and segregation in the armed forces.
To push this program requires not an arms-folded policy of individual abstention, which by itself can never win anything, but militant activity to mobilize the Negroes and the trade unions to struggle against the bosses for its realization.
 



For a long time it has been a. practice in this country for the bosses to refuse to hire Negro workers in their plants, placing the blame for this on the white workers: thus the bosses stored up a labor force among the Negroes that could be used for union-smashing and strike-breaking when the white workers began to organise. On certain occasions, employers have brazenly referred to this policy of creating resentment between black and white as “strike insurance.”
Henry Ford has played a shrewd variation of this same game. Realizing that the time would come when the unions would begin to make some headway in organizing his Empire; he began to employ Negroes in his plants, to build up the idea that he was a friend and benefactor of the Negro people and deserved their support in his bitter struggles against unionization.
He established a special division of employment of colored personnel and through this began to hire Negroes in large numbers. Today it is estimated that he has 10,000 Negro employees, representing about 10% of his labor force. As part of his plan Ford has also contributed to certain Negro churches, organizations and individuals.
 
Uncle Tom Banquet
A highlight in Fords’ anti-union campaign was a recent banquet for 300 people in Detroit by Donald J. Marshall, director of colored personnel for the Ford Motor Company.
In attendance was “nearly every colored minister in the city, who came at special invitation to get the free meal and to listen to Marshall’s harangue against the CIO. Those Negro ministers in Detroit who have expressed sympathy for the CIO were not invited; of them it was said, “The time has come to let our unfaithful leaders know we do not need them.”
“We are appealing to the ministers to try to help us keep our feet on the ground,” said Marshall.
He then launched an attack on the unions in which he blamed them because Negroes are not hired in great numbers in the other auto plants.
For instance, he showed that Knudsen, now head of the National Defense Commission, had refused to let Negroes hold skilled jobs in General Motors. What follows from that, according to Marshall? That the union which Knudsen fought so bitterly is responsible for this situation which existed long before the union was founded.
 
Ford Threatens Negroes
He finished this attack by making a not-too-veiled hint that if the Negro workers in Ford’s plants didn’t support him, they would be sorry:
“The open shop of Henry Ford has two Negroes out there to see that the Negroes get at least part of their rights (meaning himself and his assistant). The Negro will regret the day ir he helps to turn the Ford shop over to the CIO.”
By this he meant that if the CIO organizes the Ford plants, Ford will have no further use for Negroes and will try to get rid of them. “It will be a sad day for us if the Ford Company changes its policy,” moaned the Rev. Mr. Bradby, to emphasize the point.
 
Task of CIO
Horace R. Cayton, one of the authors of Black Workers in the New Unions, has in two articles in recent issues of the Pittsburgh Courier dealt with the subject in a way that could be of use to the CIO in tackling this problem.
After explaining how Ford by his financial contributions has “given substance to the myth that Ford had a sympathetic interest in the problems of the Negro,” and showing that “many Negro professional men and Negro leaders who lived on the back of these Ford employees, fearful of anything which might disrupt (even momentarily) their sources of income, are violently pro-Ford and anti-union.” Cayton goes on:
“Ford’s policy toward the Negroes, however, is one that had been born of self-interest and has not offered the Negro much except employment. That Ford has hired more Negroes than other companies is a matter of fact. He has done this, however, lo provide himself with ‘strike insurance.’
“It is the testimony of most persons familiar with the Ford plant that Negroes are definitely limited in their ability to be promoted within the Ford plant and are pretty largely confined to the lower wage income brackets.
“Likewise, all workers in the Ford plant, including Negro workers, suffered from the speed up, the possibility of brutal treatment from Ford’s service men, and enjoy a wage which is about ten cents au hour below that of workers in other automobile plants.”
 
Why Negroes Hesitate
Cayton explains clearly why Negro workers are hesitant about joining the union. First of all, they’re glad they’ve got jobs, and they’re not sure that Ford would keep them on if the union won out. Secondly, the Negro is under terrific pressure from Harry Bennett’s thugs and from Donald Marshall and the other “leaders.” Thirdly, they don’t know whether they can trust the unions, because many of them have had experiences of discrimination, or have heard of discrimination, by white workers even in the union movement.
In this situation, it is imperative that the CIO pay special attention to the Negro workers. True, R.J. Thomas, president of the UAW, has written a letter which has received some publicity, in -which he promises that, there will bo ne discrimination by thee union against Negro Ford workers. He urges that those who are interested should check in the other plants that have been organized and determine for themselves whether the Negro worker has been discriminated against. “They will find upon checking that in the Detroit plants Negroes now receive more money and have better jobs than they had prior to the advent of the union ...”
But when the scoundrels who call themselves leaders are so active in prejudicing the Negroes against the union, it is not enough to suggest that “anyone who is concerned about such rumors, (of discrimination) check in other automobile plants ...” Every one of the 10,000 Negro workers in Ford is very much concerned about these vicious rumors. To tell them to go and check in the other automobile plants is not very helpful. It is up to the UAW lo bring them the proofs that there will be no discrimination, and to spend a lot of time combating these rumors and spreading the truth that, as Cayton puts it, “the CIO has made a desperate effort to break down color barriers and it presents the greatest hope for Negro laborers since the Knights of Labor” and that “certainly Negro workers in the Ford plant will suffer greatly, both as workers and as Negroes, in the long run if they are instrumental in defeating unionism in Ford’s plants.”
 



William Pickens has a new job. It is with the federal government, in the Treasury Department. He has left his job as branch director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
This is not surprising to those who have been watching his development in recent years. After all, he was spending more time and energy supporting the war than “advancing” the colored people. For every word he wrote about the conditions of the Negroes in the United States this last year, he wrote ten about how much tougher it would be for them under Hitler.
It is fitting for Pickens to do what he has done. Pickens should be paid by his real masters, the powers whom he really serves.
There has been a lot of sound and fury about the appointment. The Negro Democrats who supported Roosevelt last year feel bitter because none of them got the job, which pays a reported $6,000 salary. They feel that Roosevelt should never have appointed a man like Pickens, who was an ardent supporter of Willkie last November.
They don’t seem to understand what is involved. Pickens didn’t get the job because of his position in the presidential elections. He got the job because of his position on something far more important: the war. Roosevelt picked him because he supports his war plans, and certainly Pickens stands out head and shoulders above all the other Negro misleaders when it comes to war-mongering. He can show the others, both Democrats and Republicans, a lot of tricks at this game.
But while the job pays well, the work will be hard. For it is Pickens’ job to sell “defense bonds” to the Negroes. This won’t be much easier than selling refrigerators to the Eskimos.
For he has two large obstacles to overcome.
First, the Negro people (this does not apply to the so-called leaders) do not see any good reason for supporting a war conducted under Jim Crow conditions to preserve a “democracy” that does not include them. And before you can get anyone to shell out money for a cause, you’re got to “sell” the cause to him.
Second, of all the groups in this country, the Negroes have less money to buy bonds than anyone else. The reason for this is, of course, that the Negroes have been Jim Crowed out of all, the better-paying jobs in expanding industry, and relegated to the hard, low-paid menial jobs or to the relief and WPA rolls, by the same capitalists who will profit from the war Pickens is supporting. Thus, even if they were in some way to be suddenly aroused, they would find it virtually impossible to buy bonds an to be able to feed and house themselves at the same time.
Yes, Pickens will have to sweat to earn the salary, that his Jim Crow masters will pay him.
 




The March on Washington
Last week the announcement was made that the march of 10,000 Negroes to Washington, to protest against Jim Crowism in industry and the armed forces, is already being organized. The date has been set fox June 30, according to the committee in charge which is composed, of A. Philip Randolph, original advocate of the march, Walter White, the Rev. William L. Imes, Lester B. Granger, Frank R. Crosswaith, Layle Lane, Richard Parrish, Dr. Rayford Logan, and Henry K. Craft.
The purpose of the march, according to this committee, is “to shake up white America, arouse official Washington and gain respect for our people.”
Organization of local committees throughput the country, and especially on the eastern seaboard, to recruit and, register marchers, raise funds through the sale of buttons, is already under way. Conferences are being held this week in New York, Jersey City, Newark, Trenton, Camden, Philadelphia and Baltimore.
 

Militant Action Is Necessary
From the beginning the Socialist Workers Party has pointed out that fighting action is necessary if the Negro people are to win a real victory over the practices of Jim Crowism in industry by the employers and in the armed forces by the government.
We said that words alone are not enough. Resolutions and telegrams are helpful, letters to Congressmen can do no harm, but if you really want to smash Jim Crowism, if you want to win jobs from the bosses who refuse to hire Negroes, if you want to finish segregation in the army and navy, you’ve got to fight.
That was why we welcomed the series of articles, by A. Philip Randolph, beginning last January, in the Negro press as a possible beginning to set the ball rolling in the right direction.
Randolph, when he takes time out from his reactionary defence of all-out aid to Britain, can make good sense if he wants to. In these articles for the most part that is what he did.
He did more than describe the situation that the Negro finds himself in today (“The whole National Defense Set-up reeks and stinks with race prejudice, hatred and discrimination”).
He also called on the Negroes to organize themselves (“power and pressure do not reside in the few, the intelligentsia, they lie in and flow from the masses. Power does not even rest with the masses as such. Power is the active principle of only the organized masses, the masses united for a definite purpose”).
And he proposed a march of 10,000 Negroes on Washington to protest against existing conditions:
“Let them swarm from every hamlet, village and town; from the highways and byways, out of the churches, lodges, homes, schools, mills, mines, factories and fields. Let them come in automobiles, buses, trains, trucks and on foot. Let them come though the winds blow and the rains beat against them, when the date is set. We shall not call upon our white friends to march with us. There are some things Negroes must do alone. This is our fight and we must see it through. If it costs money to finance a march on Washington, let Negroes pay for it. If any sacrifices are to be made for Negro rights in national defense, let Negroes make them. If Negroes fail this chance for work, for freedom and training, it may never, come again. Let the Negro masses speak!”
 

A Good Plan
Insofar as this goes, we can only hail the whole plan. A militant march on Washington, the national capital of Jim Crowism, a march made up of thousands of Negroes who will be able to get there only because hundreds of thousands of others support the march morally and financially – this would really strike fear into the hearts of the administration and the bosses. It would really put a spoke in their wheel at the time they are shrieking about “national unity” (at the expense of the workers) and taking the last steps prior to full entry into the war! It would give a real jolt to all the propaganda about a war “for democracy,” put the issue of Jim Crowism on the high plane where it belongs and organize the forces for a finish fight for full social, economic and political equality!
Correctly carried out demonstration would also establish the Negroes as a force to be reckoned with by the conservative leaders of trade unions in the AFL who are guilty of Jim Crow practices themselves, and could be used as a wedge for breaking down bars against Negro membership in those sections of the labor movement where they still exist.
Nor should it be forgotten that a correctly carried out struggle of this kind, even if actively supported at the start by only a minority of the Negro people, would be an inspiration and a source of new hope and courage to millions of other Negroes; would help to deepen and extend the local struggles of the Negroes throughout the North; and would undoubtedly serve to set off in the direction of organized struggle millions of Negroes in the South who are awaiting action from their brothers in other parts of the country, and who need only inspiring example from the rest of the working class to set them into action on a wide scale at last.
That is why the Socialist Workers Party, and advanced Negro and white workers everywhere, are 100% for support of an action of this kind.
But to be worthy of support, and to accomplish its ends, the march must (1) really be militant, (2) really involve the masses, and (3) be based on the proper set of demands.

Hillman Writes a Letter
After many months of receiving complaints from Negro and labor organizations about the Jim Crow bars that keep Negroes from getting jobs in the vital industries, Sidney Hillman, labor front for the Office of Production Management, finally has written a letter. In this letter, sent to all manufacturers receiving contracts from the government, Hillman follows his usual practice of subordinating every other consideration to that of “national defense.”
He is not interested in Jim Crowism in plants financed and in many cases built by the government because of the effect it has on the Negro people, who are largely confined to menial jobs as a result, but because of the effect it will have on the war plans of the capitalist government he is serving.
First he points out that current reports “indicate skilled labor shortage in a number of fields vital to defense production.” This situation has been aggravated because “in many localities, qualified and available Negro workers are either being restricted to unskilled jobs, or barred from defense employment entirely.” Then he goes on with his complaint:
“Such practices are extremely wasteful of our human resources and, prevent a total effort for national defense. They result in unnecessary migration of labor, in high rates of labor turnover, and they increase our present and future housing needs and social problems for defense workers.”
Then follows his suggestions for correcting this situation:
“All holders of defense contracts are urged to examine their employment and training policies at once to determine whether or not these policies make ample provision for the full utilization of Negro workers. Every available source of labor capable of producing defense materials must be tapped in the present emergency.”
 

What the Letter Means
Two things stand out in this letter.
First, Hillman is interested in Negroes being employed only because he doesn’t want the war plans of the government disrupted. Second, his letter is not going to change the present situation at all.
It should be noted that the letter does not emphasize the need for hiring Negroes where there is no shortage of labor. This can be interpreted to mean that employers should take them where they can’t get anyone else. The employers do just that anyhow. The most rabid Negro-hating employer will hire Negroes when he can’t get anyone else, because his main interest is in making profit; and to make it, he needs workers, regardless of their race or color.
Hillman wants the employers to determine whether their policies make ample provision for the full utilization of Negro workers. Very well, an employer will say, I will examine my policies and see whether they make provision for, etc.
Even assuming that Hillman really wants Negroes to get jobs, and that his letter is not just a face-saving device, what does it amount to? Little more than nothing. Because the letter does not provide a single hint of a measure to do something about those plants that refuse to “examine” their policies, and worse yet, refuse to hire Negro labor as long as they can get other workers.
An employer can toss the letter into the waste-basket, as probably most of them have done, and Hillman does not propose to do anything about it.
And so, because of the weakness of the letter and its lack of threat to take action against the employers who disregard it, we can confidently predict that nothing will come of it, any more than came of the no-discrimination statement issued several months ago by Knudsen, Hillman’s partner. Not a Negro will get a job as the result of it.
 

The OPM Could Take Action
As the Chicago Defender put it: “His letter has all the earmarks of a theatrical stunt intended only for the gallery.”
It is intended to draw away from the OPM criticism about its failure to do anything about the situation, while it continues to do nothing.
This does not mean that the OPM is powerless in the situation and is only trying to cover up its helplessness. Far from it.
Along with the President, the OPM has the power to veto any proposal of the War or Navy Department for expanding or building facilities for expediting production. Appropriation acts carrying funds for new facilities, according to Undersecretary of War Patterson, give them that authority.
This means that the OPM, by simply using its veto power, could at the very least refuse contracts to Jim Crow companies asking for funds to add to their building and equipment.
The fact that they don’t use this power, but resort instead to weak and meaningless letters, is only additional proof that they don’t want to do anything about the industrial Jim Crow bars against Negroes.
Negroes have to recognize this and to realize that they can expect no help from this direction until they are organized and strong enough to force it from them.
 




The Supreme Court Decision
It was extremely dissappointing to read the comment of the Negro press on the recent decision of the Supreme Court on the Mitchell case. Most of the press went overboard for it hook, line and sinker, hailing it as one of the most important decisions since the Civil War.
The Pittsburgh Courier went even further than most, spilling the pictures of the eight judges clear across the top of the front page and labeling it “Eight Real Americans ... They Rendered Most Momentous Decision Affecting The Race since 1857.”
Are the Courier editors kidding themselves or do they believe it? The most that could be said for the decision, so far as the great mass of the Negro people goes, was that it was a thin moral victory insofar as the position of the 10 Southern Attorneys-General was rejected.
The decision did not wipe out segregation in transportation, just as the court’s decision on the Gaines case a few years ago did not wipe out segregation in education. That is what is fundamental, and that is just what the court refused to act on.
The Negro press does not do a service to the job of clarifying the struggle for full equality when it prints such twaddle as it did on this case. Indeed, it sounds almost as ridiculous as did Mitchell himself, when he crowed after the announcement of the decision that he wants the world to know that he fought, the case single-handed and deserves “the full credit.” The only difference is that the Negro press ballyhoos the Jim-Crow Court as the protector of Negro rights, while Mitchell ballyhoos only himself.
 

Pickens Defends British Jim Crow
William Pickens has written another article in an endeavor to swing more Negroes to support of the war to defend British imperialism. His latest article is directed against George Padmore who is now in England. Padmore’s article in the March issue of The Crisis, Hitler Makes British Drop Color Bar, has aroused Picken’s ire.
We do not comment on it in order to defend Padmore, because Padmore can ably defend himself, but in order to defend the American Negro, people against the sly distortions of Pickens.
Pickens’ theme, this time, is that in England you will find far less evidence of Jim Crowism than you will find anywhere else except, maybe Honolulu, Hawaii; and that therefore Negroes should throw all their support behind the government’s steps to aid England. Once Pickens had made more than 60 lectures all over England, and he claims that “for the Negro, the worst place in England is better than the best place in the United States ...”
The trick Pickens employs here is to separate the British Isles from the British Empire and to pick out one isolated, very minor aspect of the first to justify all-out, uncritical defense of the second. We are willing to grant, for the sake of argument, the truth of Pickens’ observations about racial discrimination in England (although current reports about separate Jim Crow bomb shelters do not jibe with his pretty picture). But is that the decisive question, as Pickens tries to make it appear?
Ask Churchill, and the other imperialists, and they’ll answer only too quickly that it is not. Churchill and his class are not fighting to preserve Negro rights in the British Isles, they are fighting to preserve the British EMPIRE, which means the continued exploitation and oppression of hundreds of millions of colored workers and peasants in Africa and India and the West Indies.
Pickens is happy that two years ago in London he “could roam through the whole town, and stop and step into any public place, and eat and drink, and without receiving any discourtesy, could crowd shoulder to shoulder with the thronging English people, without a ripple of displeasure.” But when he tries to imply that this is what the British ruling class is fighting for, he knows that he is deceiving his public.
Padmore described how the progress of the war has compelled the British ruling class to temporarily lower some of the color bars against Negroes. The reason was not that they believe in equal rights for Negroes, but that they want to strengthen the imperialist system that keeps the great bulk of Negroes in subjection.
Because for every Negro who might be able to go freely in England, there were and are a thousand Negroes in Africa who can’t go where they want, or work where they want, or vote, or belong to a union, or a party, or even an African form of the NAACP.
 

NAACP Picket Lines
The NAACP picket lines scheduled to be held throughout the country on April 26 were far from the successful demonstrations against Jim Crowism that they easily could have been.
They were poorly organized, and consequently, not well attended.
This must be a lesson to, the leaders of the NAACP, or all their other efforts will also be unavailing. They must pay more attention to involving the Negro masses in the struggle against discrimination. It is necessary and correct to take care of court action, to prepare briefs for Congress, to file telegrams of protest. But unless these actions are backed up by the great hulk of the Negro people (and everyone knows they are more aroused by present day developments than ever before), nothing will come of them.
For more demonstrations involving the masses! For real preparation and organization of such demonstrations to show the real strength of the Negroes!
 




The Negro March to Washington
Last week in this column we discussed the March to Washington on July 1, and indicated the full agreement of the Socialist Workers Party with such an undertaking. We also warned that if the march were to accomplish anything, it would have to he militant, on a mass scale, and based on the proper set of demands.
It is as yet too early to determine just what the Randolph Committee means by the “militancy” which they urge the Negroes to exercise in this march. It is also too early to determine in what way the Committee, and the local groups, are going to mobilize the marchers, and whether they will really succeed in bringing out the masses.
But it is already possible to discuss the general approach of the Committee, as set forth in its Call To America (copy available from Negroes’ Committee To March On Washington For Equal Participation in National Defense, Suite 301, 217 West 125 St., New York City).
This Call is filled with militant words and some not-so-militant ideas. It demands the end of Jim Crowism; it stresses the need for action by the Negroes to bring it about; but it does not indicate the correct kind of action and program. As a result, it is filled with contradictions from one end to the other, which will have to be set-tied in one direction or another.
 

What the Call Says
In one place the Call says:
“But what of national unity? We believe in national unity which recognizes equal opportunity of black and white citizens to jobs in national defense and the armed forces, and in all other institutions and endeavors in America. We condemn all dictatorships, Fascist, Nazi and Communist. We are loyal, patriotic Americans, all.
“But, if American democracy will not defend its defenders; if American democracy will not protect its protectors; if American democracy will not give jobs to its toilers because of race or color; if American democracy will not insure equality of opportunity, freedom and justice to its citizens, black and whiter it is a hollow mockery and belies the principles for which it is supposed to stand.”
Why all those ifs? Don’t we know very well what is going on? Is there any real doubt in their minds as to exactly what is happening to the Negro in our great American democracy?
Just turn those two paragraphs around, read the second first, and you’ll get a better picture of what the Call’s declaration of loyalty amounts to. You’ll see that it is a declaration of loyalty to a hollow mockery, and that hidden behind the “ifs” is a potential surrender of the fight for full equality for the Negro people.
Maybe they don’t think so, but the ruling class in this country sees it and they will say, “Don’t worry too much about this whole business of the march; no matter how they are treated, they promise that they’ll go along and that they’ll drag the masses behind them.”
This is one of the contradictions that must he solved before a fight against Jim Crowism is going to be successful. Loyalty to a Jim-Crow system can never end in its destruction and replacement by a system of equality.
 

Kinds of Mass Action for Effective Struggle
This is not the only instance of the Call for the march making concessions to the ideas looked on with favor by the ruling class. In another place it says:
“However, we sternly counsel against violence and ill-considered and intemperate action and the abuse of power. Mass power, like physical power, when misdirected, is more harmful than helpful.
“We summon you to mass action that is orderly and lawful, but aggressive and militant, for justice, equality and freedom.
“Crispus Attucks marched and died as a martyr for American independence. Nat Turner, Demark Vesy, Gabriel, Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass fought, bled and died for the emancipation of Negro slaves and the preservation of American democracy.”
Our criticism of this section of the Call should not be mistaken to mean that the Socialist Workers Party is in favor of “ill-considered and intemperate action” or anything of the kind. Not at all.
But who is served by this reassurance that everything is going to be nice and respectable and within the “lawful” bounds established by the ruling class and its anti-labor, Jim Crow legislatures and courts?
Once again, the Bourbon politicians in Washington will smile and say, “It’s nothing to worry about, they are only letting off a little steam.”
Does this serve the interests of the struggle against Jim Crowism? If so, we fail to see it.
And if we are going to talk about history, let us talk about it correctly. Did King George the Third think that Crispus Attucks’ action was “lawful”? Did the slaveholders of Virginia think that Nat Turner was “orderly”?
The trouble is that the Randolph Committee is too much concerned about what the powers-that-be may think about them. And as long as that is true, they lead a half-hearted fight, in spite of all their talk about aggressiveness and militancy.
Considerations such as these may seem trivial on first glance, but they help to determine the character of the entire march, and those who want a successful and meaningful march must think about and correct them.
(Continued next week)
 



Although the illusion that the Democratic Administration at Washington is their government may be accepted by many workers in the North today, a Negro would have to be very gullible to be taken in by it. The argument advanced by Northern democrats of the capitalized or uncapitalized variety that “After all, it is you, the people, who elect the government and therefore it is you who are responsible for the laws of this great democracy” cannot convince the millions of Negro sharecroppers and workers who are more or less openly denied the right to vote, both by law and by terrorism.
It took a long and bloody civil war, in which the bourgeois-Republican government had to militarize over 200,000 Negroes whom it had had no intention of freeing in the first place, before the Negro people were legally recognized as human beings with equal rights, even in respect to the ballot.
But, just as the right to vote was won by force and violence and the establishment of a Northern dictatorship over the South, so was it taken away. The Ku Klux Klan and other terrorist organizations beat up and murdered the Negro voters in all the areas of the South where they could get away with it. By force and by corruption at the polls, the landlords began to recover full political power in one state after another in the 12 years following the end of the Civil War.
Finally, in 1876, the Republican industrialists of the North concluded an agreement with the Democratic landlords of the South, at the expense of the Negroes and poor whites. In return for four years’ more control of the White House, the Republicans removed the Northern troops from Southern territory and gave back complete control of the South to the land-holding ruling class that had conducted the war against the North.
The Fifteenth Amendment, however, remained on the books, and it was not possible in all places to mobilize sufficient forces to keep the Negroes from the ballot by violence alone. Ingenious lawyers were set to work by the ruling class to devise state legislation to disfranchise the Negro “legally.” Constitutional conventions were called in most of the southern states to enact these new devices into law. Mississippi showed the way; the other states that followed “improved” on the Mississippi model, which accomplished its purpose without violating the written word of the Federal Constitution.
The principal devices for disfranchising the Negro adopted at that time, most of which have been carried over to the present day, are the following: the payment of poll or other taxes before registration can take place, literacy qualifications, property qualifications, the “grandfather clause.”
 
Virginia – A Mirror of “Democracy”
A typical example of the proceedings of these state conventions may be found in the Virginia convention of 1901, at which Carter Glass, “Unreconstructed Rebel” and Roosevelt’s dear friend, made his first bid for fame.
The Negro had been almost completely disfranchised in Virginia, by that time. But the ruling class, fearing a future alliance at the polls between white and Negro sharecroppers and small farmers, called this convention to “protect and guarantee” white supremacy, that is to say, to legalize the disfranchisement of the Negro, and through it, of many whites as well.
Glass, one of the leading advocates of the $1.50 poll tax, was loud in his promises to the delegates that the poor whites would not be affected by it. He spent most of his energy explaining the advantages of adopting his own “understanding clause” in addition to the poll tax. Under this, a Negro applicant who wants to vote and has already paid his poll tax, can be disqualified if he cannot “understand” some selected clauses of the constitution, and “explain them to the satisfaction of the white election official.” In some states, as Roscoe Conklin Simmons of the Chicago Defender puts it, these questions may be “something like this: ‘What is the difference between a pure democracy and governments described in the Federalist’.”
In this way, any Negro may be kept from the ballot in a “legal” way, and indeed many a Negro of college education in the South has been found who couldn’t explain these things to the “satisfaction” of the officials.
Glass took the floor to point with pride to
“... the uncontroverted fact that the article of suffrage which the convention will today adopt does not necessarily deprive a single white man of the ballot, but will inevitably oust from the existing electorate four-fifths of the Negro voters. That was the purpose of the convention; that will be its achievement.”
When someone asked if the Negro was not being deprived of his vote by fraud and discrimination, Glass answered:
“By fraud, no; by discrimination, yes. But it will be discrimination within the letter of the law, and not in violation of the law. Discrimination! Why that is precisely what we propose; that exactly is what this convention was elected for – to discriminate to the very extremity permissible under the limitations of the Federal Constitution with a view to the elimination of every Negro voter who can be gotten rid of, legally, without materially impairing the numerical strength of the white electorate ... As has been said, we have accomplished our purpose strictly within the limitations of the Federal Constitution by legislating against the characteristics of the black race, and not against the ‘race, color or previous condition’ of the people themselves. It is a fine discrimination, indeed, that we have practiced in the fabrication of this plan.”
While the delegates may have agreed that this was a “fine” discrimination, they were not sure that the poor white farmers might not understand that they too could be barred in great numbers from the ballot and therefore vote against this constitution, so the convention agreed not to submit it to the voters. Like Mississippi’s, the new Virginia constitution was just proclaimed in effect, and left at that.
That the fears of the small farmers and sharecroppers had been justified was shown at the very next election. Of a population of 1,854,184 in the 1900 presidential election, 264,095, or 14.2% had voted. In 1904, after the new constitution went into effect, the total vote was 129,111 – or less than half the vote of 1900, which had already been much lower than the national average because of the terror employed against Negro voters.
It is interesting to note that Virginia is supposed to be one of the more advanced and liberal southern states, being one of the old border states. Nevertheless, although its population increased over 800,000 from 1900 to 1940, and its voting population increased by more than 80,000 in the same period, it has never regained to this day the same percentage of voting population it had in 1900 prior to the proclamation of the new constitution. In the 1940 presidential election, only 12.9% of the people were permitted into the polls.
 
Devices of Disfranchisement
In many states clauses were adopted which were supposed to guarantee to the poor or the unlettered whites that they would not be discriminated against by such things as literacy and “understanding” tests. Among these was the “grandfather clause,” which was finally declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1914, when many other substitutes for it had already been found and put into practice. This clause gave the voting right to those who themselves or whose parents had had it prior to a certain date. The date set in each case was 1861 or earlier, before the slaves had been freed. It accorded permanent registration without tax or other qualifications, and was designed to eradicate the suspicion of the poor whites that they, too, would be disfranchised.
This clause, however, was never very widely used. In his book, Race, Class and Party, Paul Lewinson quotes the fears of an Alabama newspaper that there were “large numbers of Negroes, who perhaps would not be unable to establish legitimacy of birth, but who could nevertheless easily establish the identity of white fathers and grandfathers” and thus win a vote. But it is certain that the southern landlords were not sorry to see this law wiped off the books, for with it went the bother of troubling about a large section of the poor white vote.
Another measure designed to gain support of the illiterate whites was the property qualification which is still used in some states as an alternative to literacy tests. In Alabama, for example, 40 acres of land or $300 worth of property, in Georgia, 40 acres of land or $500 of property, entitle an individual to a vote. Possession of this property permits admitted illiterates the right to vote.
While many variants of the old devices are still in use, even though court rulings have sometimes made it necessary to streamline them, the two main legal devices of present day usage are the poll tax and the white primary laws.
The poll tax legislation was quite frankly intended, as were the other devices, to strike at the “characteristics” of the Negro people, both real and assumed, as a means of getting around the amendments to the federal constitution that prohibit discrimination because of race or color. And the Supreme Court did not find in it any violation of the 14th Amendment because it could find “nothing in the text of the provision that could possibly be said to expressly discriminate because of race or color.” In other words, according to the court, the fact that the Negroes, because of their economic status, could not or did not pay the poll tax was not the fault of the statute, and therefore could not be held against the statute.
The three main “characteristics” of the Negro, on which the southern legislators based their device of disfranchisment, were his “poverty,” his “laziness,” and his habit of being “notoriously careless about keeping receipts of any kind.” Actually, it was only the first that really characterized the average Negro in the South; the others were added as trimmings for “white supremacy.”
Certainly, to the average Negro sharecropper, the sum of $1.00 to $3.00 a year is not a light consideration. Payment of such a poll tax is a heavy price for what is not yet the right to vote but only the right to register to vote, as will be shown later in discussing the white primary. Allan A. Michie and Frank Ryhlick, in their book Dixie Demagogues, say of the Texas poll tax:
“The $1.75 poll tax seems small, but, to hundreds of thousands of impoverished whites, Mexicans and Negroes, it represents food for another week or a new pair of shoes for one of the children.”
Only a rare individual would deprive his family of $1.75, when it means so much, for the privilege of paying a poll tax which by itself gives no guarantee of a vote.
In many poll-tax states, not only is payment of the poll tax for the current year required, but payment of all accumulated poll taxes for previous years as well! Moreover, in Georgia, for example, penalties are attached to late payment of the tax amounting to a 7% interest fee and a collection fee. It is easy to understand why, once a sharecropper falls behind in payment of his tax, it is almost impossible for him ever to catch up again. His disfranchisement becomes practically permanent.
In most states the legislators took advantage of the second “characteristic” of “laziness” by setting the date for payment of the poll tax a good many months before the elections or the primaries. Since the Negro was “lazy,” they figured, he would never bother to pay his tax so long before elections.
In Texas, the tax must be paid on or before January 31. “That is winter, even in Texas,” Michie and Ryhlick point out, “when conditions are hardest and the primaries are several months off. Even if a citizen gets excited over the election later in the year, he cannot enfranchise himself under any provision.”
The third “characteristic,” keeping receipts, may seem trivial, but it is not really so. Not only is payment of the poll tax made mandatory, but producing the receipt for it before registration or election officials. In the long period between payment of the poll tax and the elections, many people may lose their receipts. Election officials may then exclude Negroes from registration, while admitting to the polls their white political friends who hadn’t paid the tax by the simple expedient of forgetting to ask for it.
The poll tax money is also craftily used to bribe the white voters into acquiescence. Of the $1.75 collected in Texas, $1.50 goes to the state and $.25 to the county. $1.00 of the state’s share goes into the school fund, and the demagogues offer the masses of disfranchised workers this alternative: either keep up the poll tax or ruin the school system of the state and deprive your children of all opportunity to get an education.
 
The “Democratic Primary”
While the poll tax denies millions of both Negroes and whites the right to vote, the “white primary,” or “Democratic primary,” as it is sometimes called, is a measure much more clearly aimed at the Negro alone.
This measure was invented to hold back the few Negroes who manage to get past the other barriers of poll tax, literacy, understanding, property, etc. Under present conditions in the South, it is more effective than the others, because while the overcoming of the other obstacles depends to a very small extent upon the position of the individual, the white primary applies to the Negro people as a whole and excludes them as such.
This device is based upon the idea that a political party has the right to determine who shall belong to it and who shall participate in its primary elections which select its candidates and determine its policies. Under it, the party’s state or county committees may and do decide that no Negro of whatever political viewpoint is eligible for membership or participation in the primaries, at the same time that thousands of white Republicans are freely admitted to vote in all its primary elections.
This situation prevails only because the South, like Germany, Italy and other totalitarian places, suffers under one-party rule. The Republican Party doesn’t amount to two cents there, and the Democratic ticket alone wins the elections. To be able to vote in the regular elections under these conditions without having voted in the primaries is useless, as the real elections in the South take place in the Democratic primaries, where campaigning is heated and places fiercely contested for. It is well known that far more people vote in the Democratic primaries than in the regular elections for all parties. Most people don’t bother to go to the polls for regular elections because the winning candidate has already been chosen and the issues settled in the primaries. Casting a vote for the Republican Party in the South is like casting it into the Atlantic, and minority parties can’t even get on the ballot.
Under the white primary device, therefore, the Negro who has passed all other tests is given the right to vote only for those candidates and platforms which have been decided in a white man’s primary, from which he has already been excluded.
It is understandable why most Negroes don’t bother to go through all the other obstacles to voting. It is not surprising that they don’t want to spend from $1 to $3 for the useless right to vote for candidates whom they had no part in choosing, or for candidates who are certain to be defeated. It is no wonder that The Waco Messenger in January of this year, while complaining bitterly about the indifference of the average Negro voter to the approaching deadline for payment of the poll tax, was able, in attempting to correct this attitude, only to point to “other elections,” such as those for the school board and the city commission, where there are no primaries (and no very important questions are settled).
Just as the poll tax has been taken to the courts, so the white primary is being contested there too. Leo Alilunas, in his Legal Restrictions on the Negro in Politics, in The Journal of Negro History, April 1940, has correctly summed up the attitude of the courts to date:
“The expedient adopted by the Democratic party in the various states has been recognized by the judiciary, both state and federal, as being constitutional, and not in violation of the 14th and 15th Amendments. The judiciary has ruled that a party, being a voluntary organization, is competent to determine its personnel.”
 
The Stronghold of Reaction
Now what is the effect of these measures on political life in the South, and, through the South, on the Nation? First of all, it means that the masses of people, Negro and white, have no method of registering protests at the polls against anything or anyone. Secondly, it means that they play no more part in southern government than do the inhabitants of Alaska. Thirdly, it means that the political and state machinery of the South belong to the ruling class just as completely and openly as the land and factory machinery belong to them. Fourthly, it means that the South sends to Congress, year after year, the most reactionary political figures in the nation, who feel no pressure whatsoever from those whom they are supposed to represent, and who play a role in Washington legislation far out of proportion to the number of people who elected them.
An examination of voting percentages during the 1940 presidential elections shows clearly what kind of democracy exists in those southern states whose representatives are the staunchest defenders of the President’s program for a “war for democracy.”

As compared with these states, Illinois got a 53.4% vote. Other states in the northern, eastern and western sections of the country ranged down from that figure through the 50’s and 40’s. The national average was 35%. That is to say, only 2 of the 13 southern states came anywhere near the national average, which, it must be remembered, is lowered precisely by these southern states.
By restricting the right of franchise to the ruling class and its middle class retainers, the “representatives of the people” in the South are able to return to the same seat in Congress again and again. The turn-over from the South being much smaller than the other states, where greater electoral participation by the masses succeeds in sweeping unpopular officials out of office more quickly, southern politicians usually have greater seniority than others.
As a result, they have a stranglehold on important and strategic positions in all the leading committees of Congress, where they faithfully serve those whom they really represent, the big business and land interests. Not only are they able to use these positions to kill in committee measures of special interest to the South, such as anti-lynch legislation, but to unite with reactionary groups from other states to hold up national wage and hour legislation, WPA and housing appropriations, etc.
This year, for example, as the Norfolk Journal and Guide put it,
“We have this situation as a result of the self-perpetuating poll tax dynasties ... 17 out of 33 chairmanships in the Senate and 18 out of 48 chairmanships in the House will be filled by men from 13 out of the 48 states. In addition, this minority group of states will furnish the Speaker of the House, the Senate Majority Leader and the leader of the Democratic caucus.”
Men from little more than one-quarter of the states will be chairmen of more than half the Senate committees and more than one-third of the House Committees! The reader of history will be struck immediately by the similarity between the situation existing just before the Civil War, when the South by counting three-fifths of the slaves toward its population was able to wield an undue influence in both houses, and the present situation when the South is getting representation for all the millions of Negro and white farm hands and wage slaves who can’t vote any more than could the Negro slaves of 80 years ago.
 
Proposed Remedies
Besides taking the issue of the poll tax to the courts, attempts have been made to repeal it by legislation. The attempts have included a bill to prohibit the collection of the tax as a requirement for voting in elections for members of Congress, the Senate and the President of the United States (the Geyer Bill which would end the poll tax for federal elections, but not touch it in state elections), a bill “to enforce the 14th and 15th Amendments” that would base representation in Congress from the states on the basis of the total number of votes cast in the last general election, instead of on the population (the Marcantonio bill, which would give the Bourbons the choice of letting the masses vote or having their representation in Congress cut); and bills in the various state legislatures to abolish the poll tax altogether.
All these bills are worthy of support, although it is interesting to observe the extremely varied motives of their sponsors. Geyer, a California Democrat, wants to sweep the southern Democrats out of their prominent and often dominating position in the party and win undisputed control of it for his own wing, gain Negro support for the Democrats in the non-southern states, and perhaps avert explosions which may be brewing among the southern masses. It is unlikely that his proposal will be accepted by Roosevelt when he is today forced to lean so heavily for passage of his war bills on these same southern congressmen who are elected only because of the poll tax and similar measures.
On the other hand, a man like Senator Bilbo of Mississippi, also favors abolition of the poll tax in his state. He is one of the South’s most rabid Negro-baiting demagogues, who has advocated sending all the Negroes back to Africa. He wants to restore the right of the poor white farmers to vote in order to provide the mass base for a continuation in office of fakers like himself who pretend to represent the interests of the southern white farmers against the attacks of Wall Street and Big Business.
While the passage of the Geyer bill or one like it is certainly necessary, it is an illusion to believe that mere adoption of such a measure will to any substantial degree change the situation, especially as regards the Negro.
For, over and above all these legislative and statutory restrictions, stands the open threat of violence and terrorism by the night-riding landlords and their vigilantes. It must be remembered they were able to secure passage of these anti-democratic measures only by terrorizing and intimidating the Negro and confusing the poor white masses, and that they have been able to maintain the present status only by the threat (and use) of the mob, the rope and the torch.
The Negro people will be able to win back their voting and civil rights only when they are prepared to fight and take them. Passage of a poll-tax bill will not be a substitute for such preparations, as can be seen by looking again at the 1940 voting percentages of Florida and North Carolina which abolished the poll tax in recent years.
Negroes got a measure of democracy in the South for the first time after the Civil War through the establishment of a bourgeois dictatorship that protected them for a while against southern reaction. By force and violence and agreement with the Republican capitalists of the North, the southern ruling class recaptured power and destroyed the Negro’s democratic rights. Only by the struggle for establishment of a new dictatorship, this time of the exploited working class aided by the oppressed farmers and sharecroppers will a new period of real democracy be inaugurated in which the Negro will not simply regain his rights but be integrated as an equal in the brotherhood of all the toilers.




The March on Washington
The Socialist Workers Party recognizes the need for action such as the proposed march of 10,000 Negroes on Washington to protest against discrimination and Jim Crowism in the armed forces and industry. That is why, in spite of our disagreements on many things with the Randolph Committee making the march preparations, we have endorsed the march and will support it in every way possible.
Our support, while it is complete, is not uncritical. It is the duty of all those who support militant action against Jim Crowism to point out the shortcomings in the proposals of the Randolph Committee – to prevent, if possible, mistakes which can have a very bad effect on the action as a whole, and which can demoralize and discourage those militants who are supporting the March.
Last week we criticized the half-hearted approach of the Committee, as demonstrated in its Call To Negro America. We could also criticize the organizational preparations for the march; the fact that so far very little has been done about informing and arousing the masses of Negroes to action, although the date for the action, July 1, is little more than a month away; that apparently insufficient attention is being paid to the task of drawing the trade unions into the struggle.
But an even more important concern than how the march is being organized, and how many people are being drawn into it, is the question: What are the marchers going to demand when they get to Washington?
Militancy is necessary, the participation of the masses is required, but what they actually seek is the decisive thing. There would be no sense in 10,000, or even 100,000 Negroes marching on Washington and fighting for something which will not solve their problems.
 

What Randolph Wants
The Randolph Committee is making its central demand the issuance of an executive order by the president of the United States abolishing discrimination in the armed forces, all government departments, and industry holding contracts from the government.
According to the present plans, this will be the request of the march in Washington. The local demonstrations will also call on the city governmental bodies to memorialize the president to issue this order.
To understand the theory behind this, one has to read the article, Why P.D. Won’t End Defense Jim Crow, by A. Philip Randolph, published in the Negro press several weeks ago. It starts this way:
“President Roosevelt can issue an executive order tomorrow to abolish discrimination in the Army, Navy, Air Corps, Marine and on all defense contracts awarded by the Federal Government, on account of race or color, and discriminations against colored people would promptly end.” (Our emphasis.)
Now if this statement means anything at all, it means that discrimination and segregation continue to exist in the government and the armed forces and in industry only because the president hasn’t issued an order abolishing them.
Just to pose the question that way is to show how ridiculous Randolph’s statement really is.
Jim Crowism does not depend for its existence on the lack of executive orders abolishing it. li exists because it serves the interests of the capitalist ruling class to keep the working class in a position where it is divided and split along racial lines and therefore more easily exploited.
 

The Demand Is Inadequate
Undoubtedly it will be very difficult to get a man like Roosevelt to issue such an order. The Randolph Committee does not do the Negro people a service when it calls Roosevelt “a great humanitarian and idealist.” Calling him nice names will not make the man, who for eight years has refused to even speak one word against the crimes of lynching in the south, suddenly issue an order abolishing all forms of Jim Crowism. Praise of Roosevelt will not produce any changes in the administration that refuses to even pass the poll tax bill. After all, what is the march on Washington for – to praise F.D.R. or to bury Jim Crowism?
In our opinion, forcing the issuance of such an order from Roosevelt would be a definite step forward in the struggle for abolition of all racial discrimination. It would not “promptly end” discrimination, as Randolph claims, but it would make it easier to fight specific cases of discrimination. That is why, in a clear and cool manner, without fooling ourselves as Randolph does, we are able to endorse this demand.
But while we endorse it, we also believe that it is not enough, that it is insufficient as the central demand of the march.
It is insufficient because it does not go to the heart of the question of discrimination. There have been and there still are plenty of laws and rulings and orders on the books, prohibiting discrimination. In spite of them, Jim Crow still rides high. There are the federal constitution, state laws, the selective service bill and plenty of other rulings from Washington. Everyone knows they are ignored.
If this is so, the Negroes who march on Washington must demand more than the issuance of an executive order. Just what is it that they should ask for?
(Continued next week)
 



Looking through the Negro press the last week or so, we got a bird’s eye view of what many of the so-called “leaders” of the Negro people are up to. It has become a practice to call such people who betray the interests of the Negro masses “Uncle Toms”, but in actuality using such a term for these people is a slander of the original Uncle Tom.
* * *
The handful of Negro soldiers now being trained as officers by the Army are all getting their training in the same camps as white soldiers. Here they are by no means free from discrimination and segregation, but since they are in the same camps they escape some of the more obvious Jim Crow treatment they might have to suffer in separate camps.
Up pops that Negro advocate of Negro segregation, Edgar G. Brown, leader of the United Government Employees, with the request to Roosevelt and Secretary of War Stimson that a Jim Crow officers training school be established.
This gave a newscaster broadcasting over the Mutual Broadcasting System the opportunity to say, “A large group of the most responsible Negro leaders in the country has appealed to President Roosevelt in a formal, official letter opposing the present policy of the army whereby Negro officers are being trained in the same schools as white officers.”
And. according to the Chicago Defender, “anti-Negro forces in Washington and particularly the War Department are reported to be delighted at the request of Brown ... since it permits them to justify segregation on the ground that Negroes themselves have asked for it.”

In Little Rock, Arkansas, the CIO has been active organizing cotton oil mill and compress workers, laundry workers, domestic workers, etc., many if not most of whom are Negro men and women. After the establishment of Camp Robinson, for example, the demand for domestic workers for the officers’ families rose – but the wages didn’t, remaining at $3–4 a week. The CIO is organizing these workers and trying to win them a minimum of $1 a day. The laundry workers too are grossly underpaid, overworked and exploited, and ready to respond to organization. The mill operators and planters in the area are getting a little worried, for they fear that the current CIO drive may make headway into the more important industries, and they are preparing to fight the CIO in every way possible.
So along come two Negro stooges, Attorney R.J. Booker of the Negro Chamber of Commerce and C.H. Jones of the so-called “Southern Mediators Association” calling meetings and issuing statements as “Negro” leaders urging the Negro workers to have nothing to do with the CIO and in general doing everything within their power to prevent them from receiving the benefits of unionism.

Only two months ago Governor Stassen of Minnesota was widely attacked in the Negro and labor press for his refusal to permit Negroes to serve in the state Home Guards.
Then about two weeks ago Stassen came out with a statement calling on employers to hire Negroes without discrimination, one of those cheap statements that sound good and cost nothing.
Now, from Washington, D.C., Emmett J. Scott, who as “Negro advisor to the Secretary of War” did his “bit” in World War I in convincing the Negro people that it was a “war for democracy”, and who knows what Stassen’s record is, comes out with a disgusting article praising Stassen because he is one of those “engaged in battling the forces of intolerance and bigotry – not lip service-battling, but real battling ...”

Today the Negro people have the greatest need and opportunity for agitation and struggle for equal rights. The government forces who want to stifle free speech also want to take away from the Negroes the right to speak and agitate against Jim Crowism, and in the name of “national defense” they propose to do this.
Dean Gordon Hancock, writing in his column, Between The Lines, this week gives them aid and comfort in their plans when he says:
“Freedom of speech is a fine thing in times of peace, but it becomes exceedingly dangerous in times of war. At a time when we have to be concentrating everything on getting this nation’s mind made up to fight a war that is inevitable, we are still crying ‘freedom of speech’ with the result that our councils are divided and the people are confused and the nation is just piddling around. Whether we have a dictatorship or not, we certainly need one, and that very badly ...”
* * *
This is only a small fraction of the large-scale treachery reported in the press in the last week or so. But as we were saying, alongside of some of these people. Uncle Tom was just a harmless old coot. Even if his philosophy was that they could beat his poor old body but his soul belonged to God, at least he didn’t go around selling out other Negroes to their oppressors. And he was supposed to be uneducated unlike many of these lawyers and doctors. And he didn’t pretend to be a leader!
 



In the two speeches he delivered on the occasion of the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Russian Revolution, Stalin tried to calm the fears of the Soviet masses about the defeats suffered by the USSR in the war against German fascism. He tried to explain away the defeats, and to justify the course the Stalinist regime has followed.
But what he succeeded in doing was to make it plain that the Stalinist bureaucracy has no plan or strategy for victory; that Stalinism is responsible for the terrible Soviet defeats; that in spite of the critical position the workers state occupies today, Stalin refuses to adopt the revolutionary policies which alone can save the Soviet Union in this war.
Stalin admits that by itself the Soviet Union is unable to defeat Hitler, for he explains what he calls the “temporary reverses” by the fact that the Soviet Union is fighting Germany alone, without the military help of allies, without
the aid of a “western front,” and by the fact that the Soviet Union does not have as many tanks and aircraft as Hitler who is able to draw on the resources and industries of most of Europe.
Stalin tries to console the masses with the hope that the “democratic” imperialists will come to the aid of the Soviet Union by opening a “western front.” Aside from thus leaving the fate of the USSR in the hands of the imperialists, Stalin presents no program to save the USSR.
He points to the undeniable instability and contradictions in Hitler’s position, and declares that eventually “in another few months, another half or one year perhaps, Hitlerite Germany must burst of its own weight of crimes.”
He asserts that Hitler’s conquest of Europe has by no means destroyed the resistance and opposition of the European masses to Hitlerism, and declares that the “new order” is “a volcano ready to erupt at any moment and bury the Germany imperialistic house of cards,” and that the rear of Hitler’s army in Germany itself is ready to turn against him.
Thus is indicated the policy which can make up for the shortcomings in Soviet production, and destroy the fascist regime in spite of its advantages in machinery and military experience:
What is required for this is a revolutionary appeal to the German and the European working class to rise up against fascism: the assurance that they will not be alone or isolated in this struggle, but that they will be joined and supported by all the resources of the Red Army and the Soviet Union. What is necessary is a revolutionary appeal that will disintegrate Hitler’s rear, that will move the German masses into action against the system that oppresses them.
 
Stalin Takes No Step
But Stalin does not breathe even the suggestion of a revolutionary appeal to the German workers. If Hitler’s regime is to be toppled from behind, if Hitler’s doom is “inevitable”, in a few months or a half year or a year, Stalin proposes to wait for history to accomplish it Meanwhile, though the danger to the USSR increases, he himself refuses to take a single step to move the German workers into revolutionary action.
For Stalin has placed his hopes in the hands of the “democratic” imperialists. For fear of alienating them, he will not even suggest, let alone try to aid, a workers’ revolution in Germany.
Indeed, far from doing anything to arouse the German workers in this Way, Stalin’s policies only drive the German masses still closer to Hitler, and help to destroy every possibility of convincing them they must not aid Hitler in the destruction of the workers state.
For Stalin completely identifies the war of the USSR with the imperialist war of Great Britain, and claims that England, the United States and the USSR are in a “single camp,” that “the Soviet Union’ and its allies are waging a war of liberation – a just war calculated for the liberation of the enslaved peoples of Europe and the USSR” and that armies of the USSR, Great Britain and the other allies as armies of liberation.”
Hitler and Goebbels secure the support or at least the non-opposition of the German masses by warning them that although they have known suffering in the war, they will, if Germany loses the war, face even greater suffering in the form of a new Versailles Treaty to crush Germany and make its people pay for the costs of the war. The only way to deprive Hitler of this bludgeon held over the German masses is by showing them that they can escape this terrible prospect even if Hitler loses the war.
But Stalin, by declaring that imperialist Britain wages a just war, and by declaring that the Soviet Union is in one camp with Britain, and by refusing to promise to fight against a new Versailles succeeds only in driving the German masses still closer to Hitler – thus alienating them further from the workers State.
Stalin spoke on the anniversary of the Russian Revolution. But he was careful to avoid all references to the true meaning and tradition of that revolution, which he has trampled on and betrayed.
Trying to show that all was not lost in spite of the defeats suffered in this war under his leadership, Stalin turned back for a moment to the days of the Civil War and the intervention in 1918–20 when the young workers state was almost overthrown.
“At that time almost three-fourths of our country was in the hands of foreign interventionists ... We had no allies, no Red Army – we had only just begun to create it – we experienced a shortage of bread, a shortage of arms, a shortage of clothing. At that time 14 states were pressing against our country, but we did not despair ...”
In spite of its material disadvantages, the Soviet Union was saved. And today, according to Stalin, the Soviet Union is in a much stronger position, so:
“Is it possible then to doubt that we can and must gain victory over the invaders?”
But Stalin dared not tell the truth about the Civil War days. He dared not tell that the Bolsheviks, under Lenin and Trotsky, never for a moment placed reliance on the imperialists, even when momentarily they were allied to them, that at all times they turned to the working class of the world, and particularly the workers in the armies and the countries of the enemy, and called on them to save the workers state.
He does not dare admit that what saved the Soviet Union was this policy of revolutionary war, which neutralised the mechanical and numerical superiority of its enemies’ forces by setting the worker – and peasant-soldiers into action against their own imperialist rulers.
It is not too late to save the Soviet Union, as the experiences of the Civil War days showed. But it can be saved only by the policy of revolutionary war which Stalinism fears and refuses to adopt.
 



The Soviet soldiers, workers and peasants who have borne the full brunt of the German fascist attack during the past five months will have to continue to bear it alone in the next period. This was made clear last week by authoritative representatives of the British and American ruling classes.
Stalin’s speech of November 6, directed partially toward the British and American governments and appealing to them for the creation of a “western front”, has been answered. He has been told that he’s not going to get a “western front” for a long, long time.
In answer to Stalin’s plea, Prime Minister Churchill spoke before the House of Commons on Nov. 12 and declared that:
“If we are able to get through this year we shall certainly find ourselves in a good supply of ships in 1942, and if the war against U-boats and enemy aircraft continues to prosper as it has done – about which of course there can be no guarantee – it seems to me that the freedom- loving powers will be possessed of large quantities of ships in 1943 which will enable overseas operations to take place utterly beyond British resources at the present time.”
That is to say, if all goes well, and if it suits his purposes, Churchill promises that “in 1943” the “freedom-loving powers”, Britain and her allies, may perhaps be able to open a “second front”.
Churchill was not speaking for the British ruling class alone. He was also speaking for the American imperialists. The New York Times, authoritative spokesman for Roosevelt and America’s Sixty Families, made this clear in no uncertain terms in its leading editorial on Nov. 10:
“(There is) the slim hope of preserving an eastern front. There is no possibility of opening a new one in the west ... There is still hope that by bending every effort toward sending war supplies to Russia a catastrophe can be averted there, but it is preposterous to believe that Russia’s fate lies entirely in the hands of this country and Great Britain. It would be well for the Administration to point out some of the difficulties in the way of helping Russia as well as the need for doing so ... the effectiveness of what assistance we can give and deliver depends upon Russia’s ability to help herself in the immediate future.”
The “democratic” imperialists would no doubt like to open a “western front” – not for the purpose of saving the Soviet Union, but for the purpose of striking Hitler a blow while most of his forces are occupied in the east. But for many reasons – military, geographic, technical and political – they are sure that it would not serve their own interests to attempt it at this time. Whatever the reason, it is deal’ that they are not even going to attempt to open a new front in the next period.
 
Stalin Explained and Promised
In his November 6 speech, Stalin had explained the defeats suffered by the Soviet Union primarily by “the absence of a second front in Europe against the German fascist armies.” In this way he is preparing to shift the responsibility for the defeats from his own policies onto the shoulders of his “democratic” imperialist allies.
He did more than that. He also promised the Soviet masses that “undoubtedly this (a second front) will appear in the near future.” In this way he tried to reassure the masses that his policy of depending on the “democratic” imperialists, which has brought only defeats up to now, would save the USSR “in the near future” when these “allies” would come to the rescue of the USSR.
The answer of the “democratic” imperialists did two things at the same time:

It demonstrated that Stalin’s policies have from the beginning been based on an illusion – the illusion that if Stalin throttled the program of revolutionary war against Hitler, if he did nothing to arouse the revolutionary spirit of the masses of Germany and Europe, if he proclaimed unconditional support of the war of the “democratic” imperialists, they would come to the rescue of the Soviet Union.
 
It means, furthermore that a continuation of the Stalinist policy – under conditions when the USSR must face Hitler’s armies alone – is bound to end in catastrophe for the workers state.

Stalin in his speech and the local Stalinists a score of times in the Daily Worker have virtually admitted that the Soviet Union cannot hope to defeat Hitler alone. Does it mean now, when it is clear to all that a “western front” is wishful thinking on Stalin’s part, that the Soviet Union is doomed?
This is the perspective as long as the war of the USSR is conducted along the lines of the Stalinist policy!
 
How to Save the USSR
The way out now for the Soviet Union is the disintegration of Hitler’s forces from the rear, from within Germany and from within the German army itself. Since Stalin admits that the USSR by itself cannot stop the advance of the German troops – and since Stalin himself no longer denies the shortage of tanks and aircraft and he himself explains that the Germans “now have at their disposal not only their own tank industry but also the industries of Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland and France” – it is obvious that the disintegration of the Hitler regime from the rear is the only way out, the only way the Soviet Union can compensate for the shortcomings of its own war machine.
But Stalin’s program for accomplishing this has thus far, been to rely on the armies of the “democratic” imperialists to attack and undermine Hitler from the rear. Over and above this he offers only his own recent boasts that eventually in “a few more months, another half year, perhaps a year, and Hitler Germany must collapse under the burden of her crimes.”
And meanwhile? Meanwhile what will happen to the Soviet Union with its admitted shortages of tanks and aircraft? In five months under Stalin’s policy, the workers state has lost vital European territory and more than two-thirds of its productive capacity. It is in a far weaker position than it was five months ago, and less able to offer effective resistance. What will happen while Stalin is awaiting the verification for his pleas and boasts?
 
What the German Workers Fear
The chief obstacle to the overthrow of Hitler by the German workers is their fear of what will happen if the “democratic” imperialists win the war. They know from the pronouncements of the “democratic” statesmen that an even worse fate awaits them after this war than was imposed by the Versailles Treaty on the German people after the last war. That is why they are afraid to move, for they do not yet see any allies in the revolutionary fight first against Hitler and then against the “democratic” imperialists. Goebbels’ main weapon in maintaining “discipline” in Germany is precisely this threat which he is now able to hold over their heads. Stalin’s plea for a “western front” by the imperialists against Germany has played right into the hands of Hitler and Goebbels who use it demagogically to identify the war of the USSR with the reactionary war being waged by the “democratic” imperialists.
The German masses can be moved into action against Hitler – only by the policy of revolutionary war which Stalin refuses to employ. Only by a revolutionary appeal to the German workers to rise up against their capitalist oppressors and join the Soviet masses in the straggle for the Socialist United States of Europe and the world. Only by the assurance to the German workers that the Soviet masses will fight side by side with them against all the forces of reaction.
Hitler will not fall, as Stalin promises, under the “weight of his crimes”. He will fall only when the German masses begin to move. And they will begin to move only when they see a chance for success, only when they feel they have a fighting chance, and a real way out.
 
What Revolutionary Policy Could Have Done
If five month sago, this policy of revolutionary war had been adopted by the Soviet masses, by this time – and not “perhaps” in a year – deep fissures would already have appeared in the German home front. The German soldiers would by this time have been in ferment, they would be asking questions, they would be thinking about the future. The ferment in Germany would have raised to fever pitch in the occupied countries. Real help would have been on its way to the embattled Soviet masses, and it would have been the kind that would sweep the Hitlers and Churchills from the face of the earth.
But Stalin’s “substitute” for this powerful weapon has been to place dependence on the “democratic” imperialists. In return for this policy, the Soviet masses have already paid a terrible price they have suffered calamitous blows. Meanwhile Hitler has felt secure in Germany and free to throw all his forces against the workers state.
Events themselves – as well as Churchill’s statement – have shown the bankruptcy of Stalinism. But it is folly to believe that Stalinism will change its course and adopt the revolutionary program. It will continue the cry for a “western front” to come to the rescue of the USSR. It will east about for other panaceas to lull the Soviet masses and confuse the Stalinist rank and file.
 
C.P. Members Warned Not to Speculate
In his Question and Answer column in the Nov. 17 Daily Worker, William Z. Foster tries to answer the question which has been worrying and alarming so many rank and file members of the C.P.: “Can the Soviet Union lick Hitler without outside help?” His answer: “This is an abstract speculative question ... It is not our task to speculate as to whether or not the Soviet Union can beat Hitler alone. Our job is to wake up the American people to a fuller realization that this is their war and that the Red Army is defending the United States as well as the USSR, etc.”
The Stalinist bureaucrats are panic-stricken lest the rank and file begin to think about the fundamental problems involved in the defense of the Soviet Union. The ranks are beginning to ask “abstract speculative questions” not only in the United States, but also in the USSR.
“It is not our task to speculate” shrieks Foster. What he really means is that any worker who begins to ask questions has already taken the first step on the road of understanding that Stalinism is incapable of leading a successful defense of the first workers state.
 



Reports from the Moscow front tell of fierce fighting raging around all the approaches to the capital. A radio broadcast from Moscow on November 3 declared that the German assault on the city had “entered a most serious phase”, with the Germans throwing in fresh reserves of planes, tanks, guns and men. A decisive battle was being fought at the munitions center, Tula, 100 miles south of Moscow; and losses were increasing tremendously on both sides in the battle for Kalinin, 95 miles northwest of Moscow.
Late dispatches also tell of serious defeats for the Soviet forces in the Crimea, where they are reported to have been cut in two and driven back to the coast. Loss of the Crimea will give the Germans not only control of the Black Sea, but places them in a position to outflank Rostov, and the Don basin and threaten the Caucusus and its oil fields.
No one disputes the high fighting calibre, the spirit of sacrifice, the splendid morale of the Red Army soldiers. If the advances of the German armies have been slowed up thus far, it is due primarily to these qualities of the Red Army.
But wars are not won by heroism alone. Modern armies require the proper strategy, the taking into account of all the factors, military, geographical, political, the co-ordination and the effective use of resources at hand, the selection of the weak points in the enemy’s front.
 
Stalin’s Interview with Ingersoll
Stalin’s “strategy” in the war was authoritatively revealed last week in a series of articles written by Ralph Ingersoll for the newspaper PM. Ingersoll has just returned from three weeks in the USSR where he discussed the war with many of the Soviet officials, and was granted an interview with Stalin himself.
On October 31, without quoting Stalin directly, but using the information Stalin gave him during the interview, Ingersoll gave Stalin’s views on the war under the title, What the Soviet Government Thinks About the War.
Stalin’s views, both by what he says and what he leaves unsaid, do more than explain the defeats; they reveal that Stalin intends to continue those policies which resulted in the defeats.
 
Stalin Explains the Initial Defeats
How did Stalin explain the initial and the recent defeats to Ingersoll? By admitting that he did not expect the war with Germany when it came, and was unprepared for it!
The German army struck quickly.
“When the German bombers came over, anti-aircraft crews did not open fire at once. They telephoned to headquarters to ask instructions on what most of them thought was simply a breach of treaty. Before they had time to think twice, their planes were destroyed and their hangars were on fire. The initial German drive on land, after smashing down outlying strong points, went into Russian territory, at 30 to 40 miles an hour.”
In Moscow “the Government thought that such an obvious threat of invasion was simply the prelude to a demand for further treaty concessions.”
“By the time the German panzer divisions had run the limit of their gas supply, Soviet armies on the frontier were encircled and instead of fighting to hold back the German advance, all their energy and ammunition went to get themselves out of the hole they were in and to reforming into a coherent line. Enormous supplies of equipment were lost in this retreat and from then on the Soviet Government knew that its armies would not be able immediately to stem the German advance – even at the old Soviet frontier, which was better fortified than the new.”
In short, the ease of the initial German victories was due primarily to the stupidity of the Kremlin and its belief that Hitler would continue to bargain indefinitely for more “concessions.”
The Germans made rapid advances in the first weeks of the war because Stalin had not prepared the Red Army politically or strategically for what came. Just as. today he places his hopes on some kind of understanding with the “democratic” imperialists, so he placed his hopes before June 22 on the continuation of some kind of understanding with Hitler.
 
Can USSR Defeat Hitler Alone?
Can the Soviet Union defeat Hitler without outside aid, as the Stalinists boasted it could before and even after the beginning of the war?
The Kremlin claims it can no longer. According to what Stalin told Ingersoll, “The Soviet Government knows its armies are now outnumbered in planes and tanks.” It does not even have as its objective the defeat of Hitler’s armies:
“Therefore its optimum objective, in a military sense, is to keep its armies together and to continue its unbroken line of resistance and to go on exacting casualties as it retreats.
“This has been the Soviet strategy since the breakthrough of the first week of the war.”
What a refutation of the lies and boasts spread by the Stalinists early in the war to cover up the lack of a unified strategic plan of victory and to hide Stalin’s responsibility for the defeats! Typical of these boasts was the one advanced by the Stalinists in the Daily Worker of July 5:
“The Hitler mechanized army is meeting with tanks and planes more powerful than his own and with military generalship more skilled and more brilliant than his own staff.”
Stalin no longer makes such boasts. Indeed, as Ingersoll puts it for him:
“The Soviet Government admits that the Germans still have the equipment and the organization to take any given local objective, unless it be one of the big cities which the citizens can turn into a fortress and which can only be taken by complete encirclement and starving-out. Thus it is resigned to the fact that, alone, its armies cannot administer a severe defeat to the Germans in the field. (Emphasis by Ingersoll)”
 
Dangers in Stalin’s Strategy
What can this strategy of “exacting casualties as it retreats” lead to? This process of exacting casualties on the enemy means simultaneous casualties for the Army. And the further the Soviet forces retreat, the more territory embracing the means of vital industrial production falls into the hands of the enemy and all the harder it becomes to hold them at the next stage.
In addition, such a process at a certain point is certain to affect the morale of the Red Army soldiers; a continuous process of defeats is bound to produce doubts and a feeling of futility and impotence; the soldiers will begin to believe, in the face of all these defeats and retreats, that they are fighting in vain.
One of the reasons that Stalin was forced to adopt a “strategy” of retreat was that the Red Army lacked a competent, trained leadership able to work out a strategy that could bring victory. This situation existed because, in the interests of eliminating all criticism and opposition in the armed forces to his bureaucratic regime, Stalin destroyed the flower of the Red Army command in the purges of 1937–38 and appointed in their place nonentities with neither the ability nor experience to lead the Red Army to victory against a powerful foe.
All the facts show that Stalin’s misconduct of the war is not something accidental or the result of misunderstanding on his part of what the situation requires, but is directly linked with and flows from all of his past policies. To fully understand his policies in this war, it is necessary to study and become acquainted with the past policies and history of Stalinism, beginning with the theory of “socialism in one country.”
 
Stalin’s Proposal for Defeating Hitler
Now, 17 years after he promulgated this theory of “socialism in one country” Stalin is forced to admit that the Soviet Union under his leadership will be defeated unless aid comes from the outside.
With the Red Army outnumbered, with the military leadership able to execute only a “strategy” of retreat, the fate of the Soviet Union depends on what happens to the German armies from the rear or within. The question is: How can the German drive be halted, disintegrated from the rear? What is the policy Stalin proposes? Here it is, as given by Ingersoll:
“Based on information from its own agents in Germany and information obtained from captives, the Soviet Government does not believe that collapse of the German State is in order. It has heard talk about an imminent collapse – from its allies – but it believes this is wishful thinking. It thinks German morale is high and that nothing will unseat Hitler except a decisive military defeat.”
But Stalin is resigned to the fact that the Red Army alone cannot defeat the Germans. Since Stalin feels the Red Army cannot defeat Hitler, and since he believes that “nothing but a decisive military defeat” will accomplish this, Stalin declares that some other force will have to do the job of cracking German morale and overthrowing Hitler. Ingersoll continues:
“For the purpose of upsetting the Nazi regime it (the Stalinist regime) does not believe that this defeat need necessarily be administered to his principal armies. It believes the decisive defeat of one of Hitler’s allies could turn the trick.”
But no one could seriously contend that the military defeat of one of Hitler’s allies would seriously interfere with the advance of the German armies in Russia. Ingersoll explains that Stalin looks at it this way:
 
“Principle” Behind the “Western Front”
“Many of those who have joined forces with Hitler – the Rumanians, the Hungarians, the Finns, etc., etc., have done so as the lesser of two evils. It must be demonstrated to at least one of them that their alliance is not the lesser but the far, far greater of the two evils. For this purpose it will not be enough simply to defeat an army allied to Germany in the field; it will be necessary utterly to annihilate the forces of some ally, wholly to destroy its government. To rub its nose in it. To make defeat and collapse so obvious that the news of it will spread over the world, censorship or controlled press or no. (Emphasis by Ingersoll).
“This is the principle behind the Soviet request to Britain for a ‘diversion front’.”
This is the policy on which Stalin now depends to save the Soviet Union in the darkest hour in its history – the policy of a crushing imperialist defeat of one of Hitler’s allies, the complete annihilation of its forces and destruction of its government. This, lie declares, is the only salvation of the Soviet Union, this is the only way to overthrow the Nazi regime!
 
Would This Policy Weaken Hitler?
But if the fate of the Soviet Union really depended upon such a policy, then it would be doomed. The carrying out of such a “western front” will not in the last analysis weaken Hitler’s war, but, on the contrary, in a real sense, it will strengthen it!
Because Hitler will be able to point to his defeated ally, and tell the German people and his other allies: You see what will happen to you if England wins this war? You will be crushed and annihilated, wholly destroyed. To prevent this, to prevent the imposition of another and worse Versailles Treaty which will bring untold suffering and depression to our country and yours, you must exert yourselves even more to insure the defeat of the enemy.
In short, such a policy will only give Hitler another weapon to add to those which he now uses to secure support for his war against the Soviet Union. Its mere advocacy has no doubt been greeted eagerly by Goebbels.
No, the very lesson of the rise of Hitler is that large sections of the masses of Europe are looking for some alternative to the rule of “democratic” imperialism and are temporarily willing to endure all kinds of hardships under Hitlerism in the hope that it may bring them a satisfactory alternative. Hitler’s source of strength lies precisely in his promise that German imperialist victory in the war will bring a “new order”.
 
Still Not Too Late to Save the USSR!
The bankruptcy of Stalinism and the military gains of Hitler so far do not mean that it is too late to save the Soviet Union, even at this late hour.
This is not the first time that imperialism threatened the very existence of the workers state. In 1918-20 the Soviet Union was able to hold off and defeat not only the imperialist intervention but to crush the counter-revolutionary White Guard Russians. The policy of revolutionary war and appealing to the international working class that saved the Soviet Union after World War I can again save it in World War II.
This policy – today embodied in the Trotskyist program for Soviet victory – requires a revolutionary appeal to the masses of Europe and above all Germany. They must be assured that the Soviet Union will fight side by side with them against any new Versailles Treaty, that the Soviet Union will oppose any imperialist peace settlement that will place new burdens on the backs of the exploited masses. The masses can be aroused to revolutionary action and initiative, not by the example of a lesser evil which is really not “lesser” at all, but by a fighting program for the solution of their own problems. The masses of Europe must be shown that there is a real alternative to capitalism, that the solution of their problems lies in the struggle for the Socialist United States of Europe and the world.
 
Strengthen the Front to Defeat Hitler
The program for Soviet victory further requires measures to strengthen the front against Hitler in the Soviet Union at the same time that revolutionary agitation is being used to undermine Hitler’s rear. The release of the brave and able pro-Soviet workers and soldiers, many of whom were leaders in the Civil War, and who are now kept in Stalin’s concentration tamps and prisons only because they opposed the ruinous policies of Stalinism, will provide new leadership at the front. The reconstitution of the democratically - elected Soviets, the legalization of pro-Soviet political parties, will arouse the initiative and enthusiasm of the Soviet workers, soldiers and peasants for they will feel once again that they have something to say about the policies of the workers state.
It is in the light of Stalin’s program for saving the Soviet Union that his “strategy” of retreats assumes a particularly ominous character. Sometimes retreats cannot be avoided, sometimes they are justified. Even the most correct revolutionary strategy can not always guarantee victories, for there are other factors that can be decisive in particular battles and campaigns. But there are retreats and retreats.
The Bolsheviks in the Civil War Days of 1918-20, even though they followed a bold, revolutionary policy, which brought victory in the end, often had to retreat. But when they retreated, it was for the purpose of obtaining a breathing space, with the perspective of revolutionary developments in the rear of the enemy and throughout Europe coming to their aid. But Stalin has no such perspective.
Stalinism has shown by its betrayal of the Bolshevik program of Soviet victory that it is the greatest internal obstacle to the successful defense of the Soviet Union. As its responsibility for the defeats becomes more apparent, as the reasons for its failure to conduct a revolutionary war become more widely understood, the Soviet masses, choosing the proper time, without endangering the front against imperialism, must rid themselves of the Stalinist bureaucracy and march forward with the workers of the world to victory for the Soviet Union and world socialism.
The fight to save the Soviet Union is not the fight of the Soviet masses alone. The workers of the world have a stake in preventing the destruction of the remaining conquests of the October revolution.
The Soviet masses require the assistance of the workers of the world. The task for advanced workers everywhere throughout the capitalist world is to explain the cause of the defeats in the USSR, to show how victory can still be achieved, to help the workers avoid the pitfalls of giving up opposition to the aims of their own ruling class, to strengthen the forces of the world revolution which alone can save the USSR.
 



One of the great achievements of the CIO, among many others, was that it opened its doors wide to Negro workers, and especially the great bulk of them in the mass industries. This resulted not only in a more effective organization of the basic industries, but it also did much to build up a feeling of solidarity among the white and Negro workers and to greatly increase the pro-union sentiment among the Negro people generally.
Since the organization of the CIO, the Negro workers have been integrated into hundreds of local unions. They have attended their meetings in “peace time” as well as done their full share on the picket lines in time of strike. They have been elected as officers and shop stewards and committeemen and responsible leaders in many shops, even where the Negro workers form only a small part of the membership. More and more Negroes have been selected as national organizers and representatives of their union and sent in to organize new fields. On the whole, the Negro workers in the CIO feel that it is their home, and they belong in it.
But it would not be painting a true picture to let it go at that and say that complete and full equality for the Negro people exists in all the shops that have been unionized, even by the CIO.
By this I do not mean to say that it is the policy of the CIO or its affiliated unions to practice discrimination or segregation against its Negro members. Far from it. If in isolated instances in the CIO such Jim Crow practices are discovered, they are the exception to the rule, and should be reported and exposed and fought against, and undoubtedly the CIO national office would aid in such a fight.
But while there are no, or practically no cases of such open discrimination in the CIO, that does not mean that there are no special problems for the Negro members in many situations. For even if the CIO does not discriminate, the employers and their managers still consider the Negro workers as “inferior” and do not hesitate to go out of their way in giving Negroes the dirtiest and lowest paid jobs and in preventing them from advancing to better and skilled positions.
And often the local leaders of the unions just do not see the problem or its importance. They may mean well and might be the first to protest and propose action to correct this situation – but meanwhile, they are so concerned about other problems, they are so busy that they just don’t see this important problem.
Thus, as many Negro workers who have observed this will understand, although the CIO does not practice Jim Crowism, there are special Jim Crow problems which exist which the CIO is not in all cases taking the necessary steps to wipe out.
What is to be done in this situation? It is serious, for as long as it exists, many Negro workers will continue to feel that their white brothers are only paying lip-service to the idea of equality for the Negro workers, and in the end the employers may be able to turn them against the unions.
 

The Answer to the Problem
The answer is that the Negro workers in the unions – AFL as well as CIO – must get together as an organized force within the unions to bring these problems before the other workers and propose steps to correct them. They must organize Negro Labor Councils, or any other name you want to give it, which will concern themselves with the solution of the special problems facing Negro workers.
Does this mean separate unions? No! Does this mean separate Negro locals? No! Does this mean a body set up to fight against the regularly constituted locals in the various shops? No!
It simply means that the Negro workers will get together in their unions and in their cities to discuss how to best protect the interests of the Negro workers in the unions, how to bring unorganized Negroes into the unions, how to develop a more favorable attitude toward the unions among the non-unionized Negroes, and all other measures which will help to build the unions. They will not function separately from the unions, but as a matter of fact will try to get the unions to endorse their work and assist them in it.
Won’t such a step antagonize many white workers? Not at all. As a matter of fact, the white workers will respect the Negroes all the more when they see that they are determined to build the unions and protect their own interests at the same time.
Is this a new idea? There is nothing new about it. For many years such a body of Jewish workers in New York did a very good job in helping to organize Jewish-speaking workers into the unions. There have been various such groups in the history of the American labor movement. Many prominent Negroes have for a long time been advocating the formation of such Councils – not to fight unionism, but to help it.
At the present time such bodies already exist in various parts of the country. Just recently there was organized a Mid-West Negro Labor Council in Chicago, with representation from CIO and AFL unions. (Next week we’ll tell more about it.) In many different local unions such bodies already exist and have done some good work.
What is necessary now is to spread and extend the formation of such Councils everywhere. Negro delegates to the CIO convention in Detroit this week should discuss the matter and bring it before the convention for its approval. Such approval would be a real impetus to formation of these Councils.
 



Negro workers in the metropolitan area will have a chance on Tuesday, November 4, to express their views on the most important questions of the day. On election day in New York City and in Essex County, New Jersey, they will be able by the votes they cast to show where they stand on the vital questions of war, fascism, Jim Crowism, jobs and equal rights for the Negro people, attacks on civil liberties and militant unionism.
What do the Democratic and Republican parties stand for today? Every Negro worker has had the opportunity from his own experience and observation to learn the answer to this question. Not from the answers the Democratic and Republican politicians give to this question around election time, for then they are all honey and sweetness, full of fine promises, ready to give away cigars and hot dogs and beer and to pat babies on the head. I once saw a white wardheeler who despised Negroes pick up a little colored baby and kiss her – ten days before the voting took place.
I mean what do these boss parties really stand for?
Where do they stand on Negro rights? On paper, they say they stand for “fair play” and “equal treatment” and so on. But when it comes to action, these promises are shown to be very hollow indeed.
Take the Anti-Lynch bills, for example. When the Republican Party had a majority in both houses of Congress, it failed to pass this legislation. When the Democratic Party got a majority, it too refused to pass it. And these bills of theirs are very weak and inadequate as it is. When they refuse to pass them, they reveal more about their true attitude toward the Negro people than all the talk and words in the world.
The same thing with the Anti-Poll Tax bills. The same thing with legislation to stop the bosses from barring Negroes from industry. Talk is cheap, but action is what counts.
Of course, there are some politicians who are more dependent on Negro votes than others, and they are more careful in how they act. LaGuardia is a good example. But when it comes to something important, men like LaGuardia only use their reputations as “friends of the Negroes” to hinder and prevent the real struggle against Jim Crowism. Last June, when thousands of Negroes were getting ready for their March on Washington for jobs and equality, LaGuardia used all his influence to prevent them from going through with their militant action which would have accomplished a million times more than all his promises and appointments.
Workers must stop making the mistake of saying, “The boss parties are no good, we know that, but Jones and Smith are good men belonging to those parties, and so we will vote for them.” Politicians must be judged primarily on the basis of the party they belong to, and the program and record of the party they belong to. Candidates of the boss parties must accept the responsibility not only for what they do themselves, but for what their party does.
 

Vote for the Program You Support
Workers must also learn to resist the old argument that it is no use voting for the candidate of a fighting workers party, “because he can’t get elected anyhow, and it would only be wasting your vote to support him.”
If you really want to waste your vote, cast it for the candidates who are opposed to labor’s best interests. What good does it do workers to help elect people who are going to oppose labor’s needs?
What does a vote for the Republican or Democratic party mean? It means a vote in favor of the war and the war program that the masses will have to pay for. It means a vote of approval for their refusal to pass the Anti-Lynch Bill, the Anti-Poll Tax Bill, for their refusal to put any teeth into the order to abolish discrimination in industry. It means a vote of approval of the refusal of both parties to do anything about the vicious Jim Crow system in the Army and Navy.
And what will you be voting for when you support the Socialist Workers Party? First of all, you will be saying that you are opposed to this fake “war for democracy”. Secondly, you will be saying that you are opposed to fascism both at home and abroad, and you recognize that the workers themselves, independently of the bosses, must organize their forces to defeat fascism and destroy its roots.
You will be saying that you are opposed to Jim Crowism in any form and in any place. You will be saying that you are ready to fight for full social, economic and political equality for the Negro people. You will be saying that you are opposed to the capitalist system that breeds racial prejudices to keep the workers divided so that the bosses can exploit them more easily, and that you want to replace it with a system where discrimination will be forever abolished, where all workers will have security and freedom.
In New York our candidate for mayor is James P. Cannon. In Essex County our candidate for General Assembly is George Breitman. They merit the support of every Negro and white worker not only because of the struggles they have led and participated in, but primarily because the program they represent is the only answer to the problems of the working class.
 




[Ford Failure]
The biggest thing about the Ford strike was the miserable failure of Ford, Bennett and Marshall to preserve the open shop by provoking a race riot between the Negro and white workers. The fact stands out, big and proud, that the overwhelming majority of the 12,000 Negro workers in the plant, in spite of a barrage of anti-union, pro-Ford threats and promises, went with their class.
Ford found that, he could not use the Negro workers to break the strike, for a good 80% or more of them saw through his trick, resisted the pressure of many of their “leaders” and went out with the union.
In order to preserve the remnants of this vicious plan, that would have put back the cause of the Negro workers for many years, Ford and his assistants had to depend on a comparatively small number of Negroes who were brought into the plant during the last month from the South. These Negroes, not at all acquainted with what was going on, never having had the opportunity to hear the arguments of the union, in no way familiar with Ford’s anti-union, anti-Negro scheme, were all he had to depend on when the strike actually began.
The other Negroes, the workers who have suffered under the Ford speed-up, spy system and low wage rate for many years – the real Ford Negro workers – knew where their best interests lay: with the union.
So although Ford did have a small group of Negroes to use for his scheme, and he certainly did use them in every way he could, he could not break the strike, nor arouse a spirit of white chauvinism in the union members. Everyone involved in the situation could see that the great bulk of the Negro workers were fighting with the union, not against it.
Incidentally, those Negroes who fell for and helped to spread the pro-Ford propaganda before the strike, must have felt pretty cheap to see how Ford and the boss press consciously directed so much of their publicity toward making it appear that the strike was a race conflict, rather than a struggle of workers of all races for improved working conditions.
The Negro Ford workers did their full share in saving the day for the union at Ford’s. It is up to the white workers in the labor movement now to recognize that they need the full support of the Negroes in the coming struggles and to raise high on their banners the demand for full equality for their colored brothers.
 

The Crummiest Speech
The distinction of having made the worst speech of the year this far belongs to the president of Tuskegee Institute, F.D. Patterson, who declared before the National Congress of Colored Parents and Teachers:
“We are asking for a lot of things that are not of immediate importance though they aim at noteworthy ideals. One that is of apparent import to a lot of people is that we should be integrated in companies and regiments with white soldiers, claiming that the discrimination of the nation’s soldiers on the grounds of color and race is a breach of democratic procedure.
“All that is admirable, but what we should be concerned with at the moment is an opportunity to serve in any capacity ...
“We should stop fretting too much about discrimination, and focus our attention on getting an opportunity on a basis of equality.”
He isn’t aroused about the Negro soldiers being placed in separate regiments where they can be more easily used as suicide squads and as labor battalions.
That’s what he’s doing – serving “in any capacity.” Nothing too low or foul for Patterson.
 

Discrimination Legislation
Recently two bills pertaining to discrimination against Negroes in employment were passed. One, in New York, amends the civil rights law and penal law to “make it unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation engaged to any extent whatsoever in the production, manufacture or distribution of military or naval material, equipment or supplies for the state of New York or for the federal government to refuse to employ any person in any capacity on account of the race, color or creed of such persons.” This measure is now awaiting the signature of the governor ...
The other bill, already signed by the governor and now a law, was passed by the Kansas Legislature. It prohibits any labor union in the state from being certified as a bargaining agency if it “discriminates against, bars or excludes from its membership any person because of race or color.”
It is not hard to make predictions about these bills. The New York bill will be signed and made a law too. But it won’t mean a thing so far as getting jobs for the Negroes. The employers will just stop saying they refuse to hire Negroes; they will just not hire them. And the Negro people will still have to continue their struggle to force open the doors oof industry.
The Kansas law also will not help the Negroes. It will not change the attitude of those reactionary AFL union leaders who now bar them from admission to unions. All it will do is enable the employers, who are really responsible for the lily-white ideas of their labor agents, to divert attention from their refusal to hire Negroes. And it will offer a handle to employers to attack and break up unions.
 




An Urgent Appeal
The National Negro Department of the Socialist Workers Party is working at the present time, in conjunction with Pioneer Publishers, on a program of publications relating to problems of the Negro people.
We are sure that readers of The Militant who have displayed an interest in the articles on these questions printed in this paper will be interested in their speedy publication. One of the pamphlets now in preparation deals with the struggle to break down the Jim Crow bars against Negroes entering into the all-inclusive war industries in skilled and semi-skilled jobs.
Another, already completed and ready to go to press, is a revised version of the series of articles just concluded in this paper, The Negro and The U.S. Army, by Eugene Varlin. The revision of this excellent series of articles brings it up to date, explaining the present situation of the Negro in the armed forces.
The third pamphlet, which will be a long work, is a basic discussion of the Negro struggle, analyzing the situation from all angles and presenting the program of the Socialist Workers Party for the Negro struggle for equality.
These pamphlets, which will be of great help to workers who want an all-sided picture of the problems and needs of the Negro masses, will be ready for distribution as soon as we have the necessary money to bring them off the press. We are therefore making an appeal to all our readers to help us in this ambitious enterprise. We ask for contributions, and we ask for them as soon as possible. Readers who can give us $10.00 and readers who are able to donate only 25 cents – please help us get out this badly needed literature. Send all donations to this column, 116 University Pl., New York City.
 

Repeating 1917
The war may not have taken exactly the same course this time as it did during 1914–1918, but the treatment of the Negro in the armed forces is so exactly the same that one might think the bureaucrats in control of the army were simply reading a history of what happened then and applying it today.
For example, there is the treatment of conscientious objectors.
Charles H. Houston, former Lieutenant of the 368th U.S. Infantry Regiment, in his series of articles called Saving The World For ‘Democracy’, which were printed in The Pittsburgh Courier last year, recalled the following about 1917:
“There was one outstanding exception to the general pattern of segregation at Camp Meade (Maryland): white conscientious objectors were housed with Negro conscientious objectors in a barracks in the 368th Infantry area with an armed white guard over them.
“It must be remembered that the Army considered conscientious objectors as cowards and scum. In the case of white conscientious objectors at Camp Meade the camp command considered them too low to associate with the white soldiers; so it housed them with Negroes and stuck them in a Negro regimental area.
“The Army considered the white officers of our own regiment too good to share the same quarters or even live in the same area with us, their fellow Negro officers, but it could think of no greater degradation for white conscientious objectors than to house them with Negroes in a Negro regimental area.”
* * *
And now, in 1941, comes an announcement from Washington, via Major Campbell Johnson of the Selective Service Board, that there will be “no separate Negro camps for conscientious objectors” and that the camps being set up will serve for all objectors, Negro as well as white.
* * *
The most brazen statement of any boss receiving contracts from the federal government was the one made last week by J.H. Kindelberger, president and general manager of North American Aviation, Inc.:
“Applications for jobs in the plant, where we will employ upward of ten thousand persons, will be received at the temporary Kansas City offices in the near future. We will receive applications from both white and Negro workers! However, the Negroes will be considered only as janitors and in other similar capacities ... While we are in complete sympathy with the Negro, it is against the company policy to employ them as mechanics or aircraft workers. We use none except white workers in the plant in Inglewood (California) and the plant in Dallas (Texas) and we intend to maintain the same policy in Kansas City. There will be some jobs as janitors for Negroes. Regardless of their training as aircraft workers, we will not employ them in the North American plant.”
You can imagine what the attitude of this company toward the Negro would be if it were not “in complete sympathy with the Negro”!
* * *
That the New York State Employment Service helps the bosses in discriminating against Negroes, Jews and Catholics was admitted by a spokesman of the Service in a discussion of the employment application blanks on which “Personal Description” is followed by several initials: “S M W – W N O – C P J,” meaning “Single, Married, Widower; White, Negro, Oriental; Catholic, Protestant, Jew.”
The spokesman tried to clear the Service of responsibility by saying: “It’s entirely the employers’ fault. You can’t legislate discrimination out of existence.”
It is true that it’s the employers’ fault, for it is they who want to know this information so they can discriminate. But that doesn’t excuse the Service for helping them!
 




Pickens Gets the Booby Prize
The most disgusting article of the month by any Negro was the one by William Pickens in his column for A.N.P. Views of the News.
In it Pickens complains that during a recent speech someone in the audience asked a question, trying to discover how he explained the fact that the most outspoken enemies of the Negro people, the Southern Congressmen in Washington, were like himself violently in favor of the passage of the Lend-Lease Bill.
Pickens attempts to dodge the question by poking names and jibes at the person who asked the question. This is easy to do, for it is true, as Pickens says, that because your enemy stands for one thing, you do not necessarily and automatically stand for the opposite.
But still, when your enemy says the same thing as you about something that concerns your fate, it is necessary to stop and think about it and figure out why. Maybe he is wrong in taking that position – and on the other hand, maybe you are.
But Pickens does not do this. Instead, in order to justify his stand, he launches into a defense of the Jim-Crow, poll-tax, lynch-mob lovers who sit in Congress as representatives of the South! He says:
“Without the almost solid South behind our defense movements, the President would never have been able to make any progress with that movement. The southerners are Americans, and it happens to be thai they are American next to the Negro American himself. The rest of the country is largely European and of other more recent foreign origins ... The southerner is a much older American, on the whole, than are the whites of the rest of the land.
“When it comes to an international problem, the southern whites and the blacks, if they use their heads instead of their gall bladders, are most apt to agree together. In defense of America the Negro, when he thinks, will be second to nobody, and the whites of Texas and South Carolina will be second to no white people. There is no great room for differences; the southern whites want to keep their national freedom and their rights – even their rights to keep trying to keep the Negro down. And the Negro wants to keep his American rights – his rights to fight like the devil against being kept down. Under Hitler or any foreigner, both of these Americans would lose their good American rights – for the foreigner would keep BOTH of us down – white and black. “
What does all this blather of Pickens mean? This garbage about the Southern Negro haters being the best Americans? This bosses’ argument about the Northern and Western workers, who hate war, being of “more recent foreign origins, “ being aliens and so on? This fear that the Southern ruling class that oppresses the Negro people may lose its rights to oppress them? This false posing of the problem that if you are opposed to helping England win the war to control the 450,000,000 colored people now under its heel, you are automatically in favor of having Hitler win it?
It means that Pickens is so bankrupt in his politics and his defense of the war plans of the Roosevelt government that he has to throw overboard everything he has been saying for the last 25 years. There is no other way to account for his defense of the Southern Bourbons and his veiled attacks on the progressive workers in the North. And there is no better example of our contention, that you cannot at the same time logically be for the war and against the institutions which the war is intended to preserve. Only those who oppose the war can effectively fight for full equality for the colored people.
In the last six months Pickens has written far more words in defense of the war plans of the government than he has written against the Jim Crow system the government upholds, he has written far more against Hitler than he has written against Bilbo.
And he is the man whom so many people, just a few months ago, were pushing forward to receive the Spingarn medal for having contributed more than any other for the advancement of the Negro people!
In his article, Pickens attempts to, deride the person who asked him the question by telling the story that
“Booker T. Washington used to tell about the old colored man’s politics in ‘Reconstruction’ days: The old man would go down to the town square, before election times, and lean against the telegraph poles and listen slyly to the talk of the white people, to hear how they intended to vote, and when asked about that interest, he explained it thusly: ‘Well, you see, I’m tryin’ to find out how I must vote, and when I learn how the white folks is goin’ to vote, I know that I must vote agin’ it.’ “
Pickens tells ‘the story, not only to sneer at his questioner, but also to sneer at the old man in the story, who doesn’t have his education and his standing as a “leader. “
But the old man, in my opinion, had a better grasp of politics, instinctive as it was, in his left foot than Pickens had in his whole body.
 



Newark’s 45,000 colored people represent one-tenth of the city’s population. In every sense, they are the most exploited and oppressed people in the city.
They are locked out of most of the big industries, forced to serve as janitors or porters or as domestic workers. Only in some of the steel and allied factories are they hired; and then almost exclusively as laborers, doing the heavy and dirty work.
The big corporation, Public Service, which milks the public out of millions each year, refuses to hire them except in menial jobs such as cleaning toilets or digging ditches.
The Brewster Aircraft plant of Part Newark, invited here by the City Commission under very favorable tax and rent terms, refuses to hire a single colored laborer. Prudential insurance company, one of the biggest in the world, which gets millions from its colored clients, will not hire any.
Consequently, a large part of the colored people are forced onto the relief rolls, or, if they are a little more lucky, onto WPA jobs, at standards which make it practically impossible for them to bring their families up under healthy conditions. This explains why the ’flu and pneumonia epidemics each year start sooner and are more malignant in the colored neighborhoods than elsewhere.
 
City Hall No Better
The overwhelming majority of the city departments, although they are supposed to be conducted under civil service, maneuver to have only one or two, or no colored employees at all.
The City Hospital refuses to employ a single Negro doctor or nurse, although many are eligible and one fourth of the hospital’s patients are colored.
Thus the City Commission itself, including tire representatives of the Ellenstein-Franklin and the Byrne-Clee factions, help to propagate the theory of “white superiority,” and furnish the employers with an example of job Jim Crowism which the bosses are only too glad to point to and follow.
 
Critical
A survey of housing in Newark’s Third Ward three years ago brought to light a few of the facts on housing in those neighborhoods to which the colored workers have been segregated and from which it is so hard for them to escape.
Out of 2,010 homes that were inspected, it was found that 1,874 showed violations of the sanitary code. In addition, about 300 were declared to be “unfit for use,” about 800 were said to “need major repairs,” and close to 800 others were in need of “minor repairs.”
And yet the Department of Health, run by Commissioner Franklin who is desperately seeking the Negro vote, declared:
“Economic conditions have persuaded this department to be somewhat lenient with the owners of the buildings insofar as ordering drastic alterations and improvements are concerned ... To overburden these property owners with expensive alterations is not a solution to the problem.”
In other words, Franklin, the self-advertised “champion of the underprivileged,” is really champion DECEIVER of the underprivileged, and “lenient” friend of the landlords who charge such high rents for unhealthy fire-traps maintained in open violation of the sanitary and building codes.
 
Vicious Inequalities
The colored workers’ economic problems are directly tied up with the problems of social equality. There can never be real economic equality for them as long as they are not permitted into certain places like others, for the Jim Crow bars in public places do their share in contributing to the idea that Negroes are inferior, which is used as the basis for denying them equal opportunity to jobs, relief, housing, etc.
A vicious Mason-Dixon line running through Newark confines the colored people to one or two areas. And even inside these areas they face insult and segregation every day in the year.
Just a few weeks ago five colored women went into the luncheonette owned by one Max Grundfast on the edge of the Third Ward. He demanded 40c for a cup of coffee, and then physically threw them out of the place, setting his dog and his son on them. Last week a man who tried to get a drink in a tavern in the same area was beaten up and thrown in jail under $1,000 bail. Theatres in this area refuse to permit Negroes to sit in the orchestra, selling tickets to them, only for the balcony, in violation of the weak New Jersey Civil Rights Act.

Mass Action Against Jim Crow
The N.A.A.C.P. picket lines “before the gates of industrial plants holding government defense contracts and refusing to hire colored workers,” scheduled to be held in 50 key cities on Saturday morning, April 26, with an estimated minimum of 33,000 people participating, is a step to be welcomed and supported.
The business of lobbying and waiting in government chambers hat in hand, and writing to Congressmen and the President, cannot do much toward breaking down the bars of industrial Jim Crowism. Talk is necessary, but it must be supplemented by action. The bosses read letters, and telegrams, the government departments meet with committees of 10 or 15 people – but it takes mass demonstrations involving thousands to show them that the Negro workers are not merely asking for their rights, they are DEMANDING them.
It is also gratifying to learn that A. Philip Randolph, head of the Pullman Porters Union, has not only called for, a march of 10,000 Negroes on Washington, but is also going ahead with plans to organize it.
Charley Cherokee of the Chicago Defender states that Randolph is “quietly” going ahead with his plans for the march. We doubt that “quiet” preparations will actually mobilize the Negro masses into action. What is required is a conference of militant Negro organizations to organize and conduct the affair. We don’t doubt that Randolph is seriously interested in making the march a successful turnout of the resentment of the Negro people, but we find it hard to believe that any one man, even one with the support which Randolph undoubtedly has, can by himself’ carry out the job.
 

Read Your Own Paper!
Horace Cayton, labor editor of the Pittsburgh Courier, this week struck out at those “race leaders” responsible for the Ford, situation, “which so nearly spelt the doom for Negroes in the new labor movement.” He says:
“These ‘race men’ should be smoked out and made to take a position. There is no middle ground. In Detroit the Negro community, depending for employment on the automobile industry, must determine its attitude toward organized labor – no community organization can be impartial – they are either for or against ...”
We would suggest that Cayton read the Detroit edition of his paper, and an article from Detroit in the current issue of all its editions, written by John R. Williams, who says: “Both Mr. Marshall (Ford’s hatchet man) and Mr. Patterson (UAW organizer), along with thousands of other’s, have, congratulated The Courier for its impartial presentation of these issues ...”
The Courier too might have improved the situation which so nearly spelt the doom for Negroes in the new labor movement, if it had been less “impartial.” Cayton is right in saying there is no middle ground. If you weren’t with the union, then you weren’t with the best interests of the Negro workers. The workers needed support, not impartiality.
 

Negroes and the Mediation Board
The Chicago Defender, in commenting on the makeup of the National Mediation Board, deplores the appointment of George Harrison, head of the lily-white Brotherhood of Railway Clerks, who is well known for his anti-Negro bias, and the failure of Roosevelt to appoint a Negro to the Board even though the Negro people constitute one tenth of our population and a much greater proportion of the working class.
“Under the circumstances,” say the Defender, “Negroes must abandon all hopes of being beneficiaries of impartial judgment, unless the administration cancels the Harrison appointment and substitutes a black man in his place.”
This is posing the question incorrectly. Certainly the Negro workers (and the white workers too) should rid themselves of illusions that they will get “impartial judgment” from this Board. They wont get it because there is no such thing. Either you are for the workers, or you are for the bosses.
The appointment of Harrison does serve to show how little Roosevelt considers the interests of the Negro workers. But his recall and the appointment of a Negro on the Board would not change the fundamental fact tht the Negro, like the labor representatives, would only serve as fig-leaf covering to the anti-labor, anti-Negro role of the Mediation Board.
Instead of calling for the appointment of a Negro to the Board, the Negro press should join The Militant in calling for the resignation of all the labor representatives from the Board and in telling them that their place is with the workers, Negro and white, on the picket lines.

Jim Crow Squadron Boycotted
In spite of all efforts to make the Jim Crow Air Corps Squadron at Tuskegee seem appetizing to the Negro people, there has been a definite boycott against the segregated set-up handed down front Washington to quiet the protests about discrimination.
The Associated Negro Press called on the colored newspapers to feature stories about the opportunities that lay in store for young men who want to fly.
The Pittsburgh Courier ran an announcement on its editorial page. Mrs. Roosevelt had pictures of herself taken and printed in the Negro press, showing her preparing to go up in a plane with a Negro pilot.
And in spite of this high pressure drive, the ridiculously low figure of applicants permitted into the squadron has still not been filled. Qualified young men don’t like a Jim Crow squadron.
 



Every colored worker acquainted with what goes on in Newark’s City Hall knows that he has no friends there. That is why every time elections come around, there is a rumbling among the masses, and the beginning of organization to oppose the City Hall machines and to elect an independent colored candidate as Commissioner.
It is always at this point that the so-called colored “leaders” jump into the picture and try to head off or break up an independent colored political movement.
Early in this campaign several Negroes announced their candidacy. The different colored organizations began to stress the necessity of fighting for the election of a colored Commissioner. Talk began to spread about uniting the different groups behind one candidate by holding a city-wide conference representative of the organizations.
Then the lawyers and doctors and wardheelers stepped in.
Holding one or two conferences representative only of themselves, and supported by the colored press they decided to push the candidacy of Rev. William P. Hayes, a safe and sane conservative whose only role in political life has been to oppose the $21,000,000 relief referendum of 1929 at a time when defeat of the measure would have meant starvation for thousands.
Hayes, said these leaders, would antagonize no one, and so everyone would get behind him. None of the City Hall factions would oppose him (because he wouldn’t oppose them). So all the colored ward heelers could support him at the same time they supported their individual factions. The fact that Hayes did not stand for any particular program, they said, was in his favor.
And so all the other colored candidates, and all the working class candidates were ignored and their campaigns played down, while Hayes was built up by the colored press.
This went on until about two weeks ago when Hayes left them holding the bag by declaring that he was too busy in the church (he felt he couldn’t win anyway, so why run?).
Immediately, these “leaders” scattered to the wind, dropping the idea of a campaign for an independent colored candidate like a hot stone and scurried off to offer their services to the various boss political machines.
And so we see the strange picture of the so-called leaders of the colored race deserting the movement to place a colored man on the Commission and flocking to the aid of the politicians who have kicked the Negroes around for so many years.
And we see the strange picture of the colored press, which claims to be the voice of the colored race and which a month ago printed long editorials on the need of securing colored representation on the Commission, now filling its columns with article after article on the lily-white politicians and printing virtually nothing on the colored candidates, even when something significant occurs on their campaign.
The two outstanding colored candidates are William E. Bohannan and Dr. Andrew V. Morris.
Bohannan is a trade unionist and member of the CIO, endorsed by some unions and running on the working class slogan of “Make Newark a 100% Union Town.” His campaign is important because it illustrates that a colored candidate can get support of white workers if he presents a platform in their interests as well as in the interests of the colored workers.
 
CIO Endorses His Bills
As an example of this, one an point not only to endorsement of Bohannan by unions of white and colored workers, but also to the action by the Greater Newark Industrial Union Council, central CIO body, just last week when this powerful body of white and colored workers voted to endorse the two “Bohannan Equal Rights Bills” to punish discrimination against Negroes in employment by companies dealing with the city and by proprietors of public places.
A few examples from the press will illustrate the hopelessness of expecting any independent leader ship from them in this campaign:

In February, Editor Clark of the Guardian assailed Vincent Murphy, at present Commissioner, for not doing anything for the colored people who had supported him as “labor’s choice” four years ago, and warning him he need not expect their support in this campaign, even if he had just hired a second colored employee. In March, Murphy bought some space in the Guardian. Early in April there was an account of a meeting on behalf of Murphy and listed among the speakers was none other than Editor Clark!
 
The Herald News fully supported the move to draft Hayes because of the terrible conditions among the Negroes these last four years. Yet it supports the candidacy of Ellenstein, Franklin and Murphy who constituted a majority of the Commission in office these last four years!
 
The Afro-American has long demanded the admission of colored doctors and nurses to the City Hospital. Yet it today supports the candidacy of Franklin, head of the department which bars them.

 



NEWARK, N.J. – Two years ago this month the Newark relief administration succeeded in putting, through the plan it had been working on so long – the barring of unemployed organizations from the relief stations of the city.
But with the passage of the ruling that “every relief client must speak for himself,” the Franklin-Malady relief administration began a series of cuts which have reduced the rolls to half the number, of two years ago, and wiped out every one of the gains won in the eight years previous to that.
 
Relief Today
The period of waiting after application for relief is now from three to four weeks, often more, where previously it was a week or so. The special “emergency check” is now a thing of the past.
Special diets, which were granted on any doctor’s recommendation, thus providing more food for sick people, are granted in only 1% of the cases which had them previously. No longer is the recommendation of any doctor sufficient: only a city doctor’s word is good enough now.
Where previously as much as a quart of milk was allowed for children below 12 years of age, today half-a-quart is considered quite sufficient by relief officials. Relief granted to strikers was always of great help to unions of newly organized workers with little finances to run their strikes. Today strikers are not allowed relief.
 
Condemned to Freeze
In 1939, the department began to issue coal for the winter season in October. In 1940, “money was saved” by not issuing the coal until the middle of December. During this period a wave of influenza and pneumonia cases reached almost the proportions of an epidemic in the workers’ neighborhoods.
Previously, by exerting a lot of pressure a relief client could get an order for clothing that could be cashed in a clothing stored Now this has been done away with. Relief clients get only clothing made on the WPA projects, and extremely little of that. In 1940 less than 1c per day per person was spent by the city on clothing. The 1941 budget calls for about the same figure.
But the best example of all of how Newark relief is conducted, now that the unemployed unions are locked out, is the recent ruling on rental allowances. In 1939 they were as follows: $15 a month for families of six or less, and up to $20 a month in certain cases of larger families. Gradually this was cut down so that single people received only $12 a month, and small families received even less than $15.
Suddenly last month the following policy was announced in a newspaper announcement headed: “Relief Clients’ Landlords May Get Increased Rents”:
Families of one or two were to receive a maximum of $9 a month, families of three and four to receive maximum of $10.50 and $13.50. But families of over five would receive more than $15. This was the “increase” talked about.
 
The Way Out
The key to the relief problem does not lie in the promises made by the politicians prior to elections. Franklin, self-proclaimed “champion of the underprivileged” will be able to do everything he wants, as long as the unemployed are not organized into unions that are recognized and have the right to bargain for their members.
That is why in this election we say to the unemployed that what they must fight for is recognition of their committees. The present administration, in spite of its claims that it is “fair to labor,” has shown that it is not fair to unions of the unemployed. That is why we say that the workers need a City Commission controlled by and responsible to the workers, which will recognize this right and open up the way to an improvement in relief standards.
LET LABOR CONTROL THE CITY COMMISSION! Build a labor party and elect a City Commission that is pledged, among other things, to recognition of the unemployed unions!
 



In an interesting series of articles in The Pittsburgh Courier, W. Robert Ming, Jr., Professor in the School of Law at Howard University, has dealt with the legal and technical aspects of the case of the S.S. Philadelphia sailors who were kicked out of the U.S. Navy because they signed a letter protesting intolerable Jim Crow conditions.
After demonstrating that the Philadelphia case shows how freedom of speech has been stolen from those in the Army and Navy, Professor Ming goes on to point out how much power this puts in the hands of the “brass hats.” If the public outside can’t get information about conditions in the armed forces from the only possible source – that is, from those inside – how can it possibly do anything to correct or improve those conditions? This means that if the soldiers can’t speak about conditions to the public, the officer caste can do just about anything it wants.
Professor Ming goes on to show that the officer caste has still another weapon to keep the mouths of conscripted soldiers shut, in addition to the power to discharge those who speak up. The right (“ephemeral though it be”) of a conscript to his former job depends on his getting a certificate from the Army “indicating satisfactory completion of the training course.” Under the present conscription set-up, a worker who would protest to the world outside, would certainly not get such a certificate. “This possibility of dual punishment places in the hands of the officers of this great peace-time army tremendous power without adequate controls and safeguards for the protection of the selectees.”
 

Where the Criticism Falls Down
But these articles in the Pittsburgh Courier are at their weakest point when the writer attempts to indicate how full rights for Negroes may be obtained and the right of freedom of speech and other civil liberties restored. For in his discussion of this, which is the key question, he limits himself to legal procedure and ignores the actual character of the courts and other institutions of the government.
How is the power of the officer caste to be limited? Operating under the Articles of War, they do just what they please, replying to criticism from the ranks with arrests and discharges, and to criticism from the outside with haughty contempt (the Philadelphia mess attendants were kicked out “in the best interests” of the Navy and themselves, says Rear Admiral Nimitz).
Says Professor Ming: “Practical solution of this problem created by the conflict between Army regimentation and civil liberty is possible. One simple device to secure the desired end would be to provide for review by civil courts, of actions by court martials or punishments inflicted on members of the armed forces by officers ...”
What are these civil courts anyhow? Fair and impartial; or the instrument of the ruling capitalist class? If Professor Ming doesn’t know from his own personal experience, let him ask workers who have been out on strike. Let him ask a poor man who has tried to sue a rich corporation. Or let him look up the decisions of the courts with regard to the Negro people, the courts’ approval of segregation in education and on trolley cars, their approval of the poll tax and the white , primary laws and the other legislation aimed at maintaining “white supremacy.”
If we consider here not the words about “justice” that are written into the laws, but really understand how they work, then we can understand that workers in the armed forces, colored or white, would get no better treatment from the civil courts than they do from the military. In fact, the consistent refusal of the civil courts to interfere with military decisions, is proof that they approve segregation, discrimination and denial of freedom of speech as practiced by the officer caste, and don’t want to interfere with it.
If you really want to abolish Jim Crowism, if you really want to protect the rights and improve the conditions of the soldiers and sailors, there can be no half-way measures: the officers will either have the power to do what they want, or they won’t. Either you go the whole hog and take control of military training away from the officer caste completely – or you waste your time and bat your head against a stone wall. Any program which falls short of military training under control of the workers themselves is one which leaves the reactionary officers with full power, and is therefore completely ineffective and useless.
 

A Correction
In our pamphlet on the Philadelphia men, issued before their discharge, we feared because of the silence that surrounded the case that the boys would be framed-up in a court martial. We said, “The court martial, when it takes place, will be conducted behind closed doors. (The men) will not be permitted to use lawyers from the outside ...”
According to Professor Ming, however, this is not legally correct. His explanation not only clears up this point, but shows why the boys escaped court martial and even worse punishment than they received.
“Public opinion was aroused (after news of the arrests leaked out) ... You know what the Navy did in the face of this public outcry. They turned down the recommendation (of court martial) of the captain of the Philadelphia. That was dangerous – if these men had been subjected to a general court martial they would have been entitled to the assistance of outside counsel, and a public hearing, a statement of charges, and the other protections which our legal system has devised for the safeguard of the defendants, even if they are members of the armed forces.
“Instead the ‘brass hats’ decided that these men should be discharged from the Navy – not ‘honorably’ ... but rather, they were to be given ‘undesirable discharges’.”/p>

 




Lenin and the Negroes
Those who are interested in the struggle of the Negro people for full equality have special reason to remember Lenin on this anniversary of his death.
For Lenin, more than any other man of our time, contributed toward an understanding and solution of the problems facing the Negro people. And his contributions were not only in a general sense, but in a specific sense as well; not only on a national, but on a world scale: not only in the sphere of general politics, but in the internal sphere of the revolutionary movement.
It is the general program of Leninism which will guide the workers, colored and white, to their victory over the capitalist system and put an end to its wars, fascism, unemployment, racial discrimination. Lenin taught that the workers must take power away from the bosses: take away their power to hire and fire, their power to control the factories and discriminate against Negroes in hiring and classification of work; take away their control of the armed, forces through their mercenary hirelings, the officer caste, whom they train to Jim Crow the Negro; take away their control of the press, the schools, the church, the movies, all of which they use to perpetuate the system of “white supremacy,” and thus keep white and colored workers divided and the bosses in power.
Workers, said Lenin, take power into your own hands. Set up your own government, run it yourselves, in your own interests. That is the only way to do away with war, unemployment, racial and national divisions.
And the Soviet Union of Lenin’s time showed that this was true, that it was only under workers’ power that the many different racial and national groups of that country could live together in peace and equality.
Lenin’s greatest contribution in this field was in connection with the colonial and national question, that is, the solution of the world Negro problem.
 

What Lenin Taught Us
In his famous theses on this task, adopted at the Second Congress of the Third International, he analysed the failure of the radical movements of the past to understand this problem. “The Second International failed to appreciate the importance of the colonial question. For them, the world did not exist outside of Europe. They could not see the necessity of co-ordinating the revolutionary movement of Europe with those in the. non-European countries. Instead of giving moral and material help to the revolutionary movement in the colonies, the members of the Second International themselves became imperialists.
Lenin, pointed out that as long as the capitalists in the imperialist countries could squeeze and bleed super-profits out of the natives in the colonies, they would be strong enough at home to resist the workers and remain in power and that, consequently, the workers in these advanced countries must help and strengthen the struggles of the colonies against their joint enemy and oppressor, the imperialists.
It was Lenin’s teachings, therefore, which developed the comradely attitude of the revolutionary workers toward the millions of oppressed colored peoples throughout the world, and made them understand the necessity of assisting in every way the struggle of the colored peoples for independence.
 

Stalin and the Negroes
The Communist International, which has degenerated under Stalin from the vanguard of the revolution to the watchdog of the bureaucrats in the Kremlin, still pretends to honor the memory and carry out the teachings of Lenin. There is no better yardstick for measuring the hypocrisy of the Stalinists than contrasting their practice on the colonial question with Lenin’s teachings.
During the period 1935–39, when they were wooing the democratic imperialists to get a pact with Stalin, they dropped the colonial peoples overboard. “Instead of giving moral and material help”, they ignored or sabotaged the struggles in the colonies, because they wanted to get the good will of the capitalists who oppress these colonies. In the quotation above, Lenin used the strongest terms in denouncing the Second International for doing this. We can be sure that his language would have been no more gentle about Stalin’s shipping of oil to Italy during the invasion of Ethiopia.
 

For All Races!
Just as Lenin clarified the attitude of the revolutionary movement toward the colonial people, so did he revolutionize its attitude toward the colored people in the capitalist countries. Here is what he said on it in the Statutes, adopted by the Communist International’s Second Congress.
“The Communist International once forever breaks with the traditions of the Second International which in reality only recognized the white race. The Communist International makes it its task to emancipate the workers of the entire world. The ranks of the Communist International fraternally unites men of all colors: white, yellow, and black – the toilers of the entire world.”
This was of especial significance for us here in the United States, where the Negro people, who form so large a proportion of the exploited population, had been completely overlooked or only formally recognized in the propaganda and organizational work of the Socialist Party, in much the same way that its parent body, the Second International, had, treated the colonial question.
It is necessary to support the movement for real equality among the American Negroes, Lenin pointed out in the theses on the colonial question, and thereby he opened the eyes of the American revolutionists to the unbreakable connection between the struggle of the Negroes for equality and the struggle for the social revolution./p>

 




[Double Thanks]
The aircraft workers at Vultee (organized into Local 683 of the United Auto Workers Union, CIO) deserve double thanks from the workers of this country.
First of all they struck a blow which showed that it is not only desirable but possible to win higher wages and better working conditions in the war industries, even under a heavy barrage of attacks from the employers, their stooges and the government.
Secondly, they have taken another action which will be greeted with enthusiasm by the workers, especially those Negro workers who are almost 100% barred from many important industries such as aircraft.
Here is how it happened. At the dance celebrating the victorious strike, two Negro members were asked to leave by people acting as floor managers and making the request on their own initiative.
When the members of the union learned about it, there was a discussion of this action on the floor of a regular local meeting, resulting in the adoption of the following resolution:
“WHEREAS: At a public dance given by the Vultee unit of Local 683, two Negro union brothers and their guests were asked to leave, and
WHEREAS: This action is in direct contradiction to the national CIO policy of no discrimination because of race, color, creed, nationality or political affiliation, and
WHEREAS: The success of our drive to organize the aircraft industry depends upon the broadest possible public support, and
WHEREAS: The Negro people, who helped on our picket line with donations of food and money in our recent successful strike, are part of that public, and
WHEREAS: We recognize that discrimination of any kind is the weapon used by the employer and his organizations to split and divide us in our struggle for a higher standard of living, therefore be it
RESOLVED: That we apologize to the Negro people for this action, and that we give our complete assurance that this action will not be repeated, and be it further
RESOLVED: That this Local 683 of the United Auto Workers, CIO, do all in its power to break down the anti-labor, racial discrimination policy in the aircraft and national defense industries, recognizing that our national defense must rest on the maintenance of our democratic principles, foremost among which is the right of every citizen to an opportunity to earn his livelihood without discrimination.”
Another instance of gains in the field of labor against racial suspicion and division is to be seen in what happened in another CIO union, Local 486, of the Midland Steel plant in Cleveland.
Here in a union where 90% of the membership are white workers, Joseph Jackson, a Negro and former vice president, has been elected president. As one commentator in the area, Ted Cox, put it:
“They (the members) wanted the best leadership available in the shop. So, when President Mack Cheek resigned, they looked around. They didn’t give a damn what color or what religious or political opinions that leadership might have. They wanted ability.
“It happened that Joe Jackson, who is colored, had that ability. So now Joe is president of one of the biggest, most militant and most successful local unions in the Cleveland CIO.”
Here, therefore, are two good example of how trade unions, militant and democratically controlled by the rank-and-file, are educating white workers to the necessity for complete equality.
 

Much Still to Be Done
The editorial page of the latest issue of The Chicago Defender features a cartoon by Jay Jackson, entitled Back Of It All. It shows a factory entitled “National Defense Work,” bearing a sign “Help Wanted.” In front of it stands a Negro worker in overalls, labelled “Negro Labor,” and he is held up, prevented from entering it, by a huge hand extended in front of him, barring his entrance. This hand is labelled “A.F.L.”
The point of the cartoon is quite evidently that Negro labor could get jobs in the war industries if it were not for the AFL, which is “back of it all.”
Does such a cartoon help the struggle to open the doors of industry to colored workers? We think not.
Who owns and controls and runs the factories? The unions – or the bosses? To ask the question is to answer it. It is the bosses of course, and it is they and their managers who do the hiring. Who benefits from division of the races, who really profits from it, the unions or the bosses? The bosses, of course, because they can play one race against the other.
Plenty of factories in the war industries are not organized at all. How many of these hire Negroes any more than the factories that are organized?
It is incorrect and misleading to say that the main responsibility for discrimination in hiring in the war industries lies at the door of the AFL. To do so serves only to whitewash the role of bosses who are really responsible.
We do not seek in any way to minimize or excuse or cover up the stupid, reactionary and vicious part played by some union leaders in the AFL. We denounce them and we carry on a fight against their harmful policies.
After all, what is “back of it all” even in the case of AFL officials guilty of Jim Crow practices? Isn’t it the training they received from the capitalist system? Isn’t it the prejudices they inherited from the “respectable” captains of industry whom so many of them try to imitate?/p>

 




The Struggle Against Jim Crow
Two of the most important questions facing the masses of Negroes today are:

winning equal rights in the armed forces of the nation, where they are being Jim Crowed by the government, and
 
getting jobs in the rapidly expanding war industries, from which they have been generally excluded by the bosses.

The first is as important as the second, if only because what is involved here is governmental endorsement of the principles of Jim Crow-ism, which can then be pointed to by the advocates of “white supremacy” as a pattern for all spheres of American life. But in an immediate sense, immediate sense, the second is more important in that today this question is agitating more of the Negro people.
And after all, look at what is going on, The whole economy of the nation is being shifted to a war basis. Production of all the great and important industries is being reorganized and expanded. The factories and machinery which the bosses kept idle for over ten years when people were starving are now being opened and put to use to produce the instruments of war. The bosses and their corporations are rolling in profits. The cost of living is going up for everyone, but so far most of the unions have managed to boost wages along accordingly, so that the standard of living of many of the white workers is no worse than it was before.
But where are the Negroes in this busy picture?
One industry after another bars them altogether from jobs that pay even a half-decent wage. They occupy only two kinds of jobs in the vast majority of the war industries that do hire them: in the menial, non-productive positions, or at the hardest and worst-paid laboring jobs. The cost of living is going up for them as well as others, but because they are excluded from the better-paying jobs in the strategic industries, their income isn’t able to keep up with it. The hullabaloo about the “end of unemployment” is being used as a good pretext in each state to slash the relief budget and the relief rolls far more sharply than ever before. Negroes who want to work and can’t get jobs suffer from this more than white workers, because at least some of the white workers are able to escape from the need of getting relief for the time being.
In short, the Negroes are being left out in the cold. The old saying about “the last to be hired” is still true.
 

A Correct Understanding Necessary
There are many obstacles that must be faced and overcome if this situation is to be corrected and the doors of the war industries thrown open to the Negro workers.
First of all, there is the opposition of the bosses, of the ruling class that owns and controls industry, who want to keep the workers divided along racial lines: “divide and rule.” Included as part of this is the government; acting in the interests of the bosses, it does nothing to interfere with their exclusion of Negroes from the important industries, but endorses it by its own treatment of the Negroes in the armed forces and civil service.
Secondly, there is the antagonism on the part of some, some, not all, white workers, who have been badly miseducated and have fallen for the propaganda of the bosses, and have thus permitted themselves to be used to weaken the strength of labor as a whole, including themselves.
And thirdly, there is the misunderstanding among many Negro workers themselves, expressed in an incorrect attitude toward the trade unions. We intend, in coming issues, to devote ourselves to a discussion of the entire problem. But here we want to touch briefly on one aspect of the third question, about which we have been asked to comment by some comrades who have run into in the course of their distribution of the Appeal to Negro workers.
Especially in the smaller industrial cities, some Negroes have come to feel a hostility toward the entire labor movement. We say to them:
“The unions belong to the working class, they belong to you; true, they must be reformed, and the scissorbill leadership of some of the unions must give way to a truly representative, progressive, rank-and-file leadership – but the unions belong to the workers and they themselves must make these changes.”
But these Negroes reply as follows:
“We don’t see how the trade unions are our organizations. They ignore us and in some cases they even kick us out of our jobs. Why should we even try to reform something that is so harmful to us? What reason have we to believe any good can come out of them for us?”
It is very difficult to convince these workers that they must be in the union movement, and must even fight to get into it. As Horace Cayton, the prominent Negro labor expert said recently, it is hard for a Negro worker to assume the role of a “lily white angel,” “making sacrifices for a principle which allows him nothing but unemployment and starvation.”
Before these Negroes can be convinced, they must be shown in action and through experience that they need unions to improve their conditions. Abstract arguments are not enough.
Already there exists some literature on the events of recent years showing the gains made by Negro labor on all fronts: their improved working conditions, the improved relations inside the unions between white and colored workers. Outstanding among these is the book dealing with the CIO, Black Workers In The New Unions by Horace R. Cayton and George S. Mitchell. We recommend its study and use by our distributors of the Appeal who reach workers interested in this question./p>

 




Jim Crow Plans of the Bourbons
There is an interesting story in Charley Cherokee’s column, National Grapevine, in the March 9 Issue of the Chicago Defender:
“Last week army big shots had a secret and informal session where they admitted concern over the attacks on the army for maintaining Jim Crow. One old colonel demanded peevishly: ‘Why in hell don’t they shoot at the navy and marines for a while?’ It was agreed that the program for the next few months will be to procrastinate and stall the critics by pointing to Brigadier General Davis and the Negro commissioned officers now on active duly ...
“These big shots are naive. Any Negro high school kid knows that General Davis will retire in a few months and that when the National Guards leave, there will hardly be a commissioned Negro officer in the army.”

That the conditions described about the Negro in the first world war in the series of articles by Eugene Varlin in The Militant hold true for today was corroborated by Duncan Aikman in his series of articles on the “national defense” program currently appearing in the Washington Post:
“I found a widespread inclination throughout the South to look upon the defense crisis as another crisis in labor relations. Southerner after Southerner, in various economic brackets, said to me substantially this:
“We’re not going to let the colored man come out of this war on top of the heap the way he did in the last one.”
“That means, and plenty of Southerners state it specifically, no colored officers, this time; no colored skilled labor training and, if avoidable, not even colored combat regiments.”
* * *
The Negro worker certainly did not come out on top of the heap in the last war, but what these southern crackers mean was that in the labor shortage of the last war many Negroes left the South for jobs in the industries of the North.
According to a speech at Kentucky State College by Robert Weaver, Negro administrative assistant of the advisory commission to the National Defense Council, the crackers need not worry about a repetition of what happened in the last war.
For the Negro is being kept out in the cold in the present industrial boom, according to Weaver, and from present indications, he will continue to be kept there. What is chiefly required by industry today is skilled and semi-skilled labor. The Negro, by and large, has been and is denied the opportunity to get skilled training.
 

Discrimination in Military Training
The Afro-American this week showed that Jim Crow treatment of the Negro soldiers is just as well organized in the northern camps as it is in the southern.
It showed that while the 20,000 or more white soldiers at Fort Dix, N.J., have been given training with rifles, steel helmets, masks, etc., “and afforded miles of wide open space for sham battles,” “the 381 colored selectees of company E are forced to drill on an acre plot without as much as a broomstick.”
“White army officials who were approached (for an explanation) appeared more eager to discuss the musical and entertainment abilities of the men.
“While none would admit that racial discrimination and segregation is being practiced at the post, all point with pride to the new cantonment area for the 372nd Infantry Regiment which is located beyond Hopkinsville – nearly three miles from the nearest white cantonment, and will be occupied around March 10.
“The cantonment, which will house 3,000 troops, in view of its isolated location, is definitely a segregated set-up.
“Because of the objection of the Southern white soldiers to sitting in the theatre with the colored soldiers, a separate theatre has been built the 372nd.
“Other entertainment features have also been taken care of in order that the colored troops will have no reason to leave their own cantonment. One high army official hinted that the 372nd will have its own maneuver area.”

“England is not perfect, but she is better than Germany,” said the good Bishop J.K. Humphrey of the Seventh Day Adventist Church in New York last week. “Every Negro who wants to see Germany win ought to be sent to Germany, where he will be castrated.”
By the same logic one could insist that every American Negro who wants to see the victory of the British Empire, which rules over more than 100,000,000 colored people in the same way that Hitler rules over his subjects, himself, should be sent to Africa, where he will be castrated economically, politically and socially.

2,500 West Indians at a mass meeting in Port Au Spain, Trinidad, passed resolutions last month demanding (1) the outlawing of United States Jim Crow on British bases being leased to the U.S. and (2) payment of the same wages for labor by the U.S. in the British West Indies as in the Virgin Islands and Cuba.
West Indies wages, according to Nancy Cunard, are now:

Oil industry: 80¢ to $1.20 for 8–9 hour day.
 
Sugar: 30¢ to $1.00 for 12 hour day.
 
Cocoa and coffee pickers: men 40–45¢, women, 20–25¢ per day.

Pork, she points out, costs 30¢ a pound.
Wages in the Virgin Islands are 17¢ an hour, and in Cuba on “national defense work” $2.24 a day.
 



A considerable number of bills dealing with discrimination against Negroes in employment have been introduced in several state legislatures and in Congress. Negroes and trade unionists are quite naturally interested in learning what these bills are all about, which ones are worth supporting, which ones are harmful.
Most of the bills can be divided roughly into two categories: (1) Those which penalize employers who discriminate against Negroes in hiring; and (2) those which penalize trade unions which bar Negroes from membership.
In order for Negro workers to arrive at a correct approach toward these bills, it is necessary for them to think about them, not only as Negroes, but also as Negro workers.
To do that, they must be aware of the fundamental conflict between the bosses on one side, and the working class, including the Negro workers, on the other side.
The main interest of the bosses money. They can’t make it unless they have people working for them. These workers produce the material which the bosses can sell at a profit. Basically, the bosses don’t care who works for them. The ruling class as a whole would just as soon exploit and sweat a Negro worker as a white worker. It looks upon both in the same light: as sources of profit, as shoulders on which to place the burden of depressions created by the capitalist system as cannon fodder to be used in the wars for profit and privilege.
But the bosses who control industry have found it useful to exclude Negroes from almost all jobs but domestic service and agriculture. The bosses have done this because of their desire to find methods of keeping the working class divided, so that the workers will be less able to unite against their oppressors.
The bosses have poisoned the minds of large numbers of white workers with practices and theories of “white supremacy” and “Negro inferiority”. By their methods of propaganda, the schools, movies, newspapers, magazines, radio, etc., the bosses have sought to convince the white workers that they are not so badly off, because the Negroes have even less than they have. As a result of all these boss methods, many white workers have been taught to look down on the Negro people; as another result, Negro workers have been filled with suspicion of all white people, including white workers. All this is right up the bosses’ alley.
 
The Fight to Get Jobs for Negroes
In this situation, where the bosses are the exploiters and the Negroes are oppressed, it is correct to use every possible means to force the bosses to open the doors of industry to the Negro. It is correct to demand that the employers, who are getting billions through war controls, be refused such contracts if they refuse to hire Negroes.
This does not mean that we should place very much reliance on these bills as a means of winning jobs for Negroes. To do so and to forget about the method of mass action and mass demonstration to win concessions from the bosses, would be a great mistake. One good picket line is worth a dozen bills.
We must never forget that the government which is designated to carry out the provisions of these bills is a bosses’ government;. that it believes in the same things the bosses believe in: that it sets the example of “white superiority” in its army and navy and in civil service; and that already there are plenty, of anti-discrimination laws on the statute books which are not enforced.
 
Bills Against Unions Will Harm Negroes
The bills penalizing employer may do some good. But the bills penalizing unions can do no good at all and are certain to do harm both to Negro and white workers Both the white worker and the Negro worker are victims of the capitalist system. Each suffers from wage cuts, depressions, fascism and war. Each suffers from the bosses’ divide-and-rule policy, even though many white workers (like many Negro workers) don’t see this very plainly yet.
Both the white worker and the Negro worker want the same things: decent jobs and homes, the right to live freely and happily. They are both denied these things by the capitalist system of private property and profit. What they must do to unite their forces against their common enemy and take the things they have built and created end use them for the common good of all.
Unfortunately, the workers of both races don’t see things as clearly as that yet. They don’t fully understand that they have a common goal and that they must act together and for each other. Fortunately, large numbers of white workers in the CIO unions have begun to learn this through their own experiences of fighting side by side with Negro workers in strikes and on picket lines.
We can readily understand and sympathize with the resentment of the Negroes against the Jim Crow leadership of some of the AFL unions and the railroad brotherhoods. We of the Socialist Workers Party have always fought for full and unqualified equality for the Negro people. Our record shows that we have consistently fought William Green and Co. on this question.
Nevertheless we are forced to oppose passage of any bill penalizing unions. We oppose such bills because they will hurt the interests of the Negro and white workers alike.
The bosses could and would try to use such bills, in the name of “destroying discrimination,” to destroy the labor movement. We cannot delegate to the bosses or to the bosses’ government the job of destroying Jim Crowism in the unions, for the bosses are the friends of neither the Negroes nor the unions. They would try to destroy the unions, not to help one section of the working class, the Negroes, but to cut wages and lengthen hours of all workers including the Negroes.
 
We Can’t Let Enemies “Clean” Our House
We cannot depend on the boss government which Jim Crows the Negro in the army and navy to wipe out Jim Crowism in the labor movement. That job can be done only by the advanced workers of all races.
Passage of such bills against unions would not serve to educate the backward white workers in the unions. On the contrary, it would tend to arouse their antagonism to colored workers. The lily-white leaders in such unions would point to the bill and say that the Negroes are cooperating with the enemies of labor in destroying the unions, and would use that to incite the backward white workers still further against the Negroes.
 
The CIO Shows What Can Be Done
The only way to educate the backward rank-and-file unionists to the need of admitting Negroes on an equal basis to all unions is by showing them that unity is necessary to protect the unions gains, and that Negroes are good unionists who want to protect the unions.
This is often a hard job, we admit, but there is no other way to unite black and white? That it is not impossible is shown in the sample of the powerful CIO, where Negroes are admitted as members with full equality and play a leading role in the unions. The example of the CIO can be effectively used in the fight to expose the reactionary policy of the lily-white leaders like Green and Harrison.
Summed up, this means that bills penalizing unions will never accomplish the purposes hoped for by many sincere Negroes, and that instead of serving to integrate Negroes into the labor movement, such bills would tend to make that task more difficult.
“But,” some Negroes will say, “these bills are not aimed at all the unions, they are aimed only at some unions guilty of Jim Crowism. We believe in unionism, we want to be good union men. It is the enemies of the Negroes who are keeping us from becoming good and devoted unionists.”
There is truth in this argument, but still it is not enough to change the fundamental task. Opening “only some” unions to the attacks of the bosses and their government is a springboard for opening the union movement as a whole to such attacks. For once some unions can be smashed, the appetite of the bosses will be whetted, and they will not be satisfied to let it go at that. We cannot ask our enemies to clean our own house, for they will not do it in our interests.. And the labor movement is the house of the Negro people. As against the bosses, we must defend the unions, even when some of their leaders or members have done wrong against the working class. If in any way we help the bosses to weaken our own class organizing, we lay ourselves open, and the Negroes lay themselves open, to attacks that if successful will send us all back ten or 15 years.
Meanwhile, the advanced workers, the class conscious workers, the more far-seeing workers of all races, will work with us in educating all trade unionists. Widespread discussion of these bills can do much to awaken backward white workers to the necessity of admitting Negroes into all unions on an equal and comradely basis for the struggle to improve the conditions of workers of all races.
 




Fate of France’s Negro Troops
The most interesting story of the week was undoubtedly the banner story in The Pittsburgh Courier, under the title Half Million Black Men Killed To Save Honor of France, by R. Waller Merguson, the Courier’s war correspondent, who has just returned from Europe.
In this, the first of a series, Merguson tells a story which has never before been printed, the account of what happened to at least a million Negro soldiers who were drawn out of the African colonies and into the French army as shock troops to stop the oncoming Nazi war machine.
No one has written about it before only because both the French and the Germans don’t want the truth to come out, says Merguson. That truth is that these Negro soldiers were mowed down in cold blood! No prisoners were taken. These colored soldiers are not in Germany, they are not in any part of France, occupied or unoccupied, they were never sent back to Africa.
Since the article is copyright, and “reproduction in whole or in part expressly forbidden,” we are unable to say much more about it. Our advice: don’t fail to get a copy of the Feb. 22nd Courier!

The Poll Tax Fight
Action is being undertaken this week to petition the House of Representatives to bring H.R. Bill 1024. the anti-poll tax measure, out of committee, so that open discussion and a vote may be held on it in Congress.
This bill provides that failure to pay poll taxes shall not he used to prevent anyone from voting for candidates for federal office. Although, consequently, it provides for only a very partial reform, it is certain that it will be fought tooth and nail by the poll tax politicians who smothered the anti-lynch bill to death after a petition had brought that measure to the floor in last year’s session of Congress.
 

Judas Goats (Colored)
Dr. Rayford W. Logan, chairman of the National Committee on the Participation of the Negro in National Defense, did much this week to advance the cause of abolishing Jim Crowism in the armed forces.
Logan stated that the three colored men holding administrative assistant posts (Hastie of the Department of War, Johnson of selective service, and Weaver of the National Defense Advisory Committee) had been appointed only to serve as “barriers” against Negro “pressure groups” and were “being used to give them “a grand runaround.”
Anyone who tried to deny this would be a fool. These men are the salesmen of the Jim Crow policies of the administration. Their mere presence is supposed to refute the well-known “white supremacy” theories of the war and navy departments. Jim Crow announcements, coming from the lips of colored men, are supposed to sound better.
* * *

Jim Crow in “Defense” Jobs
A classical example of the endless circle of the runaround being given Negro labor by both the story of the Nashville, Tennessee, branch of the N.A.A.C.P., which has been carrying on an active campaign to attempt to get Negroes into industry.
First the branch tried to get a defense training course from the government and the local school Board so that Negroes would be able to get some training and qualify for skilled and semi-skilled jobs in the Nashville plant of the Vultee Aircraft
But the local school board replied that there was little chance of such a course being opened to Negro workers, because the Vultee management would not employ Negroes “in skilled capacities, even if properly trained persons were available.”
The branch then turned to the management of Vultee. The reply of the industrial relations manager was that they “do not now believe it advisable to include colored people with our regular working force. We may, at a later date, be capacities such as porters and cleaners.”
“From this distance,” says an Afro-American editorial entitled Why We Are For Henry Ford, “it doesn’t seem to us half so important whether or not the Ford plants are organized, as whether the Ford principle of equal opportunities for all workers shall survive and flourish.” (The “Ford principle of equal opportunity” referred to is the policy of hiring Negroes as “strike insurance” and threatening to fire them if they join the CIO union trying to organize the Ford. Empire.) “From this distance,” that is, from Baltimore, it may not seem so important to an editorial writer but to the Ford Negro workers who have to work at a pay 10¢ an hour lower than the national average for auto workers and who have to endure an inhuman speed-up which leaves them limp and almost lifeless after work, it seems a good, deal more important.
Warning was served on the AFL Executive Council by the NAACP that if certain AFL unions, such as the machinists, do not cease discrimination against Negro workers, they would “have no other resource” than to seek legislation amending the National Labor Relations Act to deny such unions the right of collective bargaining.
The fact that Negroes are even thinking of such action must serve as real food for thought for the ranks of the AFL unions. As long as the AFL permits such things to go on, the union movement will never be safe. While workers, to protect themselves as well as their colored brothers, must open the gates of the labor unions to them.
 




Jim Crow Means Death
Last Fall, Roosevelt laid down the law that Negro soldiers are to be segregated into separate regiments in his statement:
“The policy of the War Department is not to intermingle colored and white enlisted personnel in the same regimental organizations. This policy has proved satisfactory over a long period of years, and to make changes would produce situations destructive to morale and detrimental to the preparations for national defense.”
In an effort to stem the nation-wide protest that arose over this, Edgar G. Brown, an Uncle Tom “leader,” endorsed this policy and called for its extension.
In our criticism, of Brown, printed last November, we pointed out that not only does this policy in the armed forces place a stamp of approval on Jim Crowism and segregation in civilian life, but also that it directly involved the question or the life and safety of the Negro soldier in the segregated regiments. We said then:
“As long as the Negroes are separated from the white soldiers, it is very easy for the labor-hating officer caste in charge of the Army to pick them out for special assignment and work: as labor battalions, digging trenches and latrines, and as suicide squads, for the most dangerous work, where men’s lives are thrown away cheaply.”
Now, our charge that segregated regiments means more deaths has been proved to the hilt, in the European battles of the Second World War.
In the Battle of France, the Negro soldiers in the Senegalese and other African regiments were used purely and simply as a body and flesh barrier against the advance of the Nazi war machine. Hundreds of thousands of their lives were thrown away by the French-British army commands in an attempt to save what was left of their white regiments.
All this is demonstrated in the reports of R. Walter Merguson in his current series in the Pittsburgh Courier, and in the first article of a series by William Veasey in the New Jersey Herald Notes. Both have just returned, from Europe where they were able to witness many of the the events they write of and to talk to the Negro soldiers who managed to survive.
Veasey shows how the retreat from Dunquerque was made possible only by the sacrifice of scores of thousands of Negroes who were rushed up and thrown into the breach to hold up the Nazis long enough for the British soldiers to get away. If there were Negroes in the United States who didn’t understand what Roosevelt’s Jim Crow ruling meant before, they should certainly understand it now.

British “Democracy” at Work
An American Negro Press dispatch from Johannesburg, South Africa, reveals that not only are the Negro soldiers on service in Africa treated worse and used for more menial tasks than the white soldiers, but that they get paid less too.
Speaking in the Southern Rhodesian Parliament recently, a white major who had induced a number of Negroes to “go to serve the Empire in East Africa” stated that he had felt “uneasy in mind ever since, in view of the bad conditions and the low rates of pay which I induced them to accept, also the inadequate allowance we are making for their dependents and the generally unsatisfactory manner in which they have been treated.
“The pay of these men is only three shillings, six pence per day (about 43 cents). White soldiers get more than twice that much.”
They must be fighting for democracy at half price.
 

Lawson Defends Judas Goats
Edward Lawson, ardent supporter of the war and managing editor of Opportunity, magazine of the Urban League, sale of which – ironically enough! – has just been banned in government-operated post exchanges at army stations, has broken into print again. Recently he branded as assistants of Hitler those who call for the establishment of real democracy for Negroes in this country before they go to fight for it elsewhere.
This time he is engaged in defending the Negro “assistants” to various departments in Washington, who have been attacked because they only serve to prevent Negroes from demanding equal rights in the armed forces and industry.
Lawson’s defense, after rambling around and showing what a tough time these assistants have and now humiliating and tiresome their work is, concludes on the note that it is the masses of the Negro people who are responsible for “the apparent impotence of many of those who represent us in Washington.” Why? Because they haven’t insisted on giving these assistants “positions of greater importance,” and because they don’t give them “the full backing of our acknowledged political strength.”
This phoney alibi will he successful only with those people who accept Lawson’s premise that these people in Washington “represent” the Negro people.
It is precisely this which we challenge. We deny that they represent the Negro people. We maintain that they represent Roosevelt and the governmental and military bureaucracies which are trying to sell the war to the Negroes. That’s what they were put in there for, and that, by and large, to the extent that they can, is what they are doing.
As long as the Negroes depend on anyone in the Jim Crow government to solve their problems for them, whether its white administrators or colored administrative assistants, their problems will not. be solved.
It will be only through their own strength, independently exerted and allied with the trade union movement, that the Negro people will be able to wipe out Jim Crowism in the armed forces and industry. And then stooges in Washington and men like Lawson won’t be able to stop them.
 



The coming Newark City Commission elections may very well be decided around the issue of the ever-rising tax rate, which was $4.85 last year and which is driving thousands of home owners, grocers and small shop-keepers to ruin, at the same time that it is partially responsible for the rising cost of rent for the workers.
The forces of big business in Newark, are uniting around the coalition ticket of Commissioner Byrne (Hague Democrat) and Reverend Clee (Republican who was almost elected Governor a few years ago by denouncing Hagueism) and Company.
Crying crocodile tears about the plight of small business (when what interests them alone is the taxation of the big businesses, corporations and insurance companies), they say substantially the following:
“The tax rate is high and will ruin us all if we don’t do something about it. We must put people into office who will cut the tax rate. The way to do it is to elect honest men who will cut relief, because most relief clients are ‘chiselers’ anyhow. Stop sponsoring WPA projects, because there are plenty of jobs available in private industry. Fire more school teachers. Cut down on the City Hospital. Don’t waste money on the library budget. Don’t permit erection of new schools. Cut the wages of city employees”
And so on.
Tbe Ellenstein group has no satisfactory answer to the problem either. When the pressure for reductions is put on them, they respond by cutting the same things the Byrne-Clee group want to cut: the socially necessary items which are used primarily by the workers.
Secondly, it must he remembered that the more money they spend, the more patronage they have. This is a very important consideration for a group whose main program is stay in power at all costs.
Every taxpayer is thinking about the 1941 tax rate in connection with the election. In most years, the rate is figured out and announced in February or March. Unable to answer the problem satisfactorily, City Hall has decided to get around it – by not announcing the 1941 rate until after the May 13 elections!
 
Our Answer
There is an answer to the problem which would cut the tax rate and at the same time provide the necessary money for relief, library, etc. This answer has been presented by the Socialist Workers Party on numerous occasions. It has not been picked up by the City Hall group, in spite of its claims that it represents the interests of the “common people,” for only a party that is really opposed to big business could espouse and tight for it. For this reason, among others, we are calling for the formation of a labor party, based on the unions and embracing the unemployed and Negro groups, and running its own candidates on an independent platform.
The 1940 budget was 55 million dollars. Of this, more than 9½ millions were for debt services, the largest single item in the Budget. Of this, part is for amortization (repayment of past bond issues) and the rest is for interest on these loans.
 
Step No. 1
There could be a large cut in the tax rate if the City Commission let the banks and bonding houses go without some of that money this year. The city’s bonds should he recalled and refinanced at a lower interest rate. Of course, this would mean the bonding houses wouldn’t make so much money, but it would also mean that the taxpayers would get some real relief.
The city could go further, as some municipalities have, by just declaring a moratorium on debt services. The bankers would howl about “the sanctity of contracts,” but what they would mean really is “the sanctity of foreclosures on small homes” and “the sanctity of higher rents in the workers’ districts.”
 
Step No. 2
The second way to reduce the tax rate is by reassessing the property of the city. Many small homes are still assessed at close to pre-depression values, while on the other hand the larger properties are assessed below their market values. Reassessment of property that would raise assessment figures on the corporations and lower them on the small taxpayers, would lower the tax rate and at the same time would make the corporations pay more in taxes, thus placing the burden of taxation where it belongs, on big business which can afford to pay it. Since the Socialist Workers Party put this program forward. City Hall has adopted a weak and distorted variant of it. In an effort to cut the tax rate this election year, they are refinancing a small part of the bonds in the sinking fund. But they are afraid to go through with refinancing all of them, although that’s the only way to get a real tax rate reduction.
And similarly, they began a reassessment of property with these results:
The 1937 total assessment of almost a billion dollars was cut 67 millions by 1938, and another 67 millions the nest year; 1940 reductions were 51 millions, and this year 53 millions. Had both big taxpayers and small taxpayers received the same proportionate reductions, this would mean the tax rate goes up the same for both.
But there was a change. Out of this reduction of almost a quarter billion dollars, the bulk of reductions in assessment were made for big business, while the reductions for the small tax-payers have been comparatively small.
This is one reason why our slogan in this election campaign is: LET LABOR CONTROL THE CITY COMMISSION! Only a labor party can win the support of the small taxpayer and form a successful alliance against the aims of big business.
 



(George Breitman is the Socialist Workers Party’s candidate for City Commission in the Newark, N.J. election.)
The war boom in northern New Jersey, which began just before the presidential election last November and has been growing stronger each month since then, has put tens of thousands of workers back to work and has just about exhausted the lists of skilled and semi-skilled labor in the area.
This boom has not only provided tremendous profits to the bosses, but it has also, despite the bosses’ desires, been a shot in the arm for the trade union movement, and has resulted in an intensified organization of the heavy industries in the area, which have received the bulk of the more than a billion dollars in government contracts so far awarded to the employers of what can no longer properly be called “the Garden State.”
Workers are signing up in one factory after another, several militant strikes led by the CIO have already taken place, and important struggles are just around the bend in several important union situations.
All this has shown that the workers are ready to fight for better conditions, in spite of the waves of propaganda for war and for a “national unity” that will leave the workers helpless in the grip of the bosses.
But the question is this: Will this revived spirit of workers’ militancy and confidence be confined to the purely trade union field in this next period before the declaration of war? Will the workers continue to fight their enemies on the economic field at the same time that they leave their power untouched on the political field? Or will they logically the electoral and political front, challenging the bosses’ power This question will be decided for the rich industrial area of north Jersey in the course of the current Newark City Commission campaign, the only important election scheduled here between now and, the official declaration of war.
* * *
The main functions of the City Commission are concerned with money – with raising it by taxes and expending it for things like WPA. schools, hospitals, health care, housing, etc. The method of taxation, the emphasis on where the money is spent, and the policies pursued in the various departments combine to determine the character of the regime at City Hall.
 
Two Boss Factions
There has never been complete unity among the big business interests of the city over these questions. This has been reflected in the formation of two main factions at City Hall and in the old party machines.
The elections in 1937, at a time when the labor movement was on the advance, gave a clear majority to the group headed by Mayor Ellenstein, who called himself head of Newark’s New Deal.
This group was composed of the re-elected members of the Commission: Ellenstein himself, a shrewd independent Democrat supported by many unions, Labor’s Non-Partisan League and (unofficially) by the Stalinists, mainly because of his ’37 slogan, “Keep Hague Out of Newark City Hall”; Pearce Franklin, Regular Republican and self-advertised “Champion of the Underprivileged” who made much of the fact that the relief and health administrations are included in his department; and Michael Duffy, a habitual drunken nonentity re-elected by his police and fire department supporters.
The other two elected, who united front against the predominant machine, were Vincent J. Murphy and Joseph Byrne. Murphy (who received the highest number of votes and dislikes the Ellenstein group because by precedent he should have become Mayor) is the secretary-treasurer of the State Federation of Labor, and was elected with the backing of trade unions, LNPL, and the Communist Party. The campaign literature put him forward as “trade unionist, veteran, banker.”
Byrne, wealthy insurance company head, was the only man on his slate of five candidates, called the “Citizens’ Ticket,” who managed to be elected. This ticket had been hand-picked by the County Democratic Committee and had the backing, of Mayor Frank Hague of Jersey City.
 
Byrne’s Record
Although the Ellenstein group had a definite majority, Byrne began to build his bridges for the 1941 elections by picking as his central theme the ever-increasing tax rate (the $3.28 tax rate of 1933 had become $4.61 by 1938) and building himself up as the friend of “the taxpayer.”
Upon the death of Commissioner Duffy, Murphy refused to vote for any of Ellenstein’s nominees to fill the vacancy unless assured in advance that he would get Duffy’s department instead of his own unpopular finance department (really principled “labor” politics!). To this day, in. spite of hundreds of ballots, no fifth commissioner has been selected. The deadlock permitted Byrne to come to the front, because four votes are needed for appropriations. His course can be understood by an account of a few of his acts.
As soon as he was elected, he fired a large number of scrubwomen who had been employed to clean City Hall, and increased the burden on those whom he kept. Money had to be saved for the taxpayer, he said. For a long time he refused to vote for appropriations to finish the four swimming pools in the slum neighborhoods. He did not believe so much money should be “wasted.”
In 1938 he refused to vote for appropriations to continue the street repair projects which gave employment to about 10,000 WPA workers. He agreed with the reactionary Broad Street Association, of which he is a member, and the Chamber of Commerce, that it cost too much, and relief would be cheaper. He indulged in the worst kind of red-baiting in refusing to listen to the protests of the unemployed organizations against the mounting relief cuts.
To show his contempt for the labor movement, and his efficiency as a tax rate cutter, he overrode the decisions of his fellow Commissioners on two important city contracts a few week ago. Bids had been made for some city automobiles and for supplying milk for city institutions. The lowest bidders for each had been the Ford Motor Co. and the Newark Milk and Cream Co. The CIO protested the award of the contract to Ford because of Ford’s notorious anti-labor activities, and the AFL objected to the milk company because it had interfered with organization of its employees. The other three Commissioners, ears to the ground and aware of the nearness of elections, refused to award the contracts to them. Whereupon Byrne, claiming a law firm had told him he had the authority because the Department of Central Purchase was in his department, ignored the decision of the Commission and awarded the contracts on his own authority.
A bloc of the big business groups now being formed to win the elections in May has already selected Byrne as one of the two banner-bearers of an openly reactionary and anti-labor slate.

Tenth Anniversary of Scottsboro Case
This week marks the tenth anniversary of the opening of the now almost forgotten Scottsboro case.
We take note of it now, ten years after it began, to send our greetings to the five boys still held in the Alabama jails, to point out the remorseless class hatred of the Southern Bourbons who keep them there even though the whole world knows they are innocent.
Nine Negro boys, most of them still children, riding on a freight train from Chattanooga into Alabama, got into a fight with some white boys of around their own age and made them leave the train. When the train pulled into Paint Rock, Alabama, the train was stopped and the Negro boys picked up. On another car two white girls, dressed in men’s clothing, were also discovered, and taken into custody. They were taken to Scottsboro, the county seat, and word began to spread that the boys had raped them.
In short order, the boys were indicted for rape, quickly brought to “trial” and (with the exception of one child on whose case the jury disagreed) sentenced to death.
There was nothing unusual in this case. There have been scores of such cases in the South about which nothing has been written, which were passed off as a matter of course, where Negroes have been murdered to “teach them their place.”
But this case was not passed off. The Communist Party’s International Labor Defense entered it, provided lawyers and opened up a campaign which as it spread and secured support reached into every single important community in the country and every country in the world. Basing itself generally on a class struggle defense, the I.L.D. organized not only the legal defense, but mass demonstrations and meetings on a national and international scale.
Finally, one of the two girls confessed that they had been intimidated into telling the rape story. Because the case had reached such widespread proportions, however, the Alabama Bourbons determined to brazen it out, to show that Negroes have no rights in the South and had better not get any “uppity” ideas in their heads.
 

What Saved the Boys
It was the mass demonstrations and meetings in hundreds of cities which saved the boys’ lives. Again arid again, they were found guilty, again and again Alabama prepared to take their lives, but each time the courts, feeling the angry pressure of millions of White and Negro workers, retreated and ordered new trials.
Then, far away in Moscow, Stalin and his bureaucracy decided on the policy of “the people’s front, collective security and a Franco-Soviet Pact.” This was an order to the Communist Parties of the democratic imperialist nations such as France, England and the U.S.A., to try to line up the boss governments for an alliance with Stalin. To do this, they were told to support people like Roosevelt for elections, and in general to try to “soften” down the class struggle.
This meant, so far as the Scottsboro Case was concerned, an end to the class struggle policies which had saved the boyp up to that point. Early in 1936 the demonstrations had disappeared, and a new Scottsboro Defense Committee, hailed by the Stalinists, was set up. It turned down the class struggle program advocated by the Trotskyists and went to work on the case in a way that would suit the innumerable right reverend gentlemen on the committee.
 

The Result of the Stalinist Line
Ozie Powell, one of the boys, goaded by a sheriff driving from court, scratched back with a pen knife in self defense. The sheriff stopped the car, got out and put a bullet through Powell’s brain, paralyzing him for a long time and almost killing him. Despite the fact that everyone knew Powell had struck back in self-defense, the Scottsboro Defense Committee got him to plead guilty of assault with intent to kill! The result was that the state dropped the rape changes against him and sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment with no chance, because of the plea of guilty, of fighting the thing through the courts.
This was only one chapter in the story of a number of disgusting “deals” which were made at the time between the Committee and the Jim Crow judge handling the case. The whole story has not yet been told, but enough leaked out to show that both the Stalinists and the Norman Thomas Socialists had sanctioned a deal which would free some of the boys and keep others in jail. The deal did not go through exactly as planned, but four were released, and four besides Powell were kept in jail under sentences ranging up to 75 years on the same testimony which the state disregarded in freeing the other boys. When the whole truth comes out some time, it will be seen that these boys were sold down the river.
And meanwhile, nothing is being done by the Committee that can have any effect on freeing the remaining five. Attempts to organize committees in different cities by Trotskyists and other workers have been resisted by the Stalinists who point to the “official” committee that does nothing. No demonstrations are held, little is even written about the case. Requests for information from the committee bring answers like the following: “The only thing that can be done in the Patterson case is a request for a pardon from the Governor.” How? No answer. Who’s to force the pardon? No answer.
And meanwhile, with the defense movement bottled up by a class collaborationist committee, the remaining five boys continue to rot in jail and on the chain gang – while the Stalinists, who have put on a coat of “militancy” since the Stalin-Hitler Pact, dare not open their mouths about what really happened in the case nor reopen the case in a fighting campaign, because to do so would be a confession of their treacherous policies these last five years.
 



During the last war workers moved to the Newark industrial area in such great nurnbers that a housing shortage arose “so acute that the City was forced to erect tent colonies to shelter hundreds of evicted families; that thousands of families were doubled up in living quarters, and rooming houses were forced to rent the same bed to as many as three lodgers in one day.” (From report of Newark’s World War I Mayor.)
Conditions in the city today are rapidly approaching the same situation. There is a real shortage in homes, flats and apartments. As a result, rents are going up, families are moving in together, cellars and store fronts are being occupied, and when one family moves out of a house in a workers’ neighborhood, there are five to ten applicants for the place during the next two hours. And the trend, because of factory expansion, is toward greater migration into the area.
The picture of Newark’s 44,451 housing structures was shown in the State Housing Authority’s 1934 report:

Of every 100 structures, 80 were found to be of wood, the worst material, the quickest to deteriorate. Of every 100, 61 were bui1t before 1908, that is, they are more than a third of a century old, and were built on what are now old-fashioned standards.
 
Out of every hundred, four were declared to be in “good condition,” 45 were in need of “minor repairs,” 46 were in need of “major repairs,” and 10 were found “unfit for use.” That is, half of Newark’s homes were either not fit to live in or badly in need of repairs, and only 4% were in “good” condition.
 

Situation Not Changed
The Newark Housing Authority reported a few months ago that, in the six years since 1934, the Building Department has granted less than 5,000 permits for alterations, additions and repairs. This would mean repair work on less than ¼ of the buildings needing major repairs or unfit for use, “It is to be noted that many of these permits were for commercial properties and structures in good conditions, thus further reducing the apparent number of sub-standard dwellings affected (by the repairs).”
In this same period, about 1,900 housing units (not structures) were demolished, and 2,600 constructed. Private capital built less than 400 of these, the others being built by FHA and NHA. Since almost as many were demolished as built, the situation remains almost the same.
“In Newark proper,” said the NHA last September, “there has been no house building to speak of, in the past 12 years. New construction has been negligible. Demolition has far outdistanced private new construction in Newark in recent years. Today the most reliable information, obtained shows that there is about a 3% housing vacancy in Newark. A great deal of the 3% vacancies is regarded substandard, much of it unlivable ...”
 
What NHA Proposes
What conclusions does the NHA, appointed by the present city Commission, draw from this terrible situation?
“It is agreed by most of the interested government agencies, the Newark Housing Authority and the Real Estate Board and property owfrers generally, that whatever additional housing is needed in Newark should be created by private capital.”
Private capital hasn’t built any homes in 12 years. The housing situation is getting more critical every day. Therefore? Therefore, says the NHA with the approval of City Hall and both machines (the Ellenstein-Franklin-Brady group and the Byrne-Clee group), let’s not construct any more federal housing projects. Let’s leave it to private capital! But this is only part of the picture.
Not only does the NHA oppose building more low-cost homes, but it is preparing behind the scenes to “divert” a large or major part of the 2,435 units of federal housing already built or being built, “sell” them to the federal government for the use of “defense workers” on the grounds that poor housing for those workers will interfere with “national defense.”
Very little has been said of this in public. Certainly few of the thousands of low paid workers and relief clients who have applied for admission to these projects know what is coming. But already a bill is being prepared in the State Legislature (this is happening in other states too) which will permit the Authority to solve its problem about the skilled workers flocking into this area at the expense of the thousands who have been waiting for over two years to get into the projects.
That the NHA is already actively at work on this piece of skullduggery was shown in a statement of a member of the Newark Citizens’ Housing Council last week when he demanded reorganization of that body and complained, “I do not construe intelligent co-operation (with the NHA) as being yes-men to the diversion of low rent housing to the use of skilled defense workers ...”
The NHA doesn’t want to build any new homes, but it does want to take away some of those already built and change their character as “low rent housing” for “the duration of the present crisis,”
That is why the Socialist Workers Party in the present election campaign states that the housing crisis will be with us as long as the friends of the landlords and the representatives of big business sit in City Hall. That is why We say: LET LABOR CONTROL THE CITY COMMISSION! Build a labor party to take over City Hall, to prevent the “diversion” of low cost housing already constructed and to extend the housing program by building the homes necessary for the great majority of Newark’s workers!
 




The Fight Against Ford
In his latest broadside against the CIO, D.J. Marshall, Negro personnel head of the Ford Motor Company (who will be fired by Ford, not by the union, if Ford is organized), hurls the following challenge at the United Auto Workers Union:
“The proposition seems to resolve itself to this: The union tells colored people that, if they will join the union, they will get industrial freedom; the Negroes at the Ford, Motor Company tell the union that if they will give the colored workers this independence in the shops where the union is already established, then they might consider unionism.”
To answer this challenge successfully would be to win the great majority of Negroes over to the union and to practically assure that the workers’ ranks would be united and indivisible against Ford, Bennett and Marshall. As The Militant has pointed out before, what is needed now is an aggressive policy, a program that takes the offensive against the bosses, on the question of Negro rights in industry. It is not enough to prove that the CIO has not been guilty of discrimination. It must be demonstrated that the CIO fights for Negro rights throughout the industry, which of course Ford will never do. And the CIO can demonstrate this.
Negroes should say to Marshall:
“The proposition is also this: You and Ford tell the Negro that he is better off in Ford’s open shop than elsewhere; the Negroes tell you that if you will call off your anti-union squads of thugs, and if you’ll raise wages 10¢ an hour so they’ll equal, wages in other auto plants, and if you’ll reduce the speedup, and if you’ll stop threatening to fire us all if we join the union, then we might believe you. But you won’t do these things, because those are the only ways you have been able to keep Ford workers from joining the union in previous years.”

Who Taught Hitler
Greatly played up nowadays is the story of how badly Hitlerism treats and intends to treat the Negroes. The purpose of most of this hullabaloo is to work the American Negro, up to support the “democracies” in the imperialist war.
The Crisis and the Pittsburgh Courier this month have both shown that, cold-blooded as is the policy on the Negro announced by the Nazis, it is really only a duplication of the policy on the Negro carried out in most parts of the United States since 1877.
And. if there is anyone who doubts that the. Nazi policy on this question is stolen right out of the handbook of British colonial policy, he ought to read the following Associated Negro Press dispatch from Cape Town, South Africa, dated March 6:
“Restrictions and segregation even more vicious than that of the Southland of the United States, are in vogue here and growing constantly worse. Recently, when a new railway station was planned for Huguenot, two separate entrances were provided, one for whites and one for non-whites. Waiting room accommodations for whites were arranged for in the main building but non-whites were given a waiting room in a separate building ...
“It appeared that an important step forward had, been made when two months ago the Witwatersrand University agreed to allow non-Europeans (the local designation for any other than whites) to attend medical school at the university and to work for both medical and dental degrees. The number of non-European students was restricted to ten. The chief problem which the school authorities had to overcome was the matter of providing bodies for dissection during the student’s fourth year. It was finally solved by deciding that non-European students should be permitted to dissect only black bodies.”
* * *
A Washington dispatch from the same agency had this to report a week later:
“No thought will be given to assigning colored doctors, dentists or nurses to centers where they might at any time be called upon to serve white soldiers, according to an official U.S. Army announcement.
“This determination to confine colored professional personnel to troops of their own race was emphatically declared by Surgeon General McGhee, Friday, during a conference with members of a committee from the National Medical Association ...
“The general professing to represent Northern sentiment, said that under no circumstances could he see colored and white doctors working together in the same hospital or as examiners of recruits.
“Advised that colored physicians had served. white soldiers in recruiting stations during the World War, he said it was inconceivable to him that colored doctors could work on an examining team with white doctors, and that no attempt would be made to integrate them into white medical teams.”
* * *
Strange bedfellows have turned up around a bill to deport all American Negroes to Africa. Senator Bilbo of Mississippi, who stands for “white supremacy” and hates the Negroes, is the author of the bill. J.R. Stewart, successor to the late Marcus Garvey as president general of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, in a speech in Chicago early this month, endorsed the bill of the enemy of the Negro people in the following words:
“As a long range measure, though not through any heartfelt benevolence, Bilbo of Mississippi has a bill which would deport us to Africa (Liberia) ... I am not for Bilbo but I am for this bill and will fight to support it ...”
In other words, the Garvey movement which once attracted the hopes of so many millions of Negroes is now acting as the tail to the kite of America’s outstanding exponent of “Negro inferiority.”
 



The coming annual conventions of the AFL (Seattle, October 6) and the CIO (Detroit, November 17) will again bring to the forefront the question of trade union unity.
Militant trade unionists, who want to work out an answer to the problem of unity not on the basis of an abstract formula or ideal but on the basis of the concrete interests of the working class, will profit from a study of the positions taken by the different groups today advocating CIO-AFL unity.
Such an analysis will demonstrate that the slogan of unity as such is not progressive today, and that it is being used as the cover for extremely reactionary and conservative forces operating against the best interests of the labor movement.
 
Roosevelt’s Aims
Why, for example, is the Roosevelt administration so concerned about unification of the two union groups? Certainly not to enable the unions to better fight for improvement of labor’s conditions and protection of labor’s rights, because more than ever that fight in these days has to be directed against the efforts of the government as well as the bosses.
Roosevelt’s main interest in the unions, both craft and industrial, is to tie them to the war program, to get them in the interests of “national defense” to “make sacrifices,” to persuade them to give up many of their hard-won rights for the sake of “national unity.” A divided labor movement, entailing competition and a struggle for hegemony that leads to increased organizational activity, makes Roosevelt’s task more difficult. Roosevelt wants “peace” between the two labor federations as a prelude to “peace” between labor and the capitalists.
It is not hard to see that unity on the basis of Roosevelt’s program will reduce, not increase, labor’s strength.
 
The AFL Conditions
By and large, the bureaucrats of the AFL Council hold the same position today as they held a year ago when they expressed their willingness for “unity.” But the unity they want is the kind that will give craft unionism the domination of the unified movement and leave the industrial unions at the mercy of those who opposed their creation.
Such a unification as the AFL Council wants would be a blow to all of labor, for it would not only weaken the strongest unions in the labor movement, but it would encourage the bosses to go after the remainder, craft or industrial. One of the progressive consequences of the AFL-CIO split was that, in the wake of the pro-union spirit engendered by the organizational gains of the CIO union’s, the AFL was also able to add many new members. The dismemberment of the unions in the mass industries by the craft union leaders of the AFL might easily lead to the destruction by the bosses of the craft unions built near and around them.
 
What the Hillmanites Want
The Hillmanites in the CIO also support moves toward unification. They are not interested in seeing that the craft unionists become the dominant force – for they would prefer themselves in the dominant role, of course – but they are not worried about the prospect either. They feel that they could easily come to terms with the Greens and Wolls. Like Roosevelt, their main concern is in tying the unions in with the government.
At last year’s CIO convention the Hillmanites were the chief advocates of “resuming unity negotiations.” Although Hillman’s proposal was decisively rejected by the Lewis forces at the convention, and although Hillman himself was the object of an invitation to get out of the CIO and go back to the AFL by himself, he has chosen to keep his followers in the ClO. The reason for this was twofold. First of all, his use to the administration and the war machine rests on the idea that he “represents” the dynamic section of the union movement, the CIO. If he returned to the AFL, he would quickly sink to the status of another Dubinsky, a captive of the AFL Executive Council.
Secondly, Hillman has kept his forces in the CIO because it is there that he can be of most service to the administration in its drive to unify the unions on the basis of support of the war.
In the year since the Atlantic City convention, the Hillmanites have been “boring from within” the CIO, and it is unquestionable that they have made considerable headway since November 1940.
 
Role of the Stalinists
Last year the Stalinists fully backed the Lewis position against any unity proposals that would hot guarantee the victory of industrial unionism.
This year, however, they loudly proclaim, “conditions have changed.” Now they give unqualified support to the Roosevelt war program. Instead of collaborating with John L. Lewis against Hillmanites in the unions, the Stalinists have declared war against Lewis, although he is pursuing more or less the same union policies today as a year ago.
Criticism of Green and Hillman has entirely disappeared from the Daily Worker. The Stalinists have adopted the AFL Executive Council’s formula on “strikes and national defense,” namely, that unions must retain their right to strike but they must not utilize that right. (Daily Worker, Sept. 20)
The Stalinists are all-out for labor unification today. But unification on the basis of their program will be n different and no better than unification around the Roosevelt, Green and Hillman proposals.
 
Lewis’ Stand on Unification
The Lewis group is the only major force that shows any signs of resisting a unification that will put the craft unions in the saddle and make the labor movement wholly subservient to the war program.
Events of the last year have shown how correct was the decision of the CIO last November in voting down Hillman’s proposal. How many of labor’s gains in 1941 – the organization of Ford, Bethlehem, etc. – won through militant action, would have been achieved if the iron hand of the AFL bureaucracy were dominant in a unified labor movement? Wouldn’t much of the anti-labor legislation defeated by the CIO this year have become law by this time if the Hillman-Green tendency led the whole labor movement?
 
The Job for Militants
Of course, continuation of the split in the labor movement has its negative as well as its positive features, and a unification of the labor movement oft the proper basis is desirable. But class-conscious workers must never lose sight of the fact that a unification on the basis of the Roosevelt-AFL-Hillman-Stalinist terms can prove more harmful than no unification at all under present conditions.
To the demagogic and reactionaary plans of the Roosevelt war bloc in the unions, the workers must counterpose the struggle for unification of the labor movement on the basis of undisputed recognition of the victory of industrial unionism.
 




The Kind of War That Negroes Can Support
The Negro people are not pacifists. They view with suspicion the current talk about a war for democracy that will be conducted by a Jim Crow army and navy that will use equipment and munitions made in factories that refuse to hire Negroes. Rightly so.
But the Negro people have been ready to fight in the past on behalf of progress for society. They fought bravely in the American Revolutionary War in 1776, when this country won its independence. They fought bravely and eagerly in the Civil War of 1861 when the unity pf this nation was preserved, the political power of the South broken, and slavery abolished. Even in World War I, when they were told by their leaders that they would get their share of democracy after the war was won, they established an impressive fighting record.
Today they are justly suspicious about being fooled as they were in 1917. But they are ready to fight another war if it will be in their interests.
They are ready to fight against the anti-democratic forces at home, the ruling class that starves, cheats and insults them, that kicks them around, uses them and ignores them. In this war they will give their last drop of blood; no one will have to sell it to them with speeches; no one will have to try to sell them bonds to get them to give everything they have for its victory.
History will look back at it and call it another Revolutionary War, or maybe the Second Civil War, or the Third American Revolution. But the name won’t bother the Negro people so long as they know it will overthrow the whole system of Jim Crowism in all its spheres and permit them to raise their children in security and equality.
Once a serious struggle begins, and the Negro people see on the banners of one army the slogan, “Full social, economic and political equality for the Negro people,” they will rush to enlist in its ranks.
 

The Fighting Spirit Exists Now
How can we be so sure of this? Because of everything we see around us today. There are some who look at the Uncle Toms and misleaders of the Negroes, the men who sell themselves for a government job or even just a pat on the shoulders by their oppressors – and they say, “My God! What ever makes you think the colored people will ever wake up and fight for their rights?”
But we do not make their mistake of confusing the Negro people with a handful of treacherous and self-seeking lackeys who are only too pleased to have the world think they represent the Negro masses.
Even now, while the Uncle Toms, the Pickenses and Pattersons and Chaplain Robinsons, are doing their best to confuse the Negro masses, there is one example after another of what heroic far-sightedness the masses are capable of.
There is the example of the Negro March On Washington, and the little colored woman, 77 years old, who exemplified the response of the masses to a just fight. She lived in Florida and spent all her time selling buttons to raise money for the March so her people could have jobs and equality. She had money enough to get only as far as Savannah, Ga., about 700 miles short of Washington, but she swore she would get to the capitol even if it meant she would have to walk the rest of the way.
Of course, Randolph and White and the others called off the march, and she was probably a little discouraged. But Randolph and White cannot kill that fighting spirit.
There is the example of the brutality of the white MPs to the Negro draftees at Fort Bragg, and of Private Ned Turman who spoke up against it and was shot dead after he resisted attacks and cried, “I’m going to break up you MPs beating us colored soldiers!”
True, there are men like Chaplain H.A. Robinson at the same fort, a Negro belly-crawler who tries to cover up and justify the murder of Turman, but he cannot cover up or destroy that fight-spirit of Turman’s which sends an inspirational thrill through militant Negroes every time they think that here was a man who did not hesitate to die fighting for democracy.
Why has that war not begun yet? Surely the Negro masses know what they want. But the trouble is that the Uncle Toms work so energetically beclouding the issues that the masses don’t know how to get what they want.
This is the task for the militant, class-conscious Negroes today. They must study the past experiences, they must learn what exactly they have to contend with, just what forces they must fight against, what methods they must use, who their allies and friends are. They must prepare themselves for leadership, and then go out and organize their brothers and sisters for this righteous war.
They will learn that their enemies are the capitalist class, the bosses, and their political organs, the Republican and Democratic Parties. They will learn that they can get even the smallest concessions from these enemies by only fighting with all their might. They will learn that there is another and a much stronger force that has reason to fight and hate the capitalist system, and that is the labor movement which is also oppressed and exploited by the bosses, and they will come to see that they must make common cause with the workers and fight side by side with them against their common enemy. And they will learn through their own experiences that the Socialist Workers Party, the Trotskyists, represent the most consistent force fighting against capitalism and Jim Crow.
 



On September 11 a discussion took place in the House of Commons in London which, brief though it was, shed a lot of light on the Churchill government’s attitude toward the Soviet Union and on the relations between the Stalinists and the “democratic” imperialists.
It revolved around the recent charge by Jack Tanner, leader of the Engineers Union, that Colonel J.T.C. Moore-Brabazon, Churchill’s Minister of Aircraft Production, had expressed the hope that the Red Army and the German Army would exterminate each other and thus enable British imperialism to regain its dominant position on the continent.
William Gallacher, lone Stalinist member of the House of Commons, asked Prime Minister Churchill if such a statement represented his government’s attitude.
Churchill replied that not only did it not reflect his government’s attitude, but that the Minister’s remarks, made at a “private gathering”, did not reflect, as reported, the attitudee of Colonel Moore-Brabazon either.
The capitalist press and the Daily Worker have been content to accept this as a denial of the charge that Moore-Brabazon and the Churchill government would like to see the Red Army as well as Hitler’s army, destroyed in the war.
 
Churchill Really Evaded the Question
But actually, as the subsequent discussion showed, Churchill was not denying this charge, he wasmnonly evading it. All that he was denying agreement with was a particular statement and the formulation of that statement.
“I happen to know what the views of my right honorable friend are,” he continued, “because on the day Hitler attacked Russia I told him on the telephone what line I was going to take, and he enthusiastically assented.
“Moreover, my right honorable friend has been all the while ardently at work sending hundreds of fighter aircraft to Russia, many of which have already reached there.
“Although the phrasing of what he said at a private gathering, taken out of its context, might be misconstrued, I am satisfied that he was and is in fullest accord with this government’s policy. Otherwise I should not have appointed him.”
Churchill concluded by saying that he was “astonished that anyone could have taken the mischievous action of making this a sensation, which does nothing but harm to Russia as well as Britain and leads to suspicion between those whose fortunes are linked together.”
Churchill was annoyed that the whole question had been brought into the open by Tanner: he doesn’t want anyone getting suspicious about his war policy.
Since Churchill had denied that even Moore-Brabazon stood for the anti-Soviet policy with which he was charged, a Laborite, Emmanuel Shinwell, arose to ask Churchill if he would state whether Moore-Brabazon had admitted making the statement attributed to him.
“I think that would not be helpful to the general interest,” was Churchill’s interesting reply.
Churchill had said that Moore-Brabazon’s statement might be “misconstrued” if “taken out of its context.” What was it that Moore-Brabazon said that might be misconstrued this way? Just what was the context from which it was taken ? Why does Churchill think it would not be “helpful
to the general interest to state exactly what his Minister’s statement was? The fact that he does not quote the actual statement made is very significant. The likelihood is that it cannot be repeated without being construed in just the way that Tanner did!
And the maker of this statement which does not bear repetition, remember, “was and is in the fullest accord with this government’s policy”!
 
Churchill’s Evidence
Churchill attempts to make up for not quoting Moore-Brabazon’s statement by pointing to what Moore-Brabazon has been doing: that is, he has been at work sending hundreds of planes to the Soviet Union, “many of which have already reached there.”
This “material evidence” of what Moore-Brabazon has been doing is cited by Churchill as proof that Moore-Brabazon could not possibly be a supporter of the policy attributed to him. But this is only another and a more artful way of evading the question. For the sending of aircraft to the Soviet Union is not at all incompatible with the policy of so conducting the war that both the Soviet and the Germa’n Armies will be destroyed and Britain left in a position to dictate its own terms after the war.
As a. matter of fact, at this stage of the war, it is perfectly compatible. At this stage, where the Soviet Union can use all the aid it gets, the only logical way from the viewpoint of the British imperialists to carry out a policy of fighting the most immediate danger, the Nazi army, and at the same time preventing the Red Army from winning a definite victory, is by giving some aid to the Soviet Union – some aid, enough to continue the war and weaken Germany, but not enough to permit the Soviet Union to win. This is the policy now being carried out by the “democratic” imperialists.
And the great crime of the Stalinists is precisely that they do not expose this policy of Churchill, but hide it and call on the workers to support him because for his own purposes he sends the USSR a little aid.
Gallacher sensed the evasion, though he did not care to expose it, and he asked another question. He asked if Churchill was prepared to “clear out all those in the government who are not 100 per cent behind the Soviet Union.”
This was too much for Churchill. He does not intend to give the Stalinists anything but the privilege of supporting his policies. This privilege certainly does hot extend as far as permitting them to help form those policies. As for this demand of Gallacher – it would mean clearing out the whole government, including Churchill himself, for the only thing that that government is 100 per cent behind is the interests of British imperialism. If those interests include for the time being a little aid to the Soviet Union in return for a breathing spell from Hitler, as well as political support by the Stalinists – all right.
But 100 per cent or even 2 per cent support of the Soviet Union is impossible for the forces represented by Churchill who hates the workers’ state as much today as he did 22 years ago when he led the interventionist attacks against it.
 
Churchill’s Rebuff
So he answered “coldly” and with contempt: “I do not think that I should be prepared to receive guidance in policy or conduct from an honorable gentleman who, it is notorious, has to change his opinions whenever he is ordered to by a body outside this country.”
Whereupon Gallacher lost his temper and blurted out some truths about this red-baiter. Demanding a withdrawal of this “insulting remark,” he cried out: “It is a dirty, cowardly, rotten action on the part of the Prime Minister. It is the action of a blackguard. It is a foul and dirty lie.”
But when Gallacher had time to think it over, he realized that he had not been following the Stalinist line of supporting and covering up Churchill, so he got down on his knees and ate humble pie.
“After very deep reflection about what occurred this morning,” he said, “I want to apologize to you, sir, and to the House for the offensive words I used when I put to you my point of order, and I want to make a complete withdrawal of the offensive remarks made and directed toward the Prime Minister.”
In this incident is reflected not only Churchill’s, but the Kremlin’s political line as well. Churchill hates the Soviet Union and will make no concessions to it that will conflict with the interests of the capitalist class he represents. The Stalinists know this, although they will not admit it to the workers, and in return for the aid and promises of aid which Churchill gives them, they conceal Churchill’s role and aims, and call on the British and American workers to support his imperialist war.
Class conscious workers who want to defend the Soviet Union can support the political line of neither. Instead, they must concentrate on continuing the class struggle in their own country and fighting for an independent working class defense of the USSR.
 




North or South?
Even before the latest series of attacks on Negro soldiers stationed in southern camps, the demand was raised by various groups that all Negro soldiers be transferred to northern camps. But after the murder of Private Ned Turman at Fort Bragg, N.C., and the mass desertions from Arkansas by Negro troops who had been assaulted by white mobs for marching on the highways and denied ammunition by their officers for self-protection, it became a leading slogan of many papers and writers.
On September 6 the Chicago Defender printed a front page editorial which declared that “removing Negro troops from the South because of unprovoked attacks by prejudiced civilians as advocated by one of our contemporaries is far from being an adequate, honest solution of the problem. Besides being an unwarranted, indefensible concession, such a step would be equivalent to an official condoning of the inexcusable barbarities that have been committed against Negro soldiers.”
The Defender asserts that Negro troops “should be kept in the south or in any other section of the country where it is necessary and convenient to train them,” that the “government ought to be prepared to defend its defenders at all costs,” that the soldiers should be equipped to defend themselves.
 

Schuyler’s Answer
The following week George Schuyler, Pittsburgh Courier columnist, stated his disagreements with the Defender: “Any step that removes these soldiers from insult, persecution and brutality because of their color is an adequate step.” He points out that the administration is “not going to MAKE the South accept these Negro soldiers as anything but outcasts” and that it is not going to permit Negro soldiers to defend themselves from unjustifiable attacks. He reminds the Defender also that Negro roops are not being attacked by civilians alone for the “cold, hard fact is that most of their mistreatment has been at the hands of the Army’s military police.”
“Since the question of honesty has been raised,” he continues, “why not be ENTIRELY honest, and urge that all separate Negro units be abolished and Negro recruits and selectees sent to the same units as white men? Why not be TRULY honest and admit that segregation and discrimination are inseparable, and that fair and equal treatment is impossible of attainment in a segregated setup?”
And Schuyler concludes his defense of the slogan demanding transfer of Negro soldiers to northern camps by declaring: “Keeping the present Negro soldier in the South will neither halt the outrageous treatment they are experiencing nor cause the Administration to end it. Hence the best solution is to not station these young men in the South.”
Schuyler finds it comparatively easy to discredit the proposal of the Defender editorial because it is based on a false premise: namely, that Negroes have reason to believe that the Jim Crow government might be interested in doing anything about persecution and brutality against Negroes.
The government has shown that the only concessions it “cannot afford to make” are concessions that might weaken the whole system of Jim Crowism in the south. Today especially it does not dare to do anything to offend the southern ruling class because most of the administration’s support for the imperialist war comes from the poll tax south. Dependence on the government or its War Department is nothing short of blindness. And that is the chief weakness of the Defender’s criticism of the proposal to move Negro troops north.
 

Both Viewpoints Are Wrong
But the fact that the Defender editorial presented a poor case, does not make Schuyler’s case any stronger. For his own arguments are full of holes, and Schuyler himself sows illusions that are as dangerous and misleading as the Defender’s. While the Defender fools itself with the idea that “our” government will help fight Jim Crowism, Schuyler fools himself with the idea that Negro soldiers are removed from Jim Crowism in the government’s northern camps.
Of course, “any step that removes these soldiers from insult, persecution and brutality because of their color is an adequate step.” But who dares to say that Negro soldiers don’t face insult, persecution and brutality in northern camps?
Schuyler reminds the Defender that it’s not only civilians but Army MP’s as well that mistreat the Negroes. Does he realize that this is an argument as much against himself as against the Defender? Or does he contend that northern MP’s love Negroes, while southern MP’s don’t?
Schuyler asked the Defender an interesting question. “Why not be TRULY honest and admit that segregation and discrimination are inseparable, and that fair and equal treatment is impossible of attainment in a segregated setup” (which exists just as much in the north as in the south)? But we’d like to have him answer it himself, and then justify his proposal as “an adequate step.”
But Schuyler’s argument can be punctured without referring to the obvious contradictions in his article. All we need do is refer to an incident that took place, a few days after his article was written, in the north, at Fort Ontario, New York, to be exact. For at this camp there occurred the same kind of attack on Negro soldiers by white soldiers that occurs in the south, Negro soldiers were attacked, beaten and driven out of the hospital. What does Schuyler propose for them? To go further north, perhaps? To Canada or Alaska?
 




Fascist Ideas and Jim Crow
In the course of a discussion held in Mexico on April 4, 1939, Leon Trotsky said:
“Fascism in the United States will be directed against the Jews and the Negroes, but against the Negroes particularly, and in a most terrible manner, A ‘privileged’ condition will be created for the American white workers on the back of the Negroes.”
In spite of the fact that this country is today preparing in every sphere for an all-out war, directed presumably “against fascism” abroad, the ideas of fascism right here at home in “the arsenal of the democracies” are gaining strength and new supporters with alarming speed.
The speech of that advocate of white supremacy, Lindbergh, attacking the Jewish people last week, is an example of this growing trend. This speech – not yet repudiated by any of his colleagues on the America First Committee – has received much publicity, especially through the efforts of the interventionist war-mongers Who are only too pleased with an easy opportunity to win supporters for the war by the cheap expedient of denouncing the racial prejudices of an outstanding isolationist.
But when it comes to Negro baiting and to Jim Crow practices developed in the school of propaganda-by-example, the interventionists have nothing or little to say. The reason is simple: in this field of racial division and the fostering of racial hatred, the warmongering administration takes first place and most of the responsibility.
Only here and there do you read about it – in the workers’ and Negro press, and occasionally in a liberal magazine – but at present the Roosevelt administration is doing more by its Jim Crow segregation policies in the armed forces to foster fascist racial ideas among whites than any other agency in the country, including the South.
The anti-labor bureaucratic caste in the army is not only teaching hundreds of thousands of white young men to hate organized labor and to receive an carry out orders given “from above” without thought and without question, but it is also teaching them – by separating Negro soldiers from them everywhere they eat, sleep, train, drill, get recreation, etc. – that they are better than Negroes. Thus the ideas of “white supremacy” and “Negro inferiority” are injected into the minds of young men, many of whom went to school beside Negroes when they were children and never had a trace of chauvinism.
Not every white soldier accepts these ideas, of course. Those especially who have been in unions, worked alongside of Negroes and walked beside them on picket-lines, refuse to accept these ideas. The Negro press carries numerous expressions of sympathy and protest from white workers in southern camps who have been revolted and disgusted by the vicious Jim Crow policies and the MP brutalities practiced against Negroes.
But let us [not] be lulled by these accounts. There has been no authoritative poll on this question, but there is no reason to believe that the racially tolerant white soldiers constitute a majority or much of a majority at best.
For the pressure on the average soldier, all the things said and half-said by his superior officers, is continuous and powerful. In the end many white soldiers who never even thought about Negroes at home, tend to accept that distorted way of thinking which is so frequently encountered in the South: “My own lot is a miserable one, but at least I am better off than the Negroes” and “The Negro is responsible for my conditions.”
To those who think this is an exaggeration or an isolated phenomenon, we recommend the reading of an article, Why The Army Gripes by Harold Lavine, in the August 30 issue of The Nation. The article is all the more significant because this magazine is an ardent supporter of Roosevelt and his war program. When they print this article, it is not because they are trying to spread anti-war propaganda, but because the situation is so acute that they would like to see it corrected or alleviated so that it will not interfere with the war plans.
 

Lavine’s Report
Mr. Lavine interviewed 352 soldiers on leave in New York City and tried to discover what their complaints were. Here is what he reported about the attitude of many of them toward the Negroes:
“The inferiority complex which so many of the recruits have developed is reflected in their attitude toward Negroes. They haven’t just the normal anti-Negro prejudice which you find everywhere in the United States, in the North as well as the South. They HATE Negroes, and their hatred seems to be mounting to hysteria. They make sudden, irrelevant remarks: ‘Say, I read where Joe Louis is to join the Army. I hope they send him down my way. First dark night I’ll shoot the bastard.’ They occupy themselves with the problem of whether or not to salute Negro officers. ‘They say it’s the uniform you salute, not the man,’ I said. ‘The hell with that. I’d like to shoot them.’”
This is a terrible danger signal to the Negro people and the whole labor movement. Whatever happens in the war, a lot of people are going to get out of the army with strong fascist anti-Negro ideas. Whether the United States wins the war or not, these forces will further divide the Negro and white workers and increase the Jim Crow terror against the Negro people.
If there was no reason before for fighting the war program – and there were a hundred – here is a good one. If there was no reason before for fighting to take control of military training away from the bureaucratic officer caste and, struggling for military training under control of the trade unions and on the basis of equality for Negroes – and The Militant has been filled with such reasons – here is an undeniable one.
 



The new united front of the Stalinists and Hillmanites against John L. Lewis confronts, every militant worker in the labor movement with the necessity of having a clear and precise attitude toward the Lewis group in the CIO. This involves an understanding not only of the position taken by Lewis on the war, but also of the role Lewis is playing in the union movement today.
The Hillman-Stalinist forces are concentrating their fire on Lewis’ action last month in signing his name to a statement on the war together with 14 leading Republican isolationists. Let us begin, therefore, by examining that “anti-war” statement.
It is an out-and-out isolationist document. It opposes “naval action” and the seizing of bases outside the Western Hemisphere, although not opposing seizures inside. It declares against military action outside the Western Hemisphere but maintains “that American lives should be sacrificed” for “independence” or to keep control of the Western Hemisphere.
This “isolationist” statement is, in short, one calculated to serve the interests of those imperialists who are satisfied for the time being to dominate the Americas. It is no accident that reactionaries like Hoover and Landon could sign their name to it.
In addition, the statement comes out against governmental aid to the Soviet Union as “unauthorized” and because the Soviet Union is not a democracy. This statement, it should be recalled, is signed by people who are not opposed to and as a matter of fact support the sending of aid to British imperialism.
 
Lewis Policy on the War
No class-conscious worker can support this so-called “anti-war” statement that Lewis signed, for it is neither anti-war nor pro-labor in character. The fundamental fallacies in it are:
1. It is no more progressive to support “Western Hemisphere” imperialism than it is to support the imperialists who seek world domination.
2. It is incorrect to support government aid to British imperialism in the war as a means of fighting against war.
Such support will lead inevitably to involving the United States in the war. If the aid is to get there, it means seeing that the aid is not sunk, it means sending convoys to prevent the Nazis from sinking the aid. Sending convoys means entering on the road of direct and open “shooting” conflict with Hitler, it means “incidents” which can easily be used by the warmongers for the purpose of beginning the war. One step leads to the next, and those who advocate aid to Britain today must logically call for war tomorrow. Those who really want to fight against United States entry into the war will also refuse to support aid to British imperialism today.
 
The Question of Aid to the USSR
3. No militant worker can consistently oppose aid to the Soviet Union.
Of course, we cannot adopt for our own, the slogan of government aid to the Soviet Union, Those who would accept responsibility for such a slogan must accept the responsibility for convoys, etc. There is no doubt that Roosevelt is glad to use aid to the Soviet Union as a means of gathering support for his war program from those sections of the working class which opposed the lend-lease bill for Britain, but want to give aid to the Soviet Union.
But the workers cannot follow Lewis in his opposition to aid to the Soviet Union. Instead they must concentrate on the only real program of aid to the USSR, workers’ independent action against he bosses and their war and for the establishment of a Workers and Farmers Government that will be a true ally of the Soviet masses.
It is clear that the policies on the war which Lewis follows in no way resemble a militant, working class opposition to imperialist war. Between his policies and the policies of the Stalinist-Hilllnanite nited front on the war there is no real choice for the workers.
 
Differences on Building the Unions
The Stalinists and the Hillmanites do more, however, than attack the very vulnerable position of Lewis on the war. They follow this by attacking his entire role in the union movement.
We refuse to support either the Lewis position on war or the war-mongering policies of the CP-Hillman coalition; but we must recognize that there is an important difference between them on the question of building the CIO. While the Stalinists-Hillmanites are willing to subordinate everything in the labor movement to support of Roosevelt’s: war program, Lewis stands for the building of the CIO in spite of the war and in spite of the government. When it comes to this dispute between the two groups, which is one of the key questions for labor in time of war, militant workers cannot stand with folded arms, indifferent to the, outcome.
Militants must intervene when two groups are fighting over questions that will determine the future of the CIO, the independence of the labor movement, the preservation of the gains of industrial unionism.
When Lewis condemns the use of troops to break strikes, as at the North American plant, while Hillman condones it; when Lewis attacks the anti-labor functions of the National Defense Mediation Board, while Hillman collaborates with it; when Lewis leads the attack on Congressional and administration anti-labor legislation, while Hillman behind the scenes tries to make that legislation a little more palatable; when Lewis encourages the affiliation of the militant drivers movement to the CIO, while Hillman’s associates pass resolutions against it in the local bodies they control; when in short Lewis seeks to build and spread the CIO, while Hillman tries to shackle it to the Roosevelt war machine and weaken it in the struggle against the reactionary craft-unionists headed by the AFL Executive Council, then progressive trade unionists must support Lewis against the Hillman-Stalinist bloc.
By their policy for both the unions and on the war, the Hillman-Stalinist forces occupy a wholly reactionary position. Lewis’s position on the war is wrong and misleading from beginning to end, and will have to be fought by those who understand that the isolationists are incapable of leading successful opposition to the war in the workers’ interests. But this must not blind militants to the equally undeniable fact that the Lewis forces tend to resist the government moves to hogtie the CIO and destroy its character as the progressive organizational movement of the workers in the mass industries.
Those who want: to fight against the war as well as those who want to protect and extend labor’s gains – for both of which tasks a strong independent industrial union movement is required – will unhesitatingly take their side on questions of building the unions, against the Hillman-Stalinist united front.
 



In an article printed in a number of Negro newspapers last week, A. Philip Randolph, president of the AFL Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and national director of the March on Washington Committee, called for the organization of a million Negroes to fight against racial discrimination.
“Negroes,” said Randolph, “must no longer think in terms of little units, or small maneuvers. To this end, the March on Washington committees are out to enlist-a million Negroes to increase the striking and driving power of the Negro masses for their rights.
“Recent history in international and national affairs shows that it is not enough to be right. You must also be powerful. You must also build the machine with which to work and fight for justice.
“It was just, proper and right for the President to issue an Executive Order in the early stages of discriminations in national defense on account of race, color, religion or national origin as it was proper and just, June 25. But it never happened until the March on Washington movement was launched ...
“A million Negroes speaking at one time behind one vital issue will shake America and is certain to get a serious and respectful hearing.
“Let the Negro masses speak through a million voices.”
Randolph does not indicate whether he is just talking about something that would be nice or whether he plans to go ahead and take concrete steps to actually organize a Negro mass movement.
At any rate, his actual proposals are quite vague. All he says about the organizational work involved in creating such a movement is that it would be “an herculean task” and that “it perhaps will not proceed with a blitzkrieg tempo” because the March on Washington committee “does not have a quarter” and therefore the work will have to be carried forward “with volunteer workers.”
No Negro worker will deny the need for a mass organization that will fight for equality. With production expanding, with talk about democracy increasing on all sides, with their youth being called on to undergo military training, the Negro masses are ready to conduct a vigorous fight for their rights.
Money is not the decisive question. Plenty of organizations with finances cannot win the allegiance of the masses – and for a very good reason. They don’t have the proper program, they don’t have the proper internal structure. These are the [some text appears to be missing here]
“Let the Negro masses speak through a million voices,” says Randolph. Yes, but what words Randolph offer as the program for this organization? Is it going to make deals with the powers that be and call off militant action in return for promises, as the March on Washington Committee did last June? Is it going [some text appears to be missing here]
Is the organization going to be democratically run? Are the masses going to have the decisive word about the organization’s policies? Or is the organization to be controlled and directed from the top with a small committee not only making day-to-day organizational decisions but also the vital and fundamental decisions of policy?
All that Randolph has said on the question is this: “In it the organization proposed) every Negro will count. The highest will be as low as the lowest and the lowest will be as high as the highest.” This may be the answer in Randolph’s own style. But then again it may only be an evasion of the question.
But Randolph has never asked the masses to decide anything of importance – the program of the March on Washington, the right to decide whether the March should have been called off or carried through, the right to decide on the personnel on the national committee “announced” by Randolph after the March was called off.
Such a handling of questions is not only dangerous for the future of the proposed organization, but it also tends to hold back the initial steps. For many of the local committees will think:
“If Randolph doesn’t let us decide what our organization should do on a question like this, what reason do we have to believe that we will be permitted to decide policy later on? What guarantees then will be have against being sold down the river by a leadership over which we have no control?”
We Trotskyists do not hesitate for a moment to criticize the March on Washington Committee and its shortcomings when our criticisms can serve the interests of the masses. We feel all the more free to do so because from the start we gave wholehearted support to the progressive acts of the movement and defended it at each stage of its development against those forces which attacked it for being “too militant.”
Today we make our criticisms of Randolph’s call not because we are opposed to the creation of a Negro mass movement but because we are in favor of such a movement and want to see. it grow into a powerful force against Jim Crowism. We urge all advanced and class conscious Negroes to join this movement, to support and build it, and to try to make it the kind of organization that will win real successes for the masses. In addition, we urge the Negro people to be vigilant within the organization against any harmful policies or procedure.
If Randolph’s procedure in calling off the March last June had been correct – and we said before and after it happened that no greater mistake could be made – then he would not have to be coming before the people today. and saying that a million Negroes are needed to be “certain to get a serious and respectful hearing” from the ruling class and its government.
We warned that nothing could come of deals with the Jim Crow forces, that Negroes must organize to fight them all the way through. Randolph’s article is proof that we were correct, that his past procedure was incorrect and inadequate.
Negroes can learn much from the lessons of that March, and it is their duty to do so if they want within the proposed organization to avoid the mistakes its leaders have made in the past.
 




According to William Patterson, a Negro representative of the Communist Party in Chicago, the Negro people are behind the war because it is a war against slavery just as much as the war of 1861, “This is our war,” he said at, a meeting on August 20. “Black America will play its part today just as it did in 1776 and again in 1861.”
Last week we refuted Patterson’s claims that the Negro people support the present war, and showed that since it is an imperialist war (not for democracy, but a fight between capitalist bandits over control of colonial markets and raw materials), the Negro people are correct in not supporting it. This week we want to discuss Patterson’s attempts to win Negro support for Roosevelt’s war plans by pretending that today’s imperialist war is like the wars of 1776 and 1861.
 

Wars the Negroes Supported
The capitalist historians have always tried to play down the role of the Negro in those wars. They do this to bolster up their reactionary ideas that the Negro is inferior and incapable of playing any important role in society. More and more people, however, are learning the truth nowadays and beginning to understand what a tremendous part the Negro masses had in the construction and development of the American republic.
We do not have to argue the question as to whether the Revolutionary War of 1776 was progressive. Everybody knows that. A great revolutionary movement, it secured independence for the colonies from their oppressor, Great Britain, and resulted in the formation of the most democratic government at that time in the world. Like all great revolutions, it was carried on militantly, arms in hand. Progress was secured at the cost of much suffering and sacrifice. People who are afraid of revolutions today try to gloss over the fact that American bourgeois democracy was created only by violent struggle.
In this revolution, the Negro people played a glorious role. Crispus Attucks, a Negro, was among the very first to fall in it. Elsewhere, on all the fronts of the war, Negroes did not hesitate to give everything they had, even their lives. For their numbers the Negro people, freeman and slave, were as much responsible for the victory of the colonists as anyone else.
Not all the tasks of this revolution were accomplished in the 18th century, however. Feudalism still existed and had much power in the south, in the person of the landlord slave-owning class. The Civil War was the second American revolution, and it ended in the defeat of the south and the weakening and even destruction in most respects of feudal power in this country. It preserved the unity and independence of the nation, so that the capitalists could go forward with the economic development of the country. It destroyed chattel slavery and set the Negro people free.
Again the Negro people were in the thick of the battle, again they were on the side of progress and social revolution. Hundreds of thousands of colored troops fought and worked on the Northern side; their brothers in the south aided the Union forces as best they could. Lincoln and other Northern leaders admitted that without the Negro soldiers they would not have won the war.
 

What About the War of 1917?
Today the government and its lackeys, including the Stalinists, are using many of the same slogans employed in the two American revolutionary wars: for democracy, freedom, independence, against slavery, tyranny, dictatorship, etc. But the kind of war it is cannot be determined by what its supporters claim it is; for even Hitler knows how to use slogans in his own interests, even the slaveholders in the Civil War claimed that their war was in the interests of the slaves.
The Negro people in this country have already had an experience in wars and slogans which was very enlightening; that was in 1917.
And it is very significant that Patterson, who spoke about the war of 1941 and the wars of 80 and 165 years ago, had nothing to say about the war of 24 years ago, and the Negro role in and attitude toward that war.
For today’s war, so far as most workers are concerned, is a repetition of World War I, and the same kind of war. Patterson can’t mention it because the masses would immediately see through his stock phrases.
Again as in 1917 the capitalist class is conducting a war for its own profit. Workers are made to pay for it in money and blood. Negroes are Jim-Crowed in the armed forces and face a virtual blackout in industry. The outcome of the war will be the same for Negroes as after 1918, when they were lynched for daring to wear an Army uniform. (As a matter of fact already, even before we are in the war officially, the lynch spirit against Negro soldiers has been whipped up.)
This war will bring no improvement in conditions for the masses of the world, regardless of whether the Allies or the Axis powers win. Negroes in this country will get no benefits from a Roosevelt victory. They will have the same problems they had before the war, and probably worse.
The Revolutionary War and the Civil War were progressive, in the interests of the masses as well as the rising capitalist class. World War II, like World War I, is reactionary, in the interests only of capitalism decaying and in its death agonies. Negroes instinctively do not support it. Their instincts are healthy and correct.
These correct and revolutionary instincts of the Negro people must now be connected to an understanding of the kind of war they can and must support. This we intend to discuss week.
 




Bosses Responsible for Jim Crow
Every thinking Negro worker who is conscious of the real cause of racial discrimination against Negroes in industry will agree with the recent charges of John T. Jones, director of Labor’s Non-Partisan League and legislative representative of the CIO, who told a congressional sub-committee that “a handful of rich and powerful corporations” were guilty of such discrimination, and that:
“The use of one racial group against another, one national group against another, in order to beat down the economic standards of all, is an old story to the labor movement. It is the ancient maxim of divide and rule – divide and exploit.”
It would of course be foolish for Jones, or any other representative of labor, to deny that some workers too are guilty of discrimination, and of falling into the trap laid by the bosses.
But the important thing is: Who, or what, is responsible for Jim Crowism? The answer to that question gives us the answer to the responsibility for some white workers practising racial prejudice:
The answer, as we know, is that the bosses, manufacturers, industrialists through their capitalist system, are responsible for Jim Crow, they are the ones who profit from it. When we wipe out their power to discriminate against Negroes, we will at the same time remove the possibility of white workers succumbing to their propaganda.
 

The Bosses’ Flimsy Alibi
The same week that Jones spoke on the question, a representative of another organization appeared before another congressional sub-committee, and spoke on the same question.
He was Noel Sargent, secretary of the National Association of Manufacturers.
Sargent spent some time declaring how sorry he and his organization were that discrimination should exist, and claiming that the N.A.M. was doing its share in eliminating discrimination.
To prove this point, Sargent referred to advice given by the N.A.M. to its members that there should be no “arbitrary prejudices in employment,” and declarations by the officers of the N.A.M. that, “manufacturers should employ Negroes wherever, and whenever possible, in keeping with their general ability and their ‘acceptability’ to white fellow-workers.”
What is meant by the dropping of “arbitrary” prejudices? Only this, that the bosses should not practice prejudice without good reason.
The N.A.M. is not really opposed to Jim Crowism; all it opposes is overdoing it; what it opposes is making its prejudices too obvious and flagrant: what it opposes are actions which will make it clear to the Negroes that the bosses are responsible; what it opposes are cases of prejudice where the bosses cannot make it appear that the. white workers are responsible for Negroes being denied employment.
The N.A.M. continues that “wherever employees themselves have not directly or indirectly put up bars against the hiring of persons because of race, color or creed” manufacturers generally are. ready, to employ them.
In other words, the N.A.M., if you would believe it, is ready to hire Negroes, but it doesn’t because of the white workers who put bars in the way.
It is strange that the N.A.M. is not so eager to comply with the wishes of its workers in other respects. For example, recognition of the right of workers to organize, higher wages, shorter hours, etc. When it comes, to these questions, the bosses fight the workers 24 hours a day, and no time off on Sundays. But when it comes to the alleged racial prejudices of the workers, the N.A.M. suddenly becomes very cooperative and gives in to every request and wish, real and fancied, of the workers.
It does not take a great thinker to see through the game of the N.A.M., and to understand that the bosses, who profit from Jim Crowism by dividing and ruling, prefer to place the responsibility for their maneuvers on the white workers, most of whom as children went to school alongside of Negro children and never entertained a single Jim Crow thought until it was introduced to them by the white supremacy propaganda of capitalism.
 

Boss Tells Truth About Roosevelt
At the same time that Sargent tried to present the question in an anti-labor light, he could not refrain from taking a crack at the government for its pious statements urging industry to hire Negroes.
Claiming that the government “has sought to concentrate the heat engendered in this issue on industry,” Sargent stated: “The fact is that both the Government as well as organized labor might well put their own houses in order.” He then went on to enumerate the different instances where the government itself was practicing Jim Crowism in the armed forces and governmental departments.
Sargent was paying Roosevelt back for daring to even hint that the employers were responsible. In effect, he said, what right has Roosevelt to preach to us when he doesn’t practice his own preaching?
He made a good arguing point, but of course it wasn’t made in the interests of the Negro people. It was simply made to remind Roosevelt to say in his own place, and not even pretend to interfere with industry’s handling of the problem. He made it to emphasize the ridiculousness of Roosevelt’s hypocritical position, something which Roosevelt has already done for himself in his executive order urging an end to discrimination, but naming no penalty for disregard of his order.
 




Auto Workers Fight Jim Crow
It is clear that the United Automobile Workers, CIO, is fully awake to its responsibilities to the Negro workers, and understands that if it wants the aid of the Negro people in its struggles, it must do more than pass resolutions against Jim Crow, it must actively take up the struggle to win equality for the Negroes in the auto factories and in industry generally.
The convention of the union last week passed a resolution instructing all locals to fight for the following program:

Hiring of Negro workers in all departments in all auto, aircraft and “defense” industries.
 
Equal opportunities for transfers, promotions and training for Negro workers in all auto, aircraft and “defense” plants.

The delegates made it clear that they wanted the officers to carry out this program without any fail.
One Negro delegate in a moving speech said, “We (Negro people) want to demonstrate we are men and we are brothers and we believe in the CIO.” Most of the Negro auto workers have already demonstrated this. It is now up to their white brothers to understand that action on the job to fulfill the union’s resolution will make the Negro workers the best and most loyal members of the union.
The convention also passed a resolution demanding abolition of the poll tax which disfranchises millions of Negro and white workers and sharecroppers in the South.

Whose Idea Is Jim Crowism?
PM, New York newspaper controlled by Marshall Field, department store magnate who refuses to hire Negroes except as janitors or doormen, has been making a bid for Negro nickels by deploring Jim Crowism every now and then as “inconsistent” with the “all-out war for democracy” which PM so ardently supports.
Last week in their editorial columns they printed a letter from a white soldier in a northern camp, who told how his commanding officer had addressed the men in his company, some of whom were about to be transferred to a southern camp. The officer told them “not to drink with niggers” and not to shake a colored man’s hand when saying good-bye.
PM prints the letter to show its “sympathy” for the Negro people, to. “take the curse” off the officers, and to try to round-up Negro support for the war.
“PM does not condemn the entire army or entire officers’ corps on the basis of this one incident – although it is far from the only incident of similar nature reported.”
But, says PM, the main thing is this:
“The war against fascism must be a total war, fought with guns against Hitler’s guns abroad, and fought with ideas against Hitler’s ideas at home. Racial discrimination is a Hitler idea ...”
Of course Hitler has used persecution of Jewish people and other minorities to divide the German workers and maintain himself in power. But is it his idea alone? Did he invent it?
Every Negro knows that this is not true, that Jim Crowism existed and was nourished by the capitalists in this country long before Hitler was heard of. Racial discrimination is also a Roosevelt idea and a Willkie idea and a Marshall Field idea.
Racial discrimination must and will be fought and destroyed in this country. But that can be done only if it is clearly understood who and what are responsible for and benefit from it.
PM tries to confuse the Negroes by telling them the fight against Jim Crowism is tied up with and is part of the drive for imperialist war.
The truth is that the fight against Jini Crowism is part of the fight against those forces who want to get us into the war – the capitalist class and all its political and journalistic stooges.

Answer to a Reader
One of our readers has challenged our statement that practically all of the Uncle Tom leaders have already sold but to the war machine. Admitting that “many of our so-called promising young men” have already taken jobs in Washington as assistant administrative assistants, our reader nevertheless points to the formation of the Colonel Charles Young branch of the America First Committee as a proof that some of the Negro figures are still opposing the war.
It is true that there are a few Negro “leaders” who have not yet come out in support of Roosevelt’s war plans, who understand that the Negro masses are overwhelmingly against those plans and who figure on maintaining some prestige among the masses by not committing themselves as yet. Among these are J. Finley Wilson of the Elks and Perry Howard, Negro Republican.
But to assume from this that they can or want to lead the Negro struggle against war is to make a fatal mistake. For even if you forget for the moment Lindbergh’s anti-Negro phobias, you cannot forget that the America First Committee is only a “loyal opposition” to Roosevelt, and itself expresses the interests of one section of the Jim Crow ruling class.
They may hold out a little longer, but we can be sure that Wilson and Howard, like Lindbergh and Wheeler, will come rushing to the defense of the capitalists’ interests, once the war is declared and those interests are at stake.
 



On several occasions since the outbreak of the Nazi-Soviet war, the Nazi authorities have sought to explain the holding up of their war machine on the Eastern Front by the unusual way the Red Army soldiers fight back.
The New York Times of July 31 carries a story telephoned by their Berlin correspondent, C. Brooks Peters, containing the most recent of these “explanations”:
“The Russians, the Germans reiterate, simply do not fight according to the European rules of war. Regardless of the hopelessness of their positions, they allow their troops to be slaughtered rather than capitulate, it is asserted. Communist education and national administration for the last twenty years, the Germans add, have killed the souls of all Russians.
“For that reason, they continue, there is no possibility of the Russian armies suffering from a collapse of morale, because all the prerequisites of such a collapse are lacking’ as a result of the bestializing of the individual that has occurred in Russia.”
The predictions of “victory within six weeks” made by the Nazis and echoed by “informed” U.S. generals and military experts have fallen to the ground. They made their estimates on the basis of the weaknesses wrought by the Kremlin bureaucracy through its purges and repressions, and on the slow start of the Red Army in the 1939 Finnish war, a campaign toward which the Soviet masses for the most part had been lethargic. But they completely disregarded the other side of the picture. Leon Trotsky, because he understood that whole picture, often stated that the outbreak of a capitalist war against the Soviet Union would at the very beginning bring forth the strongest defensist tendencies in the country.
 
Trotsky’s Prediction Now Comes True
In 1934 he wrote in War and the Fourth International (and he repeated this thought many times thereafter):
“Within the USSR war against imperialist intervention will undoubtedly provoke a veritable outburst of genuine fighting enthusiasm. All the contradictions and antagonisms will seem overcome or at any rate relegated to the background. The young generations of workers and, peasants that emerged from the revolution will reveal on the field of battle a collossal dynamic power ...”
Trotsky was able to foresee this stubborn resistance chiefly because he understood the class character of the first worker’s state and as a result the determination of the workers and peasants, even under the parasitic Stalinist bureaucracy, to hold on to what they have.
Of course the Red Army soldiers don’t fight “according to the European rules of war.” That isn’t because they have a different military technique or different kinds of weapons, but because, unlike the European armies, the soldiers have something to fight for, and they know it!
The “European” armies (and this includes the United States and all other capitalist armies as well) have a different morale because they are made up of workers and farmers who don’t want imperialist Wars, who know they have nothing to gain because after the war as well as before, they will be victims of the same depressions, hunger and exploitation. They know that it is not the people who will benefit from the results of the war, but their masters, the imperialists, and thai the lives of the worker-soldiers are being thrown away in a cause that is not theirs.
That is why the soldiers in the “democratic” armies do not fight with any conviction. That is why they don’t feel ready to sacrifice their lives. That is why their main thought is to get cut of the army arid go back to their homes. That is why they have no confidence in their military leaders.
That is why the French army marched off to war, even against Hitler and everything hateful that he represents, with no cheers or enthusiasm; observers noted only lethargy. That is why in America today there is so little popular support of Roosevelt’s war plans. That is why the American draftees these past few weeks have been so resentful toward the presidential proposal to extend the term of their service indefinitely.
 
Nazi Army Is “European” Too
It is true that up to this point in the war the Nazis have maintained a certain high discipline in their armies, which would seem to indicate a much higher morale than is present in the armies of the democratic imperialists.
This morale, however, is only skin deep, and can disappear overnight. It was fostered by Hitler’s great successes, including the “peaceful” successes of 1933-1939 against the “democracies.” It continues to exist because the German soldiers know what happens to the vanquished in imperialist wars. They have suffered one Versailles Treaty already; they are desperately fighting to prevent another.
But once the series of Hitler victories is broken and the myth of Nazi invincibility exposed, and once the fear of another Versailles in the event of defeat is removed, discipline and morale in the Nazi army will fall even lower than in the armies of the “democracies.” Because fundamentally the German army too fights “according to European rules of war” and is made up of men who know they are not fighting for their own interests.
The Red soldiers, on the other hand, not only have something to fight against, as do all the other armies (against a semi-slave status under Hitlerism, or a semi-slave status under another Versailles Treaty), but they also have something to fight for.
 
What the Red Army Defends
The October revolution of 1917 destroyed the political power of the capitalist class, and then destroyed its economic power. The factories and industries were taken away from the bosses by the state, and the economy was nationalized. The peasants took the large estates away from the landlords and the land went to the peasants who tilled it. In spite of all the crimes and blunders of the Stalinist bureaucracy since then, the economic foundation established by the Russian Revolution still exists. It is this for which the Soviet troops are willing to give their lives rather than capitulate.
When the Red Army soldier fights the Nazi legions, he knows that he is not doing it for the benefit of a gang of bosses who will continue to exploit him after the war just as viciously as before. He knows that he is fighting for himself and his children; to preserve what he has left of the greatest revolution of all time, the nationalized economy which must exist and be extended before society can go ahead to socialism, peace and plenty.
The experiences of the last twenty years have not “killed the souls of all Russians” nor bestialized the individual. On the contrary, these experiences have shown the Russian masses the superiority of living in a workers’ state, even though isolated and, degenerated under Stalinism. Because they have freed themselves from the bestialization of capitalism and opened up the possibilities for a new life, they are ready against the greatest odds and with inferior military equipment, as in the civil war days following the October revolution, to fight until death to protect what they have already won.
 
Red Army Fights Despite Stalinism
The Nazis see in this great defensive struggle by the Soviet masses only “dead souls” and “bestialized individuals.” History however will decide differently and will record it as the beginning of the awakening of the masses of the world in World War II.
It is not that the Soviet workers live in a perfect state. No one knows better than they what is wrong with the regime whose foreign policies have done so much to alienate the sympathies of the workers of the world from the Soviet Union. No one knows better than the Soviet workers how this bureaucracy has fastened itself onto the state, sapped its energies and re – sources and weakened the nationalized economy.
They have seen with their own eyes the destruction of the Soviets, the emasculation of the trade unions, the elimination of workers’ democracy, and the transformation of the Communist Party from a party of Bolshevism to a mere docile figurehead for the bureaucracy.
But in spite of all this, they have something to defend. They know that if imperialism defeats them, not only won’t they get back the political rights and workers’ democracy usurped by Stalinism, but that they will also lose the economic foundations that they still have.
 
Stalinists Silent on Class Nature of Red Army Morale
And when we consider how heroically they are fighting, we can correctly say that in their own language, spoken with the rifle and tank, the Soviet masses show a much clearer understanding of the historic processes of liberation than do the learned professors and lawyers who excel at “socialist” warmongering.
These “socialist” gentlemen find the task of herding the workers into the war in the “democracies” a far from easy one. But the Soviet masses, living on a progressive economic foundation, even though they have been robbed of their democratic rights, not only rush to the front but continue to fight when .it means almost certain death.
It is only the Trotskyists who understand, explain and support the real reasons for the great defensist struggles of the Soviet workers.
The Stalinists, who are afraid to speak in class terms, do not give the real reasons because it would offend the imperialists on whom they are placing so much confidence; and because it would open the eyes of the workers in the democracies, whom the Stalinists are urging to support the imperialists in the war, to the fact that they have nothing to fight for until they too establish a workers’ state.
Those “radicals” – in reality counter-revolutionists – who are indifferent to the outcome of the military struggle between the Red Army and Hitler also have nothing to say about the reasons for the S6viet workers’ fighting enthusiasm, because it ill fits their pseudo-revolutionary theory that the Soviet workers should not defend the Soviet Union.
 
A Program for Soviet Victory
Nevertheless, the resistance of the Soviet masses by itself cannot insure Soviet victory. For that a program is necessary.
This program must call for (1) the institution of a. revolutionary policy toward Germany, and (2) the extension of workers’ democracy, control and rights in all spheres of Soviet life.
Such a policy would include the open perspective of revolutionary unity of the Soviet working class with the German working class; a pledge that the Soviet Union would oppose another Versailles Treaty at the expense of Germany; propaganda for the proletarian revolution in Germany and the Socialist United States of Europe.
The morale and strength of the Soviet masses would be raised to the heights by the revival of workers’ democracy – the restoration of the Soviets and democracy in the trade unions, the legalization of all pro-Soviet political parties, the release of all pro-Soviet political prisoners and their return to their rightful places in the army and industry.
If the masses are waging such a heroic struggle for a degenerated workers’ state, how much more courageously will they strain all their energy and resources when they feel that political power belongs to them and not to the bureaucrats! When they feel that they have the right to determine the important questions, when they feel that their success on the battlefields will not merely bring back the status quo, but will facilitate the extension of the revolution to advanced capitalist countries and result in a socialist world that will forever destroy the possibility of imperialist invasion.
With the adoption of this program, the struggle of the Soviet masses would indeed be transformed from what is still essentially a defensive fight, to maintain what they already have, into an aggressive offensive to gain what they want: workers’ democracy inside the Soviet Union and the assistance and collaboration of workers’ states in the rest of the world.
 



August 4th is the 27th anniversary of the beginning of World War I. It is also the 27th anniversary of another dreadful event – the vote of the German Social Democratic Party’s deputies in the Reichstag in favor of the war, followed by similar pro-war votes by the French Socialist Party, the British Labor Party, the Social-Democratic Party of Austro-Hungary, the pro-war Mensheviks of Russia.
The reformist and class-collaboration policies carried out by the leaders of these parties in peace-time thus produced a policy of supporting the war of “their” capitalists.
The “socialist” warmongers, by providing “good” reasons for workers to support the imperialist war, were helpful servants of the capitalists in World War I.
With the change of only a few words in their slogans, they or their sons and younger brothers are performing the same Judas functions for the imperialists today, in World War II.
In 1914 it was the parties of the Second International – socialists in words in peace time, recruiting sergeants in action for the imperialists in war time, who played the main role in rounding up the workers for the slaughter.
In 1941 the Second International repeats its inglorious traditions of 1914–18 but the parties of the Third International are challenging it for supremacy in the field of war-mongering.
Today capitalism has even less to offer the workers than in 1914. The decay of the system which can produce only war, fascism and unemployment has reached the stage where all can see and feel its degeneration.
 
“Socialist” War Slogans Haven’t Improved with Time
If the times have changed for the worse, so have the slogans and pretexts. As World War II is the extension of World War I on a wider and bloodier scale, so the arguments of the “socialist” warmongers of today are the extension of their arguments of 1914 on a lower and dirtier scale. In 1914 the “socialist” leaders on each side of the imperialist war supported their “own” capitalists. Their organizations had grown big, they had many members and newspapers and jobs. In the course of the years leading up to 1914 they had become opportunists.
The capitalists were willing to tolerate them as long as they would remain only a party of opposition – opposition, that is. within the framework of private property and profit. But in time of war, the capitalists need more than friendly opposition, they need “national unity,” that is, the assurance that the working class will unprotestingly play its role of providing the munitions of war in the factories and the cannon fodder on the battlefields.
Any party that tries to convince the workers that they have nothing to gain from imperialist wars and organizes the workers to put an end to the war and the system that creates the war, will meet the full fury of boss persecution, frameup and suppression. The “socialist” leaders, grown soft, did not want, by opposing the war, to jeopardize the gains they had made for themselves. Therefore they would not go before the workers and say the truth:
“This is an imperialist war. It is a war for the benefit of the employers and the monopolies. They are asking us to go to war to gain or protect foreign markets and colonies and sources of raw materials for them to exploit.” If the labor lead had [text missing] the workers would have answered “Very well, we must fight against this war, and you, our leaders, must lead us in this fight.”
The “socialist” warmongers cooked up slogans to justify their position.
In France, Russia and the allied countries they said, “This is a war against Kaiserism, which represents everything reactionary and anti-labor. Kaiserism must be destroyed before the workers of the world can go ahead to socialism.”
In Germany and Austria they said: “This is a war against Czarism, which represents everything reactionary and anti-labor. Czarism must be destroyed before the workers of the world can go ahead to socialism.”
The bosses, whom the worker had to fight every day for an extra crust of bread, would have had great difficulty in selling this line to the workers. Only the “socialist” leaders could do this for the bosses. In the name of a war for democracy, the “socialist” leaders drove the workers out onto the battlefield to die by the millions.
 
The War-Mongers Didn’t Destroy Czar And Kaiser
Both Kaiserism and Czarism were finally destroyed – but not by the imperialists, and not by the “socialist” war-mongers. They were overthrown by the workers, when they began to understand that the slogan of a war for democracy conducted by the imperialists was a fraud, when they turned away from the “socialist” leaders who had led them into the war. It was not the Allied armies that overthrew Kaiserism, but the workers of Germany; not the German armies which overthrew Czarism, but the workers and peasants of Russia. And when the Czar and Kaiser were overthrown by the independent action of the workers, the “socialist” misleaders who had told them to postpone their struggle for socialism until their own imperialists had won the war now told them to postpone it again.
In Russia, the “socialist” warmongers not only told the workers and peasants to postpone the establishment of a workers’ government that would put an end to the war, but also fought side by side with the capitalists to prevent or overthrow the workers’ government of Lenin and Trotsky In Germany they did the same.
The difference was that in Russia there existed a Marxist workers party, the Bolsheviks, which had grown up in struggle against the opportunism and warmongering of the “socialists,” and in Germany there was no such strong, experienced party. As a result, the socialists, Noske and Scheidemann, were able to help put down the German revolution while the Mensheviks were unable to hold back the Russian Revolution, which proceeded at once to stop the war.
When we look back now at the slogans of the first World War, we can see what dangerous lies they were. For the “war for democracy” led straight to fascism. The suspension of the class struggle by the German “socialist” leaders brought in at home a regime as reactionary and anti-labor as Czarism had ever been. In the name of democracy, the German “socialist” betrayers had first urged postponement of the fight for socialism, then they fought against the socialist revolution and murdered its leaders and thus they saved the capitalist system which was to destroy all democracy in Germany.
So in the end these “socialists” whose opportunist support of the war had been based on their desire to preserve their institutions, newspapers, labor banks and buildings, lived to see them all taken away, not by a foreign invader, but by that same capitalist class whose war they had supported and whose system they had saved.
Just as in 1914, the parties of the Second International are today supporting the imperialists on both sides of the war.
On the Nazi side are the Finnish, Norwegian, French, and Belgian “socialist” leaders, fighting now against “plutocracy” and for “a new order.” On the other side are the “socialist” leaders who were driven out of Germany and Austria, a small minority of the French “socialists,” the British Labor Party and the Social Democratic Federation of America.
Now they no longer merely postpone the struggle for socialism to a future date as they did in 1914: most of them have written it off the books for all time. All they want, they say, is democracy. If they could only get that back, and their little jobs and trade union posts and newspapers, how happy they would be. That kind of democracy would be socialism enough for them.
If the “socialist” warmongers are not as helpful to the imperialists as they were in 1914, it’s not their fault that they’re not. They try their best, they have tried to renovate their slogans and make them a little more attractive. If they are not as successful as in 1914, it is only because they have even less to offer the workers than they had then, and because the workers have learned a few lessons from the experiences of World War I.
 
Stalinists Are Now Most Useful War-Mongers
Although, the Stalinists are shouting many of the same slogans as the “socialists” at this particular stage of the war, their warmongering cannot be explained in the same manner as that of their brothers of the Second International.
They too were whooping it up for the war in Britain and the United States, and they too are rendering service to the imperialists in these countries. But their allegiance to the imperialist cause is for the benefit of the Stalinist bureaucracy.
In this way alone can one understand the shifts in Stalinist slogans. Two months ago their main emphasis in the democratic capitalist countries was against the war; that is, silence about fascism, and a policy of isolationism. Today the total emphasis is on the slogan against fascism: that is, support of the war and a policy of intervention. In Germany they made a shift too but in the opposite direction. In each case the slogans raised were calculated to help Stalin and his foreign policy.
For obvious tactical reasons the Stalinists present their slogans as dictated by the American national interests. Yesterday, for example, they said “Defend American democracy by keeping out of the war.” Today they say, “Defend America by aiding the Soviet Union and Britain.” In each case they really mean to defend Stalin’s interests by whatever policy they think will help him at the moment.
 
Supporting Imperialists Doesn’t Aid the Soviet Union
The Stalinists justify their warmongering by pointing to the need for defending the Soviet Union, a factor which did not exist in World War I. And certainly the Soviet Union, still a workers’ state despite its degeneration under Stalinism and therefore still a threat and challenge to the capitalist world, must be defended. The question is how.
Created by a proletarian revolution, the Soviet Union was able to withstand the combined civil war and imperialist interventions of 1918–21 by carrying on a revolutionary war and seeking to extend the October revolution. This was Lenin’s and Trotsky’s method of defending the Soviet Union!
Stalin, on the other hand, has pursued a policy of winning alliances and the “good will” of various imperialist powers. The price he pays for these alliances is nothing less than the chaining of the working class in the capitalist countries to the imperialist war machines. This is Stalinist method of defending the Soviet Union!
The Stalinists, by following this policy, not only don’t defend the Soviet Union, but contribute to its weakness and isolation. By subordinating the interests of the world working class to the defense of the interests of the Kremlin bureaucracy, they betray not only the world revolution but the defense of the Soviet Union as well.
Thus, though their motivations may superficially appear more revolutionary than that of the “socialist” warmongers, the Stalinists serve the interests of world imperialism.
As long as capitalism remains in power, the warmongers of the Second and Third International will continue to enjoy a certain amount of influence. But once the workers’ anti-war sentiments turn them in the direction of wiping out the system that creates war the “socialist” and Stalinist warmongers will be “swept away with all the other chaff, rubbish and treachery that constitute the by-products of capitalism.
 




The Army and Segregations
A United Press dispatch from Fort Bragg, N.C., last week told of another of the tragic outbreaks between white and Negro solders that result from the Army-enforced system of segregation of all Negroes in the armed forces.
Like most of the other cases reported, this one came about when a southern white M.P. decided for some reason to arrest a Negro private. So far the only version of the story that has appeared has come from Army officials. According to them, Sergeant E.L. Hargraves attempted to arrest Private Ned Turman, a Negro soldier on a bus containing over a score of other Negroes. The Army does not mention why the arrest was being made.
Then, suddenly, if you can believe the story, Turman grabbed Hargraves’ gun and shot him to death. Other M.P.’s opened up and apparently shot at every one in the bus. Turman was killed, another Negro seriously wounded, and six others suffered “minor wounds.”
One does not have to know any more to understand what is really responsible for this tragedy, which is so like the hundreds of other cases in other camps.
By order from the White House, Negroes are separated from contact with white soldiers in every sphere of military life. White soldiers who do not already have it are thus inculcated with the theory of “white supremacy” and “Negro inferiority.” The situation is further aggravated by the inferior accommodations for the Negroes (in recreational facilities, etc.) and the lack of Negro officers and military police.
Thus, racial outbreaks are directly caused and indirectly encouraged by the Roosevelt system of Negro segregation.
An ironic twist ends the story. The Army officials decided that it was a bad situation, and that there might be further trouble. So:
All of the 4,000 Negroes in the camp were taken out and sent to another camp nine miles away.
The headline on the U.P. dispatch reads, “Negroes Segregated After M.P. Is Slain.” The Army solves a problem raised by its own segregation policies by deciding to segregate the segregated!
 

What Will the USO Do?
Since the Communist Party has decided that the boss government will defend the Soviet Union, it has also decided that the bosses will solve other problems as well.
In the August 7 issue of the Daily Worker was an account of the Jim Crow treatment of Negro soldiers in army recreational life. A few months ago the Stalinists said that only the united militant action of Negro and white workers could end this and all other forms of discrimination. Now however they say of the problem: “Here is a task for the United Service Organizations.”
If this is a task for the USG, then the workers don’t have to worry about it anymore.
The Stalinists are deliberately confusing the issue. They know as well as anyone else that the USO is not going to do any more about Jim Crowism than the YMCA and similar bodies did in World War I. They know that all the USO can do or will do for Negroes is establish a few segregated recreational centers for them.
All the USO intends to do is make the Army system of segregation and discrimination a little more acceptable to the Negro soldiers.
And with this the Stalinists would now be satisfied. They too know that the bosses and their organizations will not end Jim Crowism. With their present bootlicking support of the government, they themselves do not dare to conduct a fight against it. And so if the USO would make army Jim Crowism a little less harsh, they could go to the Negroes, hail this as a victory and use it to justify Negro support of the war.
 

A Correction by Pickens
William Pickens, now working for the U.S. Treasury, complained this week that “so many, misstatements have been made about my position” that he has to explain what it really is.
The misstatements he refers to are the attacks launched against him from many sources for taking a $6,000 a year job with the Treasury to sell “defense” bonds and support of the war to the impoverished Negro people who want no part of the war.
“I am ‘selling bonds’ and am not a salesman of any kind,” he says, “unless we use a figure of speech and call it ‘selling ideas’.”
So print the correction: Pickens is not selling bonds, he is just selling out.
 




Is This the Negroes’ War?
No one will dispute the right of the Communist Party to say of the bosses’ war which the United States is about to enter that it is their war too. In fact, they can say so with the greatest justice, for they are subordinating everything else to support of the imperialist war.
But when they presume to speak for the Negro people too, and to say for them, “This is our war,” then they are taking just a little too much upon themselves and have to be brought to order – above all, of course, by the masses of Negroes themselves.
Last Wednesday in Chicago, William Patterson, old time Stalinist Negro leader who has successfully weathered a half dozen changes in the Communist Party line without blinking an eye, attempted to identify the sentiments of the American Negro people with the views of Stalinism.
According to the Daily Worker, Patterson, who was speaking at a rally with William Foster to whoop it up for Roosevelt’s war plans, “pointed out that the Negro people were behind the war because it was a war against slavery just as much as the war of 1861.”
He said, “This is our war. Black America will play its part today just as it did in 1776 and again in 1861.”
We do not care at this point to enter into a discussion of why Patterson and James Ford say such things today and why they are trying to round up the Negro people for support of the war. Everybody who keeps up with them knows that three months ago they were calling Walter White and William Pickens and A. Philip Randolph all kinds of names because they were trying to get the Negroes to support the war. And that they would still be doing this except that the Soviet Union was attacked by Hitler, and the Stalinists, instead of continuing the struggle against the ruling class here, are now currying favor with them, and dropping all opposition to the capitalists and their treatment of Negroes.
Even less room do we have to devote to the preposterous idea that the masses of Negroes are supporters of the war plans of the government. Anyone who is not blind or dishonest admits that of all groups the Negroes are the least enthusiastic about this war that will be fought with Jim Crow airplanes arid a Jim Crow armed force. Only among people like Pickens, a paid stooge of the government, and now the Stalinists, does one hear the phrase, “This is our war.”
What we do want to discuss is not whether the Negroes now think this is their war – an idea which they may accept in the future as a result of the pressure and propaganda of the Uncle Toms and Stalinists – but whether they should think so.
 

What the War Will Mean
What is the war about? Is it a war for democracy? The capitalist governments that claim it is do not seem very much worried about democracy in their colonies or at home. The politicians who are beating the war drums the loudest in this country, the southern poll taxers, have never been known to seek any democracy for the Negroes and poor white workers. The British imperialists who oppress, shoot and arrest the colored people in the colonies, are not much interested in democracy in those countries either.
No, it is simply a war for profits, for colonies, for markets to sell goods. Britain and the United States have control of these markets and colonies today, while the Nazis want to get them to exploit themselves.
Who will gain from the war? The bosses in the countries that win will be able to exploit the masses of the world. They will try to disarm the other bandits so that they continue this exploitation for as long as possible. That will be the kind of “peace” they will give us. One thing is sure: under neither imperialist rule will the colonial people of Africa, India, etc., be given freedom or security.
What will the war bring the Negroes? Temporarily it may bring a few jobs that will be vacated by white workers getting into the expanding war industries. It will bring insult and segregation and death to large numbers of young Negroes. It will bring increased prices and a lowered standard of living for 95% of the Negroes. And then when the war is over, it will bring the biggest depression in history, in which as usual the Negroes will suffer the greatest hardships. After that there will be only the prospect of World War III.
All we need do is state the problem as simply as that, and the answer is obvious: the Negro people, least of all, have any reason to say, “This is our war.”
We are not claiming that this answer solves all the problems of the Negroes. It is clear that it doesn’t. It can tell the Negroes what they shouldn’t do willingly, but that isn’t enough. Wars can’t be prevented just because the workers don’t want them, because as long as the capitalists hold economic and political power, they can force the workers into their wars even against their will.
But nevertheless the Negro must hold fast to his position: this is not his war, it is a war for the bosses who Jim Crow him. He may be forced to fight in it, but unwillingly and with the understanding that it is not in his interests. Only if he understands this, can he really fight in his own interests by supporting a different kind of war.
Next week we will discuss the kind of war the Negro people should support, as well as the reference by Patterson to the Negro’s role in the wars of 1776 and 1861.
 




Roosevelt Picks Six
When A. Philip Randolph and Walter White called off the July 1 March on Washington, Roosevelt issued an executive order stipulating that future contracts let by the government would contain a clause against racial employment discrimination, and announcing the formation of a five-man Committee on Fair Labor Practices as a subdivision of the Office of Production Management.
The very inclusion of the clause establishing the Fair Practices Committee was an admission that the executive order had no teeth since it made no provision for punishing employers who disregarded the new clause in their contracts.
After the Uncle Toms who condoned calling off the March had finished praising and extolling Roosevelt for his reat ”statesman-like” act, a behind-the-scenes struggle took place as to the composition of the five-man Committee which would ”investigate” all complaints of discrimination and ”recommend” punitive and corrective steps to be taken.
Exactly what took place behind the scenes has not been revealed to the Negro people whose welfare is involved. All that leaked out was >that it had developed into a fight over the question: Should there be two Negroes on this Committee, or only one?
In the end, Roosevelt solved the problem by appointing six men to the five-man Committee, and among the six, two Negroes.
So that even if no Negroes have gotten jobs in industry as a result of Roosevelt’s order, at least two of them have gotten posts with Roosevelt.
 

The Six He Picked
Picked to head the committee “was one Mark P. Ethridge, a newspaper executive from the South, labeled a “Southern liberal.” This is to satisfy southern sentiment, and to assure the Jim Crow sections of the Democratic Party that they will not be discriminated against.
The two Negroes are Earl B. Dickerson, Chicago alderman and a member of the Board of Directors of the NAACP, which endorsed the March on Washington when it was being organized and endorsed its being called off when Roosevelt made the request; and Milton P. Webster, vice-president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, of which Randolph is president.
Selected as representatives of organised labor were Philip Murray, head of the CIO which practices equality in admission and treament of membership; and to compensate for him there was added William Green, president of the AFL which refuses to do anything about the many affiliated international craft unions which bar Negroes from membership or admit them only to Jim Crow locals.
Representing business and industry is David Sarnoff, president of RCA. And with regard to industry and the Negro, Sarnoff certainly represents it in this case, for his own company hires practically no Negroes, with the exception of a few Negro salesmen and porters.
One thing these six men have in common: they are political supporters of the Roosevelt administration and its war program.
The Committee does not have any real powers. Its job is to investigate what everybody of high school age knows, and to recommend corrective steps to a man who has shown that he doesn’t want to take them.
 

How the Committee Will Work
The word “runaround” has always neatly summed up Roosevelt’s handling of the demand of the Negro people for equality.
Runaround is also the description of the machinery adopted by the Fair Practices Committee for the carrying out of its work. The set-up is as follows:

Any complaint of racial discrimination is to be reported to the local office of the state employment service. A field worker will be directed to ascertain the facts of the case from the sides of both applicant and employer.
 
In the event the field worker finds that the employer is at fault, “he will be informed of the President’s executive order and immediate adjustment will be sought.”
 
“Failure to reach a solution through these preliminary efforts will result in a referral of the case” to the office of the Chairman of the state labor supply bureau of the Division of Labor Supply, OPM.
 
“If satisfaction is not then obtained, the entire case is to be referred to Washington for the consideration of and adjudication” by the Fair Practices Committee.

This is all of the process reported by the Chicago Defender. Of course, it does not stop there. After the Fair Practices Committee considers and tries to adjudicate the case, and fails, the case goes before the arch-hypocrite responsible for all this rigamarole.
Negroes who want job equality and who pin their faith to Roosevelt and his Committee, had better be prepared to live to a ripe old age before anything is done.
As always, the struggle for Negro rights continues to require mass action and mistrust in all promises, whether they come from white Jim Crow politicians or Negro Uncle Tom stooges for those politicians.
 



Last week John McCormack of Newark, N.J., concluded a letter to the editor of The Militant with the question: “What good is the executive order that Roosevelt issued if it hasn’t got teeth to enforce it?”
We suspect that McCormack knew very well the answer to his own question. But if there is any one else who isn’t aware of the fraud and hypocrisy being practiced by the Roosevelt administration toward the problem of jobs without discrimination for Negroes, we reprint the following parts of an article by George McCray, Negro labor commentator, from the Chicago Bee, Sept. 21, 1941:
Many people have an almost childlike faith in the power of powerless government committees and commissions. During N.R.A., when we not only had a National Labor Board, but labor adjustment boards for various industries, organized labor learned that these boards of Mr. Roosevelt often wasted a lot of precious time but never got much accomplished. It seems as though Negroes are going to make a similar discovery.
No Results
Here is an enlightening series of events: July, 1940; the National Defense Advisory Commission stipulated that workers should not be discriminated against because of age, race, or color. No discernible change.
April 12, 1941; Negro employment and training branch was established in the Office of Production Management to make pleas for the removal of “employment barriers erected against competent and available colored workers either by employers or labor organizations.” Some results achieved, but frankly hardly worth mentioning. The most strenuous efforts of such field workers for OPM as Poston and Weaver succeeded in placing a half dozen Negroes here and there.
Most of the gains made in the building industry were due to a shortage of labor in many areas and to the bitter battles being fought between the AFL and the CIO to dominate the building industry. When the CIO went after Negro construction workers the AFL decided the time was ripe to change its policies and grant Negroes work permits, rarely union membership.
No Change
April 11, 1941; both Hillman and Knudsen sent letters to defense contractors urging them to drop discrimination. No change.
No Change
June 25, 1941; President Roosevelt, very much irritated by A.P. Randolph’s threatened march to Washington, took “strong” measures to prevent discrimination against Negroes. Government agencies were cautioned, a non-discrimination clause was to be placed in defense contracts; and another committee, this time one on Fair Employment Practices was to be created, to make investigations and to redress grievances. So far no change, but it should be remembered that the well-meaning, hard-working men on the committee really haven’t had time to tackle the problem.
No Change
August, 1941; Fair Employment Practices committee called on President, had their pictures taken, and recommended that he call on all government agencies to drop segregation and discrimination against Negroes. Seems like this was done once before.
Another Letter
August or September, 1941; President issues letter asking various department heads to review employment policies.
Some Results
September, 1941; Associated Negro Press carried story of five Negro stenographers who had been hired, in the United States war department over which Mr. Roosevelt himself is boss. The girls were “hidden away on the second floor in the sixth wing of the huge munitions building of the war department” with practically nothing to do.
In short, to sum up the whole experience in October, 1941, all the letters, statements, orders, and “well-meaning” committeemen in the world are not going to be able to do anything basic about job Jim Crow. The Negro masses can depend only on their own organized strength to win concessions and to win full equality.

Hastie Can’t Answer Baldwin
In a letter to the New York Times, Oct. 4, William H. Hastie, Negro Civilian Aide to the Secretary of War, attempted to answer some remarks in an article in the Sept. 30 Times written by that paper’s military commentator, Hanson W. Baldwin.
In this article, devoted to a discussion of conclusions that could be drawn from the recently completed Army maneuvers, Baldwin stated that it was the “virtually unanimous belief of many officers that they (Negro soldiers) do not make good combat soldiers” and that “many officers say that the present tendency to increase the proportion of Negroes in the combat arms of the Army is dictated by political pressure and is dangerous to the efficiency of the Army.”
Hastie undertook to argue the question. But he was unable – and afraid – to deal with the point in Baldwin’s article that is visible to everyone that wants to see it: namely, that although Negro soldiers by and large are functioning as well as any others in the Army, their officers, in the face of all the favorable evidence given by Baldwin, still belittle and underrate them.
Hastie doesn’t mind showing Baldwin’s mistakes – but he has nothing to say about this attitude, fostered and tolerated by Hastie’s own superiors and covered up by him, that is the source of all the discrimination shown the Negro.
 



American imperialism does not have and cannot afford to have a perspective of peace after the defeat of Hitler in this war, for it must work for world domination and the assurance that this domination will be maintained for ‘a hundred years, at least,’ Secretary of the Navy Knox told the American Bar Association in Indianapolis on October 1.
Knox’s warning that an American-British victory in World War II would not usher in a period of lasting peace but would be only the first step in the direction of world domination by the victorious powers, came in the course of a speech pleading for support of a naval expansion policy that would permit the United States, together with Great Britain, to “police the seven seas” after the war.
Knox, authoritative spokesman for the Administration, in this intimation of the imperialist war aims and problems of the American bosses, avoided much of the high sounding camouflage and talk about “four freedoms” employed by Roosevelt and Churchill to decorate their Eight Points.
America is already in the war, he said, and “the world has now grown so small, so interrelated, so interdependent that, try as we will, we cannot escape from this task” (of insuring American domination of the world).
“It is by no means sufficient that we take those steps necessary to clear the sea lanes of the bandits which now infest them. We must do more than that. We must do our full share and more, to guarantee that they shall be kept clear of pirates in the future ... (It means) that the great law-abiding, peace-loving nations (United States and Great Britain) must take the power into their hands and keep it there for a long time to come to prevent the inauguration of. another world war ...”
 
No Promise of Peace
Knox makes no promises that such a course will mean peace. As a matter of fact he strongly indicates that other wars will have to be fought by the master nations of the world if they want to maintain supremacy.
“We will not engage in any idle dreams of a millennium. We are not going to stop all wars. But I am convinced we, for our own safety and protection, and for the maintenance of our way of life, shall have to provide an interregnum in which we will not only devote ourselves to the pursuit of peaceful aims, but provide the essential might to enforce such a peace on those who are not willing voluntarily to pursue such a course.
“If we must fight, and mark this well, there will not be for many years to come a time when we may not have to fight, then with modern weapons what they are, let us determine that we will fight elsewhere than our own soil ...”
Knox has no illusions that the victory of either the “democratic” or the fascist imperialists in this war will bring in any lasting period of peace. Nor does he pretend that any World War II edition of the League of Nations will do away with imperialist war or imperialist peace.
“Sometime, somewhere, an international order may emerge which need not rely on force, but that time, unhappily, is a long way off.
“In the interim, a justly conducted, peace-loving force must intervene to save the world from self-destruction. The foundation of such a force, as I have indicated, must be the control of the seas by the United States and Great Britain ...”
 
What “Freedom of the Seas” Means
In this speech Knox dwelt at great length on the imperialist concept of “freedom of the seas,” and stressed its use not only as a slogan for complete entry into the war, but for world domination after the war.
“The objective of all naval operations is control of maritime communications and the ability to preserve such communications for one’s own use, whether military or commercial, and to deny them to the enemy ...”
“I hope that what I have said does make for a better understanding of how vital to us is the principle of the freedom of the seas. This freedom means that the great historic highways of the nations are free for the use of all alike, on even terms, save only those activities which are designed to be hostile and aggressive ...”
“Freedom of the seas” is not an abstract principle for Knox and the capitalist class he represents. In their double talk it becomes monopoly of the seas by the United States and its satellites. The seas will be “free” to them, but they will be “controlled” for other nations whose activities “whether military or commercial” may be regarded as hostile or aggressive to the dominant powers. Thus, for example, the United States and Great Britain will be able to shut off the use of the seas to any nation that tries to compete with them commercially in any foreign market, for that would be regarded as hostile or aggressive.
“Aggressor nations must not be allowed to deprive other powers of the free use of the seas upon which their lives and futures depend. This is the essence of the meaning of the principle of the freedom of the seas ...”
Nations which the American- Anglo controllers of the seas consider “aggressive” will not be permitted to deprive other nations of the use of seas – only the United States and Great Britain will be able to do that, says Knox.
 
Who Will Run the World After the War
And who else besides the United States and the British Empire will decide these questions when the second “war for democracy,” is over? Knox makes clear that no other nation will have any say in this matter unless it is completely subservient to the interests of American-Anglo imperialism. “Other nations of similar peaceful inclinations, and lacking in aggressive designs, could be joined to them, and thus the beginning would be made leading toward the restoration of international law ...”
Here then is the American version of the “Versailles Treaty” for World War II. Here is the program for which American imperialism is spending billions and preparing to enter the armed conflict. These are the conditions Knox referred to in his speech when he said:
“When we have defeated Hitler, and destroyed this Nazi bid for world dominion, we must set up conditions which will prevent the rise of new Hitlers ...”
But Hitler was able to rise in post-war Germany precisely because of the efforts of the Allies to crush and dismember Germany. The economic destruction which Knox proposes for the rivals of American capitalism by its domination of the seas will in turn inevitably bring forth a new era of reaction and imperialist war. It is no wonder that Knox warns that American imperialism must be prepared to back up its war aims with “the essential might to enforce such a peace”:
Wars for boss profit followed by imperialist “peace” which will give way again to new wars – this is the perspective of American capitalism for the next hundred years. A true and lasting peace is indeed “a long way off” in the calculations of the warmongers in Washington.
Those who want to fight against the war must understand that Knox’s words describe the real war aims of the administration – that the talk about “democracy” and “war to end war” are only the sugar coating used to win support of the masses for a war that has no interest in democracy and no end in sight so long as the capitalist system remains.
 



William Pickens, A. Philip Randolph and others who support the war program as a “war for democracy” leap into print every time something happens which shows that Hitlerism is a threat to the interests of the Negro people. But they never have a word to say any more about the British Empire and its attitude toward the Negro people.
Both Pickens and Randolph are leading members of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The NAACP has just issued a letter addressed to Prime Minister Churchill describing five types of racial discrimination against Negroes being practiced by British agencies in this country.
But neither Pickens nor Randolph will make any attempt to answer this letter or deny what it says or to explain how it is that a government which is supposed to be fighting for “democracy” is guilty of the same kind of discrimination practiced by the Nazis against the racial minorities under their control. They will answer this indictment of British imperialism with silence – as they do all other questions which expose the fraud in their talk about a war for democracy.
The charges in the NAACP letter show that the acts of discrimination complained of are not isolated or accidental cases of Jim Crowism, but rather parts of a larger pattern which reflects the views of the British government. Let us briefly review them:
 

Five Kinds of British Jim Crow

Charles M. Ashe, fully qualified commercial pilot and instructor, was refused by the British Air Commission in Washington a job ferrying bombers from this country to England, solely because of his color. He was told that according to the regulations of the RAF Ferry Command, “all applicants must be of the white race.”
 
Dr. Walter W. King of New York City volunteered through the American Red Cross, in response to recent appeals from England for American doctors, to serve in England. He was rejected solely because of his color. He was told by the Red Cross:
“It is true that only white citizens of the United States are eligible for the Doctors for Britain project. The American Red Cross did not set the standards which are being followed. The American Red Cross is acting upon instructions and cannot deviate.”
The NAACP letter continues:
“Touching appeals have been made to Americans to contribute their blood to blood banks to be sent to save the lives of men, women and children in Great Britain who, without such aid would die from grievous wounds inflicted by Nazi bombs. Instructions have come to the United States from Great Britain, we are informed, that only ‘white’ blood is wanted. Does this mean that English men, women and children would prefer dying to living, if the balance in favor of life is non-Aryan blood?”
The British government has asked the United States government to refuse to send any Negroes, regardless of qualifications, to help build naval and air bases in islands of the British West Indies, and “visas are denied by British consulates to highly qualified American Negroes who wish to work in the British Caribbean Islands.” The NAACP letter, after pointing out that Negroes form 90 to 95% of the population of these islands, asks:
“Does the British Government bar these American Negroes lest the example of qualified Negroes filling executive and other official positions arouse too great ambition on the part of underprivileged Negro British subjects in these islands?”
The British Purchasing Commission in Washington has turned down all Negro applicants for employment, regardless of their qualifications, just as it has discriminated against Jews, South Irish and Germans.

The NAACP press release on its letter to Churchill concludes with the statement: “No answer has yet been received.” We do not guarantee that no answer will be received in the future, but we are positive that no satisfactory answer will ever come from Churchill. For Churchill is in full accord with the policies being carried out by his agents in the United States.
Those who have any doubts on this score need only read what he had to say about his much- publicized Eight Point Atlantic Charter with Roosevelt.
Deputy Prime Minister Clement Atlee, head of the British Labor Party, who supports Churchill’s war and tries to cover up its reactionary character, shot off his mouth that “Colored races, as well as white, will share the benefits of the Churchill-Roosevelt Atlantic Charter” and that after the war there will be “an ever-increasing measure of self-government in Africa and ... an ever-rising standard of life for all the peoples of Africa ...”
A few days later Churchill set the record straight on this question, for he would rather be honest than have the colonial people getting any false ideas and taking all the talk about democracy too seriously.
“At the Atlantic meeting,” he said, according to a censored report from the London correspondent of the Pittsburgh Courier, “we had in mind primarily restoration of the sovereignty, self-government and national life of the States and nations of Europe ... That is quite a separate problem from the progressive evolution of self-governing institutions in the regions and peoples which owe allegiance to the British Crown.”
When Pickens, Randolph and Co. remain silent on such questions, they help only to conceal the reactionary character of the British imperialism they want the masses to defend. Treacherous politics of this kind leads in the end to betrayal of the interests of the masses in their struggle against Jim Crow at home.
 



Our comrades in Newark, N.J., have sent us a copy of a leaflet issued by the Communist Party in that city, entitled A United America Can Defeat Hitler and addressed primarily to the Negro people.
In it the Stalinists follow the example set by the warmongering politicians who have taken advantage of Lindbergh’s Jew-baiting speech in Des Moines to try to make the war-mongers appear as advocates of racial equality and equal opportunity.
But, as in many other fields, the Stalinist propaganda is so crude and obvious in this leaflet, which is quite typical of most Stalinist propaganda, that it gives their game away completely.
“One look at Hitler’s friends in this country shows that they are also the preachers of hatred for the Negro people. Lindbergh and his pals are spreading the phony ‘racial’ theories which Hitler has spread over Germany ... It is no accident that Southern politicians like Senator Reynolds have lined up with Hitler. They see eye to eye.”
Now certainly Reynolds is an enemy of the Negro people and of the whole labor movement. He has for many years been associated with the red-baiting opponents of the trade unions, and was the organizer of a super-“patriotic” movement known as the “Vindicators” which spent most of its energy whipping up attacks on foreign-born workers. But in these respects there is nothing to distinguish him from most of the other politicians from the poll-tax states of the South.
There is only one thing that distinguishes him from the other Southern congressman, and that is that he belongs to the “isolationist” group, rather than the interventionist. At the present time, he is willing, for the sake of building up a pro-American fascist movement now and after the war, to exploit the honest anti-war sentiments of the masses. He is of course no real fighter against war; he stands wholeheartedly for the preservation of the system of capitalism which causes war.
But when the Stalinists speak about Reynolds, workers will naturally ask themselves, “What about the other Southern politicians who do not pretend to be opponents of the war, who are as a matter of fact, the most rabid advocates of the war program in Washington? Where do they stand on the racial question? With whom do they see eye to eye?”
The answer., of course, is well-known to the Stalinists, who published it hundreds of times only a few months ago when they were still opposed to the Roosevelt war program.
 

The Warmongers and the Negroes
Who are these other Southern politicians who are howling for the war? They are, almost to a man, cut in the mold of Pepper, Dies, Connally, et al. They are men who are elected year after year only because they deny the great mass of the workers, Negro and white, the right to vote. They are the men who by threat of filibuster and other kinds of pressure have prevented any kind of anti-lynch legislation from being enacted by Congress.
Only recently, Pepper, that great advocate of a “war for democracy”, arose on the floor of the United States Senate to declare:
“Whatever may be written into the Constitution, whatever may be placed upon the statute books of this nation, however many soldiers may be stationed about the ballot boxes of the Southland, the colored race will not vote.”
What do the Southern warmongers think about the Jim Crow laws of the South? What do they think about the laws and customs that segregate the Negro people in jobs, in church, in the armed forces, in every economic and social sphere and excludes them completely from participation in polities?
To ask these questions is to answer them. These pro-war Southern politicians not only strengthen and bolster segregation, but they are ready to stage another civil war if any serious attempt is made to destroy Jim Crowism. They did this long before the name of Hitler was heard of in this country. They intend to continue it long after Hitler is gone and forgotten.
These people see eye to eye with Hitler too, or perhaps it is more correct to say that Hitler sees eye to eye with them. Not on the war, it is true, but certainly on racial questions. To paraphrase the Stalinists, “one look at Hitler’s” imperialist enemies “in this country shows that they are also the preachers of hatred for the Negro people.” In this respect there is no difference whatever between them and men like Reynolds.
The Stalinists try to get support for the war by showing that the “isolationists” are enemies of the Negro people. That this is a false way of posing the question is shown by the fact that the interventionists are no less enemies of the Negro people.
Only we, the Trotskyists, can speak the truth on this question. We are opposed to all the enemies of the Negro people, and we don’t have to try to defend any of them.
We cite their records not to win support for a reactionary position, as the Stalinists do, but to show the hypocrisy behind their protestations about democracy and racial equality, and to show how the Stalinists serve the cause of a certain section of the enemies of the Negro people.
 



The American Federation of Labor will hold another annual convention next week in Seattle. Negro workers will look forward to the occasion with interest, if not much hope of anything important happening there.
They know pretty well what to expect, under present conditions and with the kind of leadership AFL has today. On all union matters, of course, the convention will take its usual conservative position. On the war, it will come out 100% for the Roosevelt war program.
And on the question of Negro rights in the labor movement, the craft union convention will make its usual evasions.
They will permit A. Philip Randolph, Negro leader of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, and a few others to make some speeches demanding an end to Negro discrimination in the AFL, and they will permit the introduction of resolutions advocating steps to provide equal rights for Negro workers – but the Negro will still be Jim Crowed by a large section of the AFL after the convention is over.
They may pass a resolution deploring discrimination in industry, as the recent New York State Federation of Labor convention did, but they themselves won’t take a single step to help Negroes to get into factories or unions where they are now barred.
For the truth is that the fat, well-paid heads of the AFL have no interest in the Negro workers; any more than they have in most unskilled workers. And they will refuse to do anything that would bring a protest from the lily-white leaders of the southern unions – just as Roosevelt refuses to do anything that would bring a protest from the lily-white poll tax politicians who run the Democratic party and everything else in the South.
An interesting thing to note about this is that the craft union heads use the same excuses that Roosevelt does in ignoring and fostering Jim Crowism. The poll taxers screech about “local autonomy” and “states rights” in fighting against anti-lynch bills and anti-poll tax legislation. And the white supremacy gang in the AFL also cries out about “local autonomy” and “the rights of the individual internationals in opposing, all resolutions and constitutional proposals to wipe out Jim Crowism in the AFL.
These aristocrats of the working class will not change the sections of their constitution providing for equal treatment of all workers regardless of race or color, which have been on the books for decades, but neither they will change anything else to put meaning and life info those words.
 

The Latest “Solution”
After Private Ned Turman was murdered by a southern white MP at Fort Bragg on August 6, an angry protest arose against the brutal treatment of Negroes in the Army. Action was promised in Washington, especially by the Negro aide to the Secretary of War, Judge William H. Hastie. Last week, the action was finally taken, and announced by Hastie himself in the course of a speech made at the dedication of a new Army recreation camp for Negroes at Anacostia, D.C.
From now on, says Hastie, there will be Negro MPs, or to be more accurate, there will be more Negro MPs. Only this and nothing more!
By this I do not mean that we, who stand for equality for the Negroes, are opposed to having Negro MPs in the Army. Of course we want to see Negroes have the right to hold any job from which they are barred. We have no use for the Democratic or Republican party which both betray the Negro people every chance they get. But we stand for the right of Negroes within those parties to hold any post or office.
Similarly with Negro MPs. We do not support the boss war nor do we support the boss army. But we insist that every Negro in the army have the same rights as white soldiers.
We do not oppose the appointment of Negroes as MPs, but when anyone comes around and says that the appointment of Negroes as MPs is the solution of the problem of brutal, discriminatory treatment of the Negroes in the Army, then we can only say that he is a liar or a fool. And we would add that such a person is in favor of appointing Negros MPs not because he is interested in getting equal rights for Negroes to serve as MPs just as white soldiers do, but because he is interested in covering up and hiding and excusing the brutal discrimination of Negro soldiers.
In the first place, we will ask, will the Negro soldiers be any better off if they are beaten up and driven around by Negro MPs acting on the instructions and orders of Negro-hating white officers than if they are ill-treated by white MPs?
Will those white MPs who like to mistreat Negro soldiers act any differently toward them just because there are more Negro MPs?
The truth is that the MPs are not the forces primarily responsible for this brutality toward the Negro soldiers. They are only a small part of a big system of Jim Crowism in the armed forces fostered by the war administration.
As long as Roosevelt segregates the Negroes in the Army, backward white soldiers will be encouraged, even where they are not specifically advised, to look down on the Negroes and consider them “inferior.” That is what segregation leads to inevitably.
When you stop to think of it, you can see that Hastie advises the use of Negro MPs for the same reason that he himself is used in the War Department. In this Department, he acts as the “Negro front” and gives a protective coloration to its Jim Crow policies. Now he wants Negro MPs to play the same role for the Army itself.
The answer to Jim Crow brutality is the fight for mixed regiments and an end to all forms of segregation. This means a fight not only against Roosevelt but against Judases like Judge Hastie.
 



Editor:
I would like to call your attention to a mistake in the editorial entitled Whitewashing Jim Crow in the October 18 issue of The Militant.
In this editorial you declared that “while Elliot was dismissed from command of Fort Bragg, he was not dismissed from the army. He was only transferred another fort, where he will be able to continue to carry out the same practices and policies he carried out at Bragg."
Colonel Elliot, who was in command at Fort Bragg the night of the shooting of Ned Turman, Negro draftee, and the terror that followed, was transferred from Fort Bragg, but not to another fort. He has been transferred to the job of instructor in the ROTC at Mississippi State College.
I make this correction in the interests of exactness, and not because I have any disagreement with the main point in your editorial.
For even if Elliot had been dishonorably discharged from the army, rather than transferred to a minor post, it would still be true that this is no “victory for Negro rights” as the Stalinists pretend. Elliot was only carrying out the official Jim Crow policy of the army, and he was dismissed to cover up the fact that this Jim Crow policy is maintained on orders from the White House itself. Regardless of who took Elliot’s place, the Negro soldiers at Bragg will still be segregated and discriminated against.

Editor:
A number of the comrades here in Newark, in an informal discussion of the Appeal’s articles on Coughlin, came to the following suggestion:
We don’t think it enough to merely characterize Coughlin as an anti-Semite and a fascist. What is much more important is a series of articles analyzing his program, explaining that Coughlin exploits the sentiments of the masses against their own interests, how their discontent with unemployment, war, fascism and an inadequate standard of living is used by him to answer that to end these things one must kill the Jews. On each major social problem, one should show that Coughlin has no real program. Then, in contrast, our own transitional program should be set forth, showing the difference between Coughlin and a working class party’s program. The way to arouse the most effective agitation, we believe, is by contrasting his program with ours, and calling upon the workers to choose between them.

Editor:
I strongly disagree with Joseph Hansen’s review of the final volume of Isaac Deutscher’s biography of Trotsky (ISR, Winter 1964). Although Comrade Hansen lists many of the points on which Deutscher is wrong and misleading, and answers some of them, he is on the whole too soft, too conciliatory An example of what I object to is his footnote about Deutscher’s reference in The Prophet Outcast to an attack on his views by James P. Cannon in 1954. Hansen attempts to “clear this up” in the following way:
“Some harsh and even unjustified things were said of Deutscher.” His explanation is that “at the time Deutscher’s theory about the possibility of the self-reform of the Stalinist bureaucracy figured in an internal crisis of the Socialist Workers Party.” A minority, which eventually split away, was strongly influenced by Deutscher’s theory.
“To many Trotskyists, Deutscher’s position appeared as an alternative program which could be a bridge to Stalinism. It therefore was viewed with hostility. It turned out, however, that Deutscher was not interested in recruiting from the Trotskyist movement or in organizing a sect of his own, still less a cult. This spoke strongly in his favor.”
After the Hungarian uprising, Hansen continues, “another phenomenon” became noticeable. Many Communist Party members, still afraid to read Trotsky’s writings, began to read Deutscher. “Having begun dipping into Trotskyism in this way, they thirsted for more. Through Deutscher, some of them eventually found their way to Trotskyism.” Thus Deutscher’s position proved to be “a bridge from Stalinism to Trotskyism. Trotskyists could not be against that kind of public facility. They therefore began undertaking their own self-reform – in relation to Deutscher.”
 
Deutscher and the Cochranites
But it is simply not true that “harsh things” said about Deutscher in our press can be attributed to the undoubted fact that the Cochranite minority of the Socialist Workers Party embraced Deutscher’s views in 1953. That embrace and its consequences were the main reason why Cannon attacked Deutscher’s position at that time, as he himself pointed out (Fourth International, Winter 1954), but harsh things had been written about Deutscher long before then. In 1949, when his Stalin biography appeared, I wrote two articles in The Militant sharply condemning it, despite its positive features, for its false analysis of the Stalinist bureaucracy as fundamentally progressive. This had nothing whatever to do with any internal situation in the SWP.
In 1953, The Militant printed two more articles by me on the development of Deutscher’s ideas after Stalin’s death (in Russia: What Next?). By this time Deutscherism was an internal issue, but I would have written exactly the same criticism if it hadn’t been. In the spring of 1954, when the first volume of Deutscher’s Trotsky biography appeared, the Cochranites had broken with revolutionary Marxism completely and were no longer of interest to me. But The Militant printed six more articles by me on the pernicious errors and distortions of Deutscher. They were harsh, all right, but I cannot find anything unjustified in them, even ten years later; and I see that I correctly predicted then just what position Deutscher would take now in the final volume on the formation of the Fourth International.
Hansen now makes it appear that our common hostility to Deutscher 10 and 15 years ago was based on a belief that he was interested in “recruiting” Trotskyists to a sect or cult of his own. This was never my opinion at that time, nor did I hear of anyone expressing such an idea until, after the publication of the second volume of the biography in 1959 Hansen began to revise his attitude toward Deutscher. It never occurred to me 10 years ago because, on the face of it, Deutscher was essentially a commentator and bystander. He could not have any interest in recruiting anybody to any organization because he thought and thinks organization is useless or harmful. All he was interested in doing was refuting Trotsky’s ideas, while praising Trotsky was a genius and prophet.
What Deutscher wanted to recruit members of the Fourth International to was not another organization but to the conception that it was a waste of time to build such organizations. Personally, I think it would speak more “strongly in his favor” if he had tried to build an organization to put his ideas into effect, as Trotsky did. In this connection, I do not understand why Hansen finds it “hard to know exactly what Deutscher thinks” Trotsky and his followers should have been doing. Everything Deutscher writes testifies to his belief that Trotsky and his supporters should have been writing against fascism, Stalinism, imperialism, etc., and that’s all. Analysis and propaganda, yes; building a revolutionary party or international, no.
I also have serious reservations about Hansen’s contention that “through Deutscher, some of them (Communist Party members) eventually found their way to Trotskyism.” It is true that some of them found an introduction to Trotsky’s ideas in Deutscher, but in a distorted form. To find “their way to Trotskyism,” they would have had to go around or over Deutscher, not through him, and, in this country at least, few did. For most of them, Deutscher served as a stopping point; as a justification for breaking with Stalinism, but also as a justification for rejecting Trotsky’s conclusion on what to do.
For most readers of the Trotsky biography, I believe, the conclusion will be that Trotsky was a great man but that “Trotskyism” is Utopian and impractical. As a “public facility,” Deutscher is more like a detour or dead end than a bridge, and I not only could be against that kind of facility, but am. If this is what led Hansen to “reform” his attitude to Deutscher, I would recommend that he take another and closer look at where this facility has led most readers.
Finally, I question the use of Hansen’s analogy of Deutscher’s biography of Trotsky with a portrait that might be painted of Trotsky by an artist. (“Let us not ask too much from them (artists), but take gratefully what they can give.”) If Deutscher gives a portrait, that is only incidental. His is a political biography, that is, political analysis, not art (however well Deutscher writes). Perhaps Hansen’s review would have been better if he had treated it primarily as false political analysis rather than as a work of art marred by the obtrusiveness of a gesticulating brush.



 


George Breitman
Detroit, Michigan



 
Joseph Hansen’s Reply








This article comprises the text of a speech
delivered at a midwest educational conference of the Young Socialist
Alliance in Chicago, January 1964 by George Breitman, frequent
contributor to The Militant and author of a number of
pamphlets written for the Socialist Workers Party.




THE year 1963 was the most eventful in the history of
the American Negro struggle. As it ended, people all over the country
were stopping to assess what had happened, to think over what was done
and what was not done, what was accomplished and not accomplished.
Clifton DeBerry, the Socialist Workers party candidate for President
this year, had an opportunity at the end of 1963 to make a
coast-to-coast tour of most big northern cities and to learn something
about the current thinking of Negro militants. He told me one of the
things he had observed was the difficulty in getting across the idea
about how much the Negro people can do even though they are in a
minority, about how much they can do on their own, alone and unaided if
necessary. He noticed this difficulty in speaking with Negro trade
unionists, but not only them. He felt a lot more attention has to be
paid to ways of explaining, in a logical, convincing manner, how much a
minority is capable of accomplishing. He felt that misunderstanding on
this point is one of the reasons why the idea of an all-black political
party has not yet caught on with more Negroes.
Why is it so hard for many Negroes, even militant Negroes, to grasp
the full potential of determined minority action? I would say there are
three reasons:
First, the teaching, the influence, the propaganda of the whole
capitalist system from cradle to grave are aimed at brainwashing the
people; at convincing them, among other things, that minorities can
plead and beg, but cannot do anything significant, cannot accomplish
any big changes, until they have the consent of the majority. Above all
is this idea burned into the minds and souls of Negroes, whose history
is distorted or denied, and who are made to feel not only that they are
a minority, but an insignificant minority, who have never amounted to
much by themselves and who, without the stern supervision or benign
direction of the great white fathers, would hardly know how to flush a
toilet. In other words, for Negroes to comprehend how much a minority
can do they must buck everything drilled into them from the beginning
of childhood; they virtually have to make a revolution in their
thinking.
There is a certain irony in these things taught by the capitalists
because the capitalists are a minority themselves — in fact, a much
smaller minority than the Negro people. Yet this capitalist minority
controls the whole country, lock, stock and barrel — its wealth, its
means of production, its political structure — and therefore is a
living refutation of what it tells us about the limits on what a
minority can accomplish.
The second reason why it is hard to see the truth about what a
minority can do is that the present Negro leadership, almost in its
entirety, is enslaved by the ideas promulgated by the capitalist class,
repeats and spreads those ideas, and does everything in its power to
discourage the mass of the Negro people from taking steps genuinely
independent of the white majority.
A third reason is that the radical movement, virtually the whole
radical movement with the exception of the Socialist Workers party,
although it approaches questions from a different standpoint than that
of the ruling capitalist class, has failed to comprehend the essence of
this question, and instead of promoting and encouraging both
theoretically and practically an understanding of the dynamics and
potential of minority action, in some ways even discourages it. An
example is their attitude toward the Freedom Now Party. I do not know
of a single organization in this country claiming to be Marxist or
socialist or communist that supports the Freedom Now Party, except the
Socialist Workers Party. The Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the
Socialist Labor Party, the Progressive Labor Movement — all are either
flatly opposed to, or feel very uneasy, about the development of an
all-black political party independent of the power structure and of the
two major parties. And if you trace back the causes, you will find them
to be most unMarxist, unsocialist and uncommunist failures to grasp the
revolutionary implications of the independent struggles of the Negro
minority.
 
I WANT now to examine some typical arguments by the
present Negro leaders against such independent action. When the Freedom
Now Party was organized in Michigan a few months ago, the press was
very much concerned about it. And every “big name” Negro who came to
Detroit for several weeks thereafter was immediately buttonholed by the
press and invited to make some statement on, or rather against, the
Freedom Now Party.
One of these was Rev. Martin Luther King, who obliged with the
following statement:
“I am opposed to anything or any party that teaches
separation of the races because I am for integration. If the party is
designed to get more Negroes interested in politics, fine; otherwise I
can see no good that can come from an all-black party. One-tenth of the
population will never be able to dominate nine-tenths.”
In this statement I think Rev. King is guilty of
counterposing “separation of the races” and “integration” in a
completely false and unwarranted way. The Freedom Now Party does not
“teach the separation of the races.” It recognizes that this is a
society where the races are separated in fact, and attempts to utilize
the separation that has been imposed by capitalism in order to change
society and do away with the discrimination made possible by this
imposed separation. King is well aware of this. He is a preacher, the
head of a church which happens to be all-black. He does not reject or
oppose this church because it is all-black. He knows that there is
nothing racist about this church being all-black. It is the result of
living in a racist society. And he works through this all-black church
and tries to build it, at the same time that he advocates integration
and seeks to utilize this all-black organization to promote integration.
Now why can’t an all-black party do the same thing that an all-black
church does, that is, take advantage of the separation created by this
racist society in order to weld together the black victims of racism so
that they can work to end racism altogether? Why not? Why is it
permissible in King’s eyes for Negroes to pray together, but not
permissible for them to join together in political action in the way
they find most effective for ending their oppression? Shouldn’t King,
if he is logical and consistent, propose that Negroes give up their
all-black churches too because they are not integrated? Posed this way,
King could reply, “But we have an all-black church because it’s the
only kind available to us.” And the answer of the Freedom Now Party
could be, “Yes, and an all-black political party is the only kind
available to us that we think has any chance of solving our problems.”
So King is confusing rather than clarifying the real relation between
“separation” and “integration,” which are not necessarily opposites at
all, since the formation of all-black organizations and institutions
may actually be a means of achieving the goal of “integration” instead
of being in contradiction to that goal.
King’s other remark was even more revealing: “One-tenth of the
population will never be able to dominate nine-tenths.” Maybe not,
although I’ve already pointed out that the capitalists, a minority of
less than one per cent, dominate the other 99 per cent of us. Anyhow,
that’s not the issue posed by the Freedom Now Party. It is not the
Freedom Now Party’s goal for the Negro one-tenth to dominate the white
nine-tenths. Just the opposite — its goal is to keep the white
nine-tenths from dominating and oppressing the black one-tenth. How
to do this — that’s the real difference between King and the Freedom
Now Party. Must the minority adapt itself in its methods and tempo to
the prejudiced majority, just because it is a majority, and not do
certain things because the majority will not like it? Or, can the
minority end the domination of the majority by acting with complete
independence from the majority ideologically, organizationally,
politically — and only by acting independently? King prefers
not to discuss this real difference. That’s why he misrepresents his
opponents’ position with irrelevant talk about the inability of
one-tenth to dominate nine-tenths.
 
Randolph’s Position
Another noted figure who came to Detroit at the time
was. A. Philip Randolph, Vice-President of the AFL-CIO and President of
the Negro American Labor Council. He too dutifully came forward with a
statement against the Freedom Now Party, from which I’ll read just the
first two sentences:
“Racial isolation in any form cannot register any
influence on American political events. It is completely foreign to the
political thoughts and actions of America.”
It could be pointed out that what Randolph calls “racial
isolation,” in the form of all-white organizations like the Ku Klux
Klan and the White Citizens Council, has registered plenty of influence
on American politics. But I think it may be more useful to stress that
in his eagerness to damn the Freedom Now Party, Randolph here is really
damning himself. By “racial isolation” he means all-black organization
for the purpose of ending the isolation foisted on Negroes by a racist
society. Randolph is so blinded factionally that he has forgotten his
own role, the thing for which he will probably be best remembered; for
it so happens that next to Marcus Garvey and Elijah Muhammad, Randolph
is the American Negro leader who did the most in this century for what
he now calls “racial isolation,” that is, all-black organization.
The first March on Washington Movement, which Randolph organized in
1941, was all-black, and Randolph was foremost in insisting that it be
all-black. Even though it did not materialize in a march, because
Randolph yielded to Roosevelt and called it off at the last minute,
that first call for a March on Washington in 1941 nevertheless
accomplished more than the interracial march that took place last
August, because it forced Roosevelt to issue the first FEPC order,
which is more than the 1963 march accomplished. Instead of “isolating”
the Negro struggle, I think it can be said that that all-black
organization, small and imperfect though it was, did more to influence
American life than any interracial movement has done since.
* * *
HOW do you influence the course of events anyway? Is it done by
strict adherence to the procedures and forms approved by the forces in
power, or by following the rules they lay down? All experience,
American as well as “foreign,” testifies to the contrary. As long as
you abide by their rules, either in the way you organize or the way you
fight, they know they have little to fear from you and pay you little
attention. The only valid test for all-black organization is this: does
it at this time and under these circumstances help or hinder in
mobilizing the masses for uncompromising struggle? It doesn’t matter if
whites, liberal or conservative, don’t like it and call it all kinds of
names. What counts is what the black masses think about it. If they
think it is good, if it enables them more effectively to organize for
struggle, then it can have a shattering impact on present-day American
society and politics. Influence can be wielded in more ways than one,
and that which helps the masses to organize is most “influential” in
the long run.
I will cite only one more example of the kind of reasoning employed
by Negro opponents of independent minority action. Also attacking the
Freedom Now Party was Alex Fuller, Vice-President of the Detroit
AFL-CIO Council. He said:
“We can continue to make gains only by working with
people of good will. It is a serious mistake when minority groups, now
on the threshold of making tremendous gains for Negroes ... separate
themselves from others who are working for the same objectives ... We
cannot afford to separate or isolate ourselves ... We stand on the side
of all democratic-thinking people who believe and advocate first-class
citizenship for everyone. We cannot do it alone.”
Translated, what Alex Fuller means is this: Negroes
can’t get anywhere, Negroes can’t get anything, unless they remain in
the Democratic party; therefore they must wait until the Democrats are
ready. But the truth is somewhat different. Negroes will never get
first-class citizenship in a thousand years so long as their political
power remains tucked away in the vest pocket of the Democratic party.
If they have to depend on and wait for the Democrats or the
Republicans, and similar “people of good will,” their children and
their children’s children will never know the taste of freedom.
Nobody in his right mind wants to separate “from others who are
working for the same objectives,” but it is a lie to pretend that the
Democratic party, any more than the Republican Party, has the “same
objectives” as the Negro people. If that were the case the present
massive Negro revolt would have no purpose or meaning. The objective of
the major parties is to quiet the Negroes with a few token concessions,
while the objective of the Negro people is freedom.
Surely there’s a difference here, and it is just this big difference
that separates Negroes from Fuller’s “democratic-thinking people.”
Negroes want freedom now, and “democratic-thinking people” want them to
have it later. The only way Negroes can prevent “separation” from the
liberals on this issue is to give in to them and let them decide when
and where and how much freedom Negroes shall have. That’s what Alex
Fuller and the other Negro leaders have done and what they want the
Negro people to do or keep on doing. But the tendency favoring the
Freedom Now party has decided that a hundred years of political
dependence on these democratic-thinking people of good will is enough,
because such dependence, far from bringing them to “the threshold of
tremendous gains,” will lead only to another hundred years of the same.
They have made their declaration of political independence, and now
they are striking out on their own, determined to use their political
power for themselves first, last, and all the time.

 
Characteristics of Negro Minority
Before proceeding to our examination from a Marxist
point of view of how much and not how little a minority can do, I
should make clear that I am not talking about just any minority, but
about a minority with certain characteristics, certain features, and a
certain history. And also, yes, I am talking about a minority of a
certain size. Let me get the size question out of the way first.
Obviously, not every minority is big enough to do the things I am
talking about. Size is important too. If there were only two or three
million Negroes in this country, which is approaching a population of
200 million, they could not accomplish what a minority of 20 million
can. But 20 million is a big force, big enough to tear things up, big
enough and weighty enough to appreciably affect the course of events.
After all, how many countries in the world, not only the new ones in
Africa and Asia but also the old ones in Europe and the Americas, have
a population of 20 million? Out of more than 100 countries, not more
than 25 at the most, so that around three-quarters of the countries in
the world are smaller in population than the Negro people of the United
States.
Size and relative weight are not the only important factors to be
considered. A minority of even 40 million cannot do much if satisfied
with its conditions or indifferent and apathetic about them. As
important as size, or more important, in deciding what a minority can
do are social, economic, political, historical, and psychological
factors.
What I am trying to say is that what a minority can do depends on
whether or not it is oppressed and exploited because of some minority
trait or feature, is separated out by society for special inferior
status, is denied equal treatment, opportunity and rights; whether or
not it is at the bottom of the social ladder so that when it rises it
shakes the whole structure; whether or not it is a part of the most
productive and potentially most powerful force in the modern world, the
working class, and yet at the same time is denied the full benefits of
membership in that class; whether or not the oppressive and
exploitative society in which it exists is stable or in crisis,
challenged on all sides and therefore no longer able to maintain the status
quo; whether or not this minority believes that it can take
advantage of the crisis of society; whether or not it is affected by
and responds to the great tides of change and revolution sweeping the
globe and has a sense of kinship and solidarity with the masses rising
up and changing the rest of the world; whether or not its oppression
tends to knit it together for common action and goals; whether or not
it is compact and so situated geographically that it can act with
maximum cohesive-ness and impact; whether or not it has learned to see
through the brainwashing which the ruling class uses to keep this
minority in subjugation; whether or not it has lost patience as well as
respect for the majority; whether or not it sees any further reason to
continue believing in promises or in gradualism; whether or not it has
the capacity to free itself from the influence of conservative leaders
who have always held it back and to replace them with more militant and
revolutionary leaders; whether or not it realizes it never has made any
gains except by fighting for them; whether or not it has the capacity
to defend itself against terror and violence; whether or not it is
developing a militant and radical consciousness, ideology, philosophy
and methodology of its own that can motivate and spark sustained,
audacious and independent struggle.
In short, I am talking about characteristics that fit the American
Negro people or which they are in the process of acquiring at an
extremely rapid rate. Of the many things such a minority can do, I
shall now list some, not necessarily in the order of their importance:
 
What a Minority Can Do
1. It can force serious concessions from the ruling
class. Anyone who expects the capitalist class to grant full and
genuine equality to the Negro people is going to be sadly disappointed,
because equality is simply not compatible with, or possible under, a
social system of the type that we have in the United States today. But
that is no reason for Negroes to stop trying to get whatever they can
squeeze out of the ruling class until the time comes when it can be
deposed. Militant struggle can force the present ruling class to lift
some of the existing racial restrictions and barriers in the form of
more rights more jobs, better jobs, better schools, better housing,
less police brutality, and a greater measure of formal equality before
the law. Negroes will not settle for such partial gains and
concessions, but they would be fools not to fight for them and take
them and utilize them to press for other and more fundamental changes.
 
2. A minority, properly oriented and led, can go much
farther than it has thus far gone to make the present system unworkable
and intolerable. Bayard Rustin calls this “social dislocation” (and
warns against its “limitations”). Rev. Albert Cleage, chairman of the
Freedom Now Party in Michigan, calls it “a strategy of chaos” (and
urges its application be expanded). Others give it the name of “mass
civil disobedience.” Whatever you call it, it has barely been utilized
in America up to now. It consists of making the system so inconvenient
and expensive that white people will be forced to ask themselves
whether continued discrimination is worthwhile and whether in their own
interest they should not help to do away with it altogether.
It means lying down, interposing your bodies on the airport runways,
on the expressways, at the plant gate, at the school entrance, at the
bank, at the points of production, and the points of distribution, and
the points of transportation, and throwing a monkey wrench into the
wheels of the system, attempting to paralyze it, to bring it to a stop.
It means saying:
“If we Negroes can’t have decent and equal schools,
then let’s not have any schools. If we can’t have jobs and job
equality, then let no one be able to work. If we can’t vote, then let
no one be able to vote. If we can’t belong to the unions as equals,
then we don’t care what happens to the unions.”
It means carrying the principle of the sit-down strike,
which stops production, much farther and into entirely new areas of
social life.
I say that this has hardly been exercised as a full-scale weapon of
the Negro minority, but I have no doubt that it will be. Already some
members of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, headed by
Diane Nash Bevel, have proposed such action and have had it rejected by
moderate leaders like Rev. King, who talks about civil disobedience but
is mortally afraid of really unleashing it without restriction on a
mass scale. The sit-ins, the lie-ins, the wade-ins, etc., were just a
small, faint, preliminary version of what is still to come in a giant
size and to the accomplishment of deep social convulsions and
conflicts. To avoid misunderstanding, let me say that what I am talking
about here is not pacifism but an all out struggle, which will be the
equivalent of a general strike when it reaches full flower. And a
general strike usually tends to pose questions about who shall have
power in the land.
 
3. A minority can, merely by carrying through its fight
for democratic rights without compromise, help to educate and
radicalize the American people, especially the youth in whose hands the
future lies. In fact, it is already doing so. You in this audience of
young socialists and young radicals know better than anyone else how
profoundly your thinking about the whole world has been influenced by
the Negro struggle; how their fight for equality enabled you to see
through the official myths about “democracy” and “the free world,” to
understand the brute reality of the capitalist power structure, to
reach new conclusions about capitalism and socialism. Not only the
Cuban revolution, not only the danger of atomic war, but something much
closer to home, the Negro revolt, has helped to educate or re-educate
you, to shed the blinders of liberalism, and to persuade you to
dedicate your lives to the fight for a better world. In this respect
you are not so much unique as early, because the deepening struggle of
the Negro minority will have similarly healthy effects on other young
people and on some of the not completely hopeless older people as well.

 
4. A minority not only can educate other forces but can
set them into motion too. It can stimulate them to fight for their own
needs and interests through the power of example as well as the power
of pressure. You heard one illustration of the power of example this
morning — the report about the rent strike which began among Negroes in
Harlem and is now spreading to some white sections of the population in
other parts of New York City. Another small but striking example
occurred in Detroit last summer. A militant Negro demonstration in
front of police headquarters, to protest the police shooting of a young
Negro woman in the back, came to the very brink of a physical clash.
That was a Saturday, and it was followed two days later, on Monday, by
another demonstration at another police station, near which cops had
shot a young white man in the back. This second demonstration,
involving mainly young whites, raised the same slogans as the first
and culminated in a pitched battle with the cops after the youths had
thrown rocks and bottles at them. Not long ago I noticed a small
newspaper item about some airline strike pickets who had been picketing
up and down outside the Newark terminal for a long time, with little
public attention paid to their grievances. One day they suddenly
decided to go inside the terminal and demonstrate there, which was
prohibited by an injunction. Quickly arrested, they were asked what had
got into them. Their explanation was that they had seen that Negroes
were able to get action by sit-ins and by going places where they
weren’t supposed to, so they thought it was a good idea to do the same.
These are all small-scale illustrations, but bigger and better ones
are in the offing. The rulers of this country are well aware of the
stimulation-and-contagion effects of militant Negro struggle. That is
one reason why they want to stop it before it goes too far and explains
the hasty turnabout that induced the previously indifferent Kennedy
administration to suddenly introduce civil rights legislation last year.
 
5. A determined minority can also divide the majority,
can actually split it up at decisive moments and junctures. This, of
course, is one of the best ways of reducing the disadvantages of being
a numerical minority, because it drastically changes the odds against
the minority. The Socialist Workers party’s 1963 convention resolution [1] showed how this process has
operated historically. If our analysis and theory are correct, this
isn’t a matter of history only, but of the present and the future. Let
me refer briefly to the Civil War as an example of the process which
can split the majority.
 
THE Civil War was not just a conflict between abstract
and impersonal forces, between Northern capitalism and Southern
slavery; it was a struggle between classes and living people. No one
played a greater role in stimulating and progressively resolving that
conflict than the slaves and ex-slaves. Again and again in the three
decades before the Civil War the rulers of the North and the South
decided to avoid a final showdown by compromising over the slave
question. Great hopes were raised and brilliant reputations were made
overnight by these eminently “reasonable” negotiations and agreements
reached over the bargaining table in Congress and then enacted into
law. But the slaves were not consulted about these great compromises.
They would not have consented to them anyway, because they left the
condition of the slave unchanged, that is, intolerable. So the slaves
continued their own independent efforts to become free, just as if
these great compromise agreements had never existed.
They continued, just as before, or more so, to run away by the
thousands and tens of thousands, to commit sabotage and arson, and to
engage in various forms of civil disobedience, self-defense and
insurrection. These independent actions of the slaves helped to prevent
the compromises from working and to stimulate the birth and growth of
abolitionism among whites, who threw their weight onto the scales
against further compromise. Thus the slaves reopened and widened the
gap between the South and the North every time the great compromise
statesmen tried to close it.
By acting in every way they could to defend and liberate themselves,
the slaves drove a wedge between the slaveholders and those who wanted
to compromise with the slaveholders. By acting in self-interest, and
alone when they had to, the slaves divided the whites politically and
morally and deepened the divisions to the breaking point. That, above
everything else, is what made the struggle irrepressible, constantly
widened the breach and deepened the division among the whites, and led
inexorably to civil warfare. And then, at the crucial moment, after the
outbreak of the war the rulers on both sides had tried so hard to
avert, the Negroes pressured the northern government into accepting a
revolutionary emancipation policy and completed the process by
providing what the reluctant Lincoln later admitted was the military
balance of power in the war itself. All this happened without a
conscious plan, you might say instinctively. Imagine what will happen
when the Negro militants absorb this lesson from history and then
consciously work out a strategy to fully utilize this process that is
set in motion by the elemental desire of the masses to be free!
We can expect, we can be certain, that the deepening of the Negro
struggle for equality will have similarly divisive effects on the white
majority in our own time. The majority is not homogeneous anyway; it is
strained and torn and in conflict over a thousand questions of policy
and class interest. A skillful leadership of the Negro minority will
know how to pick the right place to drive new wedges, to deepen already
existing and potential differences among the whites, to sharpen their
conflicts, to set them fighting each other, and, in the process, as the
SWP 1963 convention resolution also says, to find mutually beneficial
alliances with those classes and forces whose interests are closer to
those of the Negroes against those forces that are most hostile to the
Negroes.
Under certain conditions, therefore, a minority, just by fighting
for its own rights, can divide the majority into two or more minorities
locked in combat with each other. This in turn can result in bringing
to power a different kind of majority, not based on color, in which the
original minority can take a leading part.
Those who confine themselves to scratching the surface can see only
the limitations of being a minority, which leads to lamentation,
pessimism, and self-induced paralysis or subservience. But when we
examine the situation in all of its complex and contradictory reality,
probing it deeper and from all sides; when we study majority-minority
relations in motion as well as when they are standing still; when we
perceive that the majority has problems too, and weaknesses, and many
points at which it is vulnerable and susceptible to successful attack,
and that these majority problems and weaknesses are becoming more acute
than ever before, then we find, not just limitations for the minority,
but also infinitely varied and promising openings and opportunities for
transforming, transcending, and overcoming limitations.
 
6. The Negro minority is also in a position to upset the
whole political structure of this country — just by “going it alone” in
politics, just by the decisions Negroes make about how to use their own
votes and their own minority political strength. Our 1963 convention
resolution explored this question too, before the present Freedom Now
party was started, but it bears restatement because it is such an
effective refutation of black liberals who contend the Negro is
politically impotent and “destined to fail” if he acts on his own in
politics.
Negroes can form their own party. Negroes can run their own
candidates against the Democrats and Republicans. Negroes, because they
are already a majority in many districts, thanks to the segregated
housing system that jams them tightly together in the big city ghettos,
can, right now or any time they form their own party, elect dozens of
black candidates to Congress from these districts and hundreds of state
and local representatives. In this way they can get representatives in
public office who will be responsible and accountable to the Negro
community instead of to the corrupt major party machines. And since
this bloc of black representatives will not be small, it will enable
them to hold and wield a certain legislative balance of power and to
compel bigger concessions from the power structure than the tokens and
crumbs they are now thrown; all of this, you notice, without any
drastic change yet in political relations — just by taking advantage of
the political and electoral conditions created by segregation, by
refusing to vote Democratic or Republican, by voting black. This would
mark a real advance at least in the number and quality of Negro
representatives in office, but that would be only a part of the result
of independent political action.
By forming their own party, Negroes can paralyze the Democratic
party and rock the whole political structure to its foundations.
Without Negro votes, the bell will toll the doom of the Democratic
party. Without Negro votes, the Democratic coalition with the labor
movement will be undermined and destroyed. Without Negro votes for that
coalition, the unions will be forced to reconsider their political
orientation, and this will encourage and strengthen the union forces
who will eventually form an independent labor party. Without Negro
votes, the present two-party system will pass from the scene and be
replaced by something different, out of which Negroes may be able to
acquire new and more reliable allies than up to now. And all of this
can be accomplished by the simple device of forming a Negro party and
running independent Negro candidates. Really, when you think about the
potential, you can almost pity the ignorance of those Negro leaders who
preach that Negroes are incapable of any political role other than
tagging along behind the liberals.

 
7. The last on my partial list of things the Negro
minority can do should be of special interest to another and smaller
minority — socialists, white and Negro. I am convinced that if militant
Negroes, not yet socialist, are not so concerned with this point now,
they will be later, as their continuing political experience draws it
to their attention. At any rate, my point is that the Negro people,
although a minority, can, with consistently revolutionary leadership,
lead the American working class in the revolution that will abolish
capitalism.
We have long held the view that while the Negro struggle is the
struggle of an oppressed minority for democratic rights, for equality,
it tends, because the masters of this country are both unwilling and
unable to grant equality, to become part of the general movement of the
exploited and oppressed to abolish capitalism and proceed toward
socialism. In this tendency to pass over from democratic to socialist
goals, to pass beyond the capitalist framework that now envelops it,
the Negro struggle is similar to the colonial struggles, which also
take off from democratic aims, such as independence and
self-government, but find themselves unable to attain those democratic
aims until they wrench the imperialist boot from off their neck. The
Chinese call this process the “uninterrupted revolution,” and Leon
Trotsky called it “the permanent revolution.” But that is not what I am
discussing here. What I am talking about now is something else — the
capacity of the Negro people to lead the working-class revolution to
replace capitalism with socialism.
To grasp this idea we must rid our minds of the conception that any
social revolution in general or any working-class revolution in
particular has to be led by a majority. I will try to
illustrate this by going back to the first victorious workers’
revolution, the Russian revolution of 1917. It was victorious because
it had the support of a majority of the Russian people. But
it was not led by any class, or by any vanguard of a class, that
comprised the majority of the population. It was a revolution supported
by the majority, and it could not have succeeded without that
majority support, but it was led by a party that represented a
class that was a minority of the country.
We call it, and it was, a working-class revolution. But out of 150
million people in Russia in 1917 the workers were a small minority.
There were probably no more than 10 million workers, and that included
agricultural workers, some of whom were workers only part of the time.
Counting their families, they made up about 15 or 16 per cent of the
total population. Yet this class, with a proper leadership in the form
of Lenin’s Bolshevik party, was able to lead a revolution that
abolished capitalism in Russia.
This is one of the things that befuddled and ruined the Mensheviks,
the Social Democrats, and other white liberals of that day. As they
understood Marx’s analysis of the conditions needed for social
revolution, it could not take place and should not even be attempted
until the country was industrialized to the point where the working
class was a majority of the population, as in England then or in the
United States today. And if it was attempted before the workers were a
majority of the population, it was, according to these people, bound to
fail. And they were so sure the Russian revolution was not according to
either Hoyle or Marx that most of them pitched in and did their utmost
to make it fail.
But they misunderstood Marx and Marxism, as fortunately Lenin,
Trotsky, and others did not. A socialist revolution can be led by the
working class even when the working class is a minority, provided that
working-class minority can get an alliance with, and support from,
other non-capitalist forces and classes in the country. In Russia this
meant an alliance with the peasants, who constituted around
seventy-five per cent of the country. The working-class minority was
able to lead the Russian revolution and lead it to victory, not only
because it took advantage of the crisis of the capitalist class in the
war, not only because it had a qualified leadership, but also because
it worked out an effective alliance with the most oppressed sections of
the peasants. This alliance was designed to meet the most pressing
demands of the peasants, but it did not make any concessions to them
about the need to throw the capitalists out of power; and it was based,
first of all, on the needs and interests of the working class minority,
because the workers were the backbone of the revolution, the most
revolutionary force in the country, and represented the historic march
of social progress.
Now why, in discussing the American revolution of the 1960’s and
1970’s, have I gone all the way back to 1917 and far-off Russia? I did
so because I thought it would throw light on the distinction between
the making of a revolution and the leading of a
revolution, on the leading role that a minority can play, on how dogma
can blind one to the leading role of a minority, and on how the
successful leadership of a working-class revolution by a minority class
depends partly on its ability to make alliances with other exploited
classes and groups. I know I am not proving anything about America by
this reference to Russia, but perhaps it can help us to look at the
role of revolutionary minorities in a fresh way.
The working-class revolution has to be led by workers through their
independent party, or parties, or councils. That’s one of the things
Marx taught us. But Marx never said anything about the revolution
having to be led by white workers. He only said by workers — by the
most revolutionary workers. The Negroes in this country are a racial
minority, but that is only one of their aspects. It would be truly
fatal to forget their other primary aspect, namely, that in their
overwhelming majority they are proletarian in composition. In fact,
Negroes are more proletarian than whites in this country. Negroes are
an important section of the working class as well as a racial minority.
Unless we are blind, we must see that they are at present and will
probably remain the most radicalized section of the working class, the
section of the working class that has the most to gain and nothing to
lose from social revolution. If this is true, then why should it be so
hard, when we are discussing what a radical minority of the working
class can do, to conceive of the possibility that it may lead the rest
of the working class and its allies in the revolution that will abolish
capitalism?
As a matter of fact, that is just what Leon Trotsky, who did so much
to rescue authentic Marxism for my generation and yours, was trying to
teach us twenty-five years ago when we set out to reach a correct and
revolutionary analysis of the Negro struggle. Things were different in
1933, before the CIO, and in 1939, long before the current
radicalization of the Negro people. But let me read you some things
Trotsky told us in the 1930’s [2]

and see if they do not apply with even greater validity and relevance
to the changed conditions of the 1960’s. My first quotation is from a
discussion in Turkey between Trotsky and an American, thirty-one years
ago, at the depth of the depression and before the CIO was formed.
English was not Trotsky’s native tongue, and his English was not too
good, but his ideas were. He was talking, in 1933, about what would
happen when a mass radicalization began in America, and he said:
“I believe that by the unheard-of political and
theoretical backwardness and the unheard-of economic advance the
awakening of the working class will proceed quite rapidly. The old
ideological covering will burst, all questions will emerge at once and
since the country is so economically mature the adaptation of the
political and theoretical to the economic level will be achieved very
rapidly. It is then possible that the Negroes will become the most
advanced section. We have already a similar example in Russia. The
Russians were the European Negroes. It is very possible that the
Negroes also through the self-determination will proceed to the
proletarian dictatorship in a couple of gigantic strides, ahead of the
great bloc of white workers. They will then furnish the vanguard. I am
absolutely sure that they will in any case fight better than the white
workers. That, however, can happen only if the communist party carries
on an uncompromising merciless struggle not against the supposed
national prepossessions of the Negroes but against the colossal
prejudices of the white workers and gives it no concession whatever.”
That was 1933. Six years later, in 1939, Trotsky
discussed the Negro struggle with another delegation from the United
States, and, touching on the conditions that make workers conservative
or radical, he said:
“If the workers’ aristocracy is the basis of
opportunism, one of the sources of adaptation to capitalist society,
then the most oppressed and discriminated against are the most dynamic
milieu of the working class. We must say to the conscious elements of
the Negroes that they are convoked by the historic development to
become a vanguard of the working class. What serves as a brake on the
higher strata? It is the privileges, the comforts that hinder them from
becoming revolutionists. It does not exist for the Negroes. What can
transform a certain stratum, make it more capable of courage and
sacrifice? It is concentrated in the Negroes. If it happens that we in
the SWP are not able to find a road to this stratum, then we are not
worthy at all. The permanent revolution and all the rest would be only
a lie.”
 
LET me repeat just three of those statements now: It is
“possible that the Negroes will become the most advanced section.”
It is possible that the Negroes “will proceed to the proletarian
dictatorship ... ahead of the great bloc of white workers.”
“The Negroes are convoked by the historic development to become a
vanguard of the working class.” What Trotsky was trying to get us
to understand twenty-five and thirty years ago, it is plain, was the
possibility that the Negroes could lead the working-class revolution.
Our party tried to understand this and to express it in the very first
resolution on the Negro struggle it ever adopted, which made it the
first party ever to put this idea forward. Let me read the first two
sentences of that resolution, which is reprinted in full in Documents
on the Negro Struggle, and which was adopted by the Socialist
Workers party convention in 1939:
“The American Negroes, for centuries the most
oppressed section of American society and the most discriminated
against, are potentially the most revolutionary element of the
population. They are designated by their whole historical past to be,
under adequate leadership, the very vanguard of the proletarian
revolution.”
So what I have been trying to say, in stating that the
black minority can lead the white majority of the working class in the
coming social revolution, is not really new, because the Socialist
Workers party explicitly stated that concept in a formal convention
resolution in 1939, before most of the people in this hall were born.
Then why does it seem new to many of us? Because, I am sorry to say,
there can be a big gap between accepting or even repeating an idea in a
general way as logically correct, and grasping in all of its
concreteness a profound truth that flies in the face of all prevailing
opinion and prejudice, absorbing it and making it a part of you, a
central part of your thought and your action. There is also a
considerable difference between accepting a general proposition that
may turn out to be correct at some indefinite future time and accepting
it as a possibility, or even a probability, that can have the most
far-reaching consequences for you right now or in the near future.
Although in 1939 we accepted the idea that the Negro minority can
lead the working-class revolution and readily adopted that as the
official position of the Socialist Workers party, the truth is that it
was only a surface acceptance and adoption. We were not yet ready,
despite what we put in our resolution, to fully understand what Trotsky
was trying to get us to see. And six or seven weeks after our 1939
convention adopted this resolution, J.R. Johnson, the chairman of our
party’s committee on Negro work at that time, who had been under
Trotsky’s influence the chief author of the resolution, wrote in our
paper an article referring to the resolution. Johnson said that while
the idea in the resolution was correct, and while “the place of the
Negro is in the very front,” nevertheless the formulation in the
resolution was an “overstatement.” Instead of saying that the Negroes
are destined to be “the very vanguard,” he wrote, it would have been
more correct to say that they are destined to be “in the very
vanguard.” This was a real weakening of the idea Trotsky had tried to
persuade us of. Although it left the Socialist Workers party with the
most advanced position on the Negro struggle, it was a definite step
backward.
But now, with Trotsky long dead, I think we are able to return to
that original unweakened idea and see it in an entirely different light
— not as an overstatement, but as a cold, hard, factually correct
appraisal of a vital possibility that can crucially affect the future
of all Americans. Because what Trotsky could not teach us completely we
have now been able to learn from the actual development of the Negro
struggle itself right before our own eyes these last two or three
years. What we were not advanced enough in the 1930’s to accept as
theory, we are now able to apprehend as concrete current event. Because
the fact is that the Negroes are already a vanguard. They are already
out in front of most white workers. They are more radicalized than the
white workers. They are more ready to fight and sacrifice and die in
order to change this system.
And so today many of us, I am sure, will be able to grasp and act on
the concept of Negroes as leaders of the workers’ revolution not just
as a possibility but as a probability. I shall not try, because that is
a job for the whole movement, to work out or complete everything that
flows from this concept, except to say that much does, and that all of
it seems to me a cause for optimism. Nor shall I try here to discuss
the kind of alliance I think the Negro vanguard of the working-class
revolution will have to effect with the advanced section of the white
workers if the revolution is to be led to success, except to say that I
do not think it can be an alliance that will make concessions in
principle to the white allies of the Negroes, any more than the
revolutionary vanguard in Russia sacrificed any principles in their
alliance with the peasants. Instead, I shall conclude, with much left
hanging, by saying that if the ideas in this talk are correct, if the
concepts about what a minority can do will be of practical and
theoretical benefit in advancing the Negro struggle for freedom, then
what they demonstrate is the validity and even the indispensability of
Marxism to Negro revolutionists, whether or not they belong to the
Socialist Workers Party.
