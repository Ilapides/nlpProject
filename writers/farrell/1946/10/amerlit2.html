<h3>II.</h3>

<p class="fst">In the past, American businessmen as a whole did not have a great
interest in or need for culture. Today, this is changing. Culture has
become an important field of investment. Culture, and pseudo
substitutes for culture, have now been socially organized on the
basis of huge business concerns, even of near monopolies. I have
tried to deal with this subject elsewhere and here I merely state the
fact. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> This growth of bigness, this commercialization of culture,
is evinced in the phenomena of Hollywood, of radio, of the mass
circulation magazines, and in the growth of the book business in
recent years, especially during the war. With hundreds of millions of
dollars now invested in the production of cultural works, and of
pseudo or substitute cultural works, there is a mass market for
culture. With this mass market, there is an insatiable need for
cultural production. By and large, this means that the businessman&#8217;s
starting point for the creation of cultural works is not human needs
and human problems as these are seen from the standpoint of the
individual artist; to the contrary, the starting point for the
creation of cultural works becomes more and more the need to satisfy
a market. The market need is gradually casting a bigger and ever
bigger shadow over cultural creation. Whereas the plenitude of
commodities, the wealth of America, influenced themes and motifs of
fiction in the past, largely in the indirect fashion of posing
problems of leisure and enjoyment, now the commodity in itself is
becoming the deciding factor. In its most crude form, we can see this
in the tie-up between songs and sales in radio advertising.
Similarly, we now have popular songs in which the title and theme are
related to a commodity. Thus, the song, <em>Rum and Coca Cola</em>.</p>

<p>In the Film Production Code of the Hollywood studios, the
determination that characters in films keep the Ten Commandments
according to certain prescriptions is not the only concern: the
section on foreign countries, prescribing that the rulers,
institutions and customs of foreign countries be not cast into
disrepute is directly a provision which will help to make movies a
more salable commodity abroad. Also, it is a commonly known fact that
in film studios, great difficulties are encountered in the working
out of stories because of the dangers that something in a film may be
considered damaging to the good will or products of commodity
producers, or to the respect with which various occupations and
professions demand that their practitioners be viewed. Not only is it
a fact that cultural goods must be sold on a mass market with all
that this implies concerning content and standardization, but
additionally, in the more popular forms of culture, commodity needs,
sales needs, and the like are directly intervening in the very
organization of stories. Factors of this kind have entered in an
important way into the very creation of cultural works in America.
Here, it is necessary at least to mention this in passing. But there
are also other factors which demand our consideration.</p>

<p>It is impossible to press an ideology or set of values upon an
artist and thereby to guarantee that he will produce serious if not
great art. It is impossible in our time to make him create in terms
of a fixed set of moral values imposed on him and to guarantee that
good results will be attained. It is irrelevant and often inept to
tell an artist that he must either affirm or reject life, praise or
deride the dignity of man and so on. One of the tensions in American
society grows out of a conflict of values, out of the difference
between life as it is lived, and life as it is imaged in conventional
images and stereotypes. No form of society in the past has shoved
aside traditions as ruthlessly as has been the case with capitalism.
This is especially the case in America. In contemporary culture, the
traditions of the past cannot be expected to be as important as the
need of making some added dollars out of cultural production. It is
commonly declared (sometimes in voices of lament, sometimes in voices
of pride) that America has been traditionless. The relative
traditionlessness of America has been one of the reasons why American
capitalism has been, historically; a success, in the sense that I
have described it as such. It had less baggage of the past to shed;
it was less fettered than was the case in Europe. The relative
absence of tradition has been a positive aid to American capitalism.
At the same time, it is one of the important factors involved in the
relative shallowness of American culture, when we regard culture in
terms of humane culture, rather than more broadly so as to include
scientific, technological and business culture. This fact also hel ps
to explain important aspects of the motifs, the problems, the types
of character and subject matters that have so often been introduced
into American writing.</p>

<p>A tension between past and present, expressed by a contrast of
bourgeois and feudal values, has not been felt concretely in life in
America by the broader sections of the American population. Such a
theme in fiction, then, was not a major one because it was not a
major problem to many Americans. American writers have &#8211; even if
not with sufficient aesthetic resources taken their own problems.
They will continue to do this, and the critics who make moral,
ideological and political demands on them will fail to have a genuine
and lasting influence. In the last analysis, the only way that one
can really make these kinds of demands really effective is by calling
on the policeman to enforce them. However, it is in the form of such
demands that critics are speaking to writers and readers in the
present time, just as they have in the recent past.</p>

<p>Rather than discuss relevant problems here in reference to these
critics, rather than polemize against them here, rather than try to
present substitute demands on the writer, it seems to me that a
generalized account of problems that are now faced and a further
exploration of the comparisons and contrasts with nineteenth century
Russian fiction will, perhaps, be more fruitful.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Some Historical Factors</h4>

<p class="fst">Faith in progress is, in America, rapidly dissipating. Behind even
some of the propaganda for na&#239;ve conceptions of progress, there is seething inner doubt. In the realms
of commercial writing, where stories in praise of progress and the
American Way of Life are concocted in a pattern of simple and na&#239;ve
eulogies, this inner doubt is unmistakably intense. The glowing
language of Service and Progress, linked with the vulgar and
simple-minded economic notions of the 1920&#8217;s no longer can enlist
genuine and widespread belief. The proponents of rugged individualism
are and have been gradually shifting their lines of argument and
propaganda. Now and then, one or another of them breaks loose and
utters a shrill scream. But hardly anyone believes him. The business
men have had their day as the popularly conceived masters of destiny,
the popularly presented leaders of America, the models on the basis
of which youth will pattern itself. The presidents of the period when
the business man had his last day in the sunshine as a model and a
paragon are scarcely even mentioned. In memory, Warren Harding and
Calvin Coolidge are forgotten historical characters. The depression
has left its ineradicable impressions. The doubt, the disbelief in
the capacity of the business to guarantee and secure what had
frequently been called the promise of American life &#8211; this is a
psychological and political fact of contemporary America which cannot
be overlooked. It is evinced in the variations of emphasis in the
propaganda and advertising of some of the business concerns
themselves. One note, for instance, has been that of describing large
corporations as guardians, trustees of the people&#8217;s capital.</p>

<p>This fact has already been reflected in some of our so-called
popular culture. Just as some corporations have attempted to present
themselves in public in the light of trustees of the people&#8217;s
capital, the people&#8217;s resources, just as the late President
Roosevelt popularized the emphasis that the government is &#8220;your
government,&#8221; so has it been the case that a number of films, plays,
radio plays, novels and stories have been written in order to make a
corresponding emphasis, a populist emphasis which flatters &#8220;the
common people.&#8221; If we recall the origins of the phrase, &#8220;the
forgotten man,&#8221; we will remember that Sumner&#8217;s &#8220;forgotten man&#8221;
was really the man of the middle class. This forgotten man of the
middle class has again been equated with the people, as the
representative figure of the people, and as such, he has been
flattered. The chief protagonist of most of the late George Ade&#8217;s
fables in slang was this same man of the middle class. Ade&#8217;s humor
revolved around the attitudes, the smugness, the genuine human and
democratic (in the sense of social relationships) views of this man,
particularly in the face of the trusts and of social snobbery.
Penrod&#8217;s father was this same man, stereotyped. But now, this
reconstructed figure is placed in the context of a new set of
impressions and of a revised attitude concerning American life.</p>

<p>The late President Roosevelt told us in one of his speeches that
the faith of America is the faith of the common man. And this common
man, reflected in popular or mass-production art forms, embodies the
attitudes of the man of the middle class, regardless of his
particular occupation and class relationship in a particular work.
He, not the business man, is America. Just as a residue of attitudes
have been left after the collapse of the New Deal, so is there a
residue which can be described as the New Deal cultural climate. This
New Deal cultural climate is a consequence of the collapse of the
idea that the business man is legitimately, properly, and happily the
leading figure of America, the true master of destiny, the model of
conduct for youth, the man on whose. shoulders rests the
responsibility of securing the prosperity of the American Way of
Life. Fewer and fewer people believe this, and it is doubtful if many
of the business men themselves even believe it. Babbitt may still be
Babbitt, but he cannot sing the old tune.</p>

<p>The prosperity of the 1920&#8217;s ended in a collapse which
demonstrated conclusively that American economy could not &#8211; with
all of its productive capacity &#8211; sustain an internal market which
could guarantee what is called prosperity. The shadow of the next
depression hangs over the entire land. More and more, the probability
of another depression is taken as a fact, a fact that is often
accepted almost without debate. We can, in consequence of this, see
that the social conditions giving rise to the theme of the American
Dream, the American Way of Life in our culture are rapidly becoming
part of the past. Stage by stage, the implications, the premises, the
assertions which went to compose the ideology of the American Dream
have been chipped off. This is one of the facts behind the current
and widespread mood of insecurity. And, consequently, it becomes one
of the reasons which permit us to predict that gradually this theme
is bound to be abandoned in American writing.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Early Democratic Attitudes</h4>

<p class="fst">Time was when the treatment of the American dream in writing was
less nakedly political than at present. Democracy was embodied, not
in praise of the system of political democracy that has been
established in America, but rather, in terms of the social attitudes
and social relationships of characters. In this sense, the stories of
George Ade, the cartoons of the late Tad Dorgan, are illustrative.
The cartoons of the boys in the backroom showed directly that they
held democratic and equalitarian attitudes toward one another. The
George Ade character was uncomfortable if he acted like a snob. But
now this democratic feeling has to be asserted in banal political
statements and speeches made by characters, and introduced into the
story itself. In other words, the characters don&#8217;t prove democratic
social relationships by actions in a direct fashion: the author tries
to prove that these exist by overt statements and speeches. At the
same time, it needs to be said that in the past there was a social
warrant, a social and economic prerequisite, which made plausible the
success story if this be looked at merely in its own terms and on the
plane of the immediate and direct action presented in these success
stories of the past. That is to say, many people, relatively, had the
chance of succeeding. Social and class relationships were less
stratified than they are now.</p>

<p>The reaction to the success story in more serious and sensitive
fiction, thus, was that of revealing patterns of destiny which
emphasized that success didn&#8217;t create inner harmony, contentment.
In other words, one emphasis was that of the consequences of success.
Serious writers registered the fact of negative consequences. The
weakness and superficiality of the success story was not to be found
so much in falseness, in the sense of emphasizing a possibility in
America that was not open to a fairly proportionate section of the
population: rather, its falseness lay in the shallowness of its
psychology, in its substitution of stereotype for character. Today,
the successful movie and fiction heroes often register a sense of
guilt. They are nostalgic for the days when they were not successful.
Further, a new success story is being written, the success story of
the character of glamor, the entertainer, the popular artist, the
jazz musician and so on. Willy nilly, new models of conduct, new
types for imitation, new heroes are being created in mass production
culture. These new heroes are entertainers, usually ones who come
from the people, not the classes. They are common or forgotten men.
This is evidence of the rust that has accumulated on the American
Dream of other years.</p>

<p>With such tendencies apparent at the present time, we can see that
whereas in the past, the American Way of Life was opening vistas to
the future, it is not seen, principally, as one which constitutes
a way of life that poses problems. Almost the entire nation,
practically, is aware that grave and crucial problems have developed
in America, and that these are, basically, economic. All of the
necessary conclusions, however, have not been drawn from this
awareness. Withal, there is now no mistaking the fact that a state of
awareness of serious problems exists. This awareness stamps the fact
that people of all classes are more conscious that something is
wrong, that problems exist. As a corollary of this, it is perceived
that these problems involve the future of everyone, the sense of the
self which people hold of themselves, the destiny which they envisage
for themselves and their children. In other words, the awareness of
problems of this order is one that is now intimately related with the
moods, the feelings, the intimate personal life, the psychology of
people. It is such awareness which is one of the preconditions for
changes in the content and themes of writing, and for changes and
variation in the tastes of readers. When problems remain purely
public and generalized, then the existence of these problems may have
little direct relationship to tastes in reading. But when they are
grasped directly, intimately by people, they will most likely begin
to be revealed, expressed, stated in literature. A problem that is
public in character must be translated into the terms whereby men and
women realize that its existence as a problem involves their very
sense of themselves. This, precisely, is what happened, and this,
precisely, is one of the ways in which we can see why the American
Dream is becoming a worn-out literary motif.</p>

<p>During the war, not only Americans, &#8220;but the entire human race,
was given an education,&#8221; the like of which has never been gained in
the past. Conclusions have not been drawn from this education, but
that does not negate the fact itself. The war beat and pressed itself
into the very organisms of almost everyone. The realization that
world problems exist is now one that has been translated into
problems of the self, problems of personal life. With the atom bomb,
it is no choice intelligent few who know that it is possible for
humanity, itself, to be annihilated. Despite arguments, promises,
propaganda to the contrary, Gallup Polls, shortly after the war,
indicated that over fifty per cent of the American population either
believed or else did not exclude as a definite possibility. the onset
of a Third World War, of one that will be worse than the Second. This
attests to the same fact that we have already noted. Public problems
are now being translated into the problem of the self.</p>

<p>It was the translation of public, of general problems, into those
of the self which helps to explain the development of the novel in
Russia in the nineteenth century. Czarist Russia was topsy turvy. The
twentieth century is topsy turvy. The sense of America as being topsy
turvy is growing. In this sense there now is to be seen a parallel
between nineteenth-century Czarist Russia and twentieth-century
America. But this parallel must be strictly limited. The
topsy-turviness of Czarist Russia was based on the contradictions
between feudal and capitalist relationships and this existed in a
period when capitalism was expanding, and when there was confidence
in the future of capitalism. Contrast the greater ease with which
Europe could recover from the ravages of the Napoleonic War than it
can from the two World Wars of the twentieth century, and one sees
this historic change clearly. Today, we live in a topsy-turvy world
which cannot expand as was the case in the nineteenth century.
Capitalism was then progressive. Capitalism is now exhausting itself.
It has received two mortal wounds in the form of two World Wars. It
is like a beast that is slowly dying from these wounds. How long its
death agony will be is unpredictable. Whether it lashes out and
gathers together its last energies and snarls and bites like a
wounded dying beast gone berserk before it expires, is another
unpredictable matter. These general factors define the limits of our
analogy with Russian literature.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Contradictory Tendencies at Work</h4>

<p class="fst">The conditions for literary change, for a literary renaissance,
are various. One of them is this awareness that historic, political,
social, economic problems involves the very status and destiny of the
individual self. This condition exists in America. It may serve as
one of the prerequisites for a period of literary ferment and even of
literary renaissance. A force that is checking this ferment and
renaissance, however, is found in the fact that big business is in
control of a large and most significant area of culture. A second
factor that may check an American renaissance lies in the fact that,
despite cheerful words expressed in public, despair is widespread.
Many literary critics, commentators, clergymen, political leaders and
others have the mistaken notion that a literature of so-called
negativism is a danger to an existing social system. This is
incorrect. If we look at Russian literature of the nineteenth and the
early twentieth century, we can prove this. The writers who did the
most damage to the Czarist system were :hose who affirmed life, if I
may use the language of Van Wyck Brooks and others. Tolstoy affirmed
life, and no Russian writer of his time was a greater menace to the
security and even the existence of Czarism than was Leo Tolstoy.</p>

<p>There are few writers more likely to make rebels, even to this
day, than Tolstoy.</p>

<p>Dostoevsky defended Czarism. He co-related the defense of Czarism
with belief in God, and, correspondingly, saw revolution in atheism.
Yet his major influence negates his affirmations. For he worked out
the problems of belief in God, and in doing this, he created an ideal
character, Aloysha Karamazov. When we read <strong>The Brothers Karamazov</strong>,
many of us work through this problem anew, and we do not conclude
that we will emulate Aloysha, that we will try to be like him, and
that if we do, we can save our own selves. Dostoevsky, defender of
the Czarist system, was really a danger to that system. But contrast
these two writers with Artzbashieff, their literary inferior and a
man who came after them. His work is morally nihilistic: <strong>Sanine</strong>
had a widespread but relatively transitory influence.</p>

<p>Whereas Tolstoy and Dostoevsky worked out central problems of the
self in literature, Artzbashieff popularized facile despair, facile
and at least semi-hooliganized Nietzscheanism. If one seriously
imitated Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, one would more seriously explore,
more seriously try to harmonize ideals and action: doing this, one
would actually be in a position concretely and intimately to test
their affirmations, to know by the very tensions and play of impulse
in oneself whether or not these worked. Imitating Artzbashieff&#8217;s
Sanine, one runs away from oneself: one substitutes a facile
immoralism for a moral seriousness. Moral nihilism does not endanger
a crumbling social system in the way that moral seriousness does.
Cynics and moral nihilists perform the role of safety valves. The
moral nihilist, in emphasizing hopelessness and cynicism, thereby
implies the lesson that there is no future worth fighting for. And
those who attack a social system at its foundation are men who firmly
believe that there is a future worth fighting for, and with this,
that life is worth passing on. In this sense, they are morally
serious. Dostoevsky and Tolstoy confirm and strengthen an attitude of
moral seriousness in readers; Artzbashieff doesn&#8217;t. Further, this
difference is most important for young readers. They, above all
others, can learn these lessons from literature. If the guardians of
what is called order and property in this world care for advice from
this critic, I willingly give it to them. I advise them to tell the
youth, especially the serious youth, to read writers like
Artzbashieff, not ones like Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. Various
newspapers, publicists and others are fighting post-war
disillusionment by denying it, by condemning it. But the simple fact
is that it is here. We now live in the era of post-war
disillusionment. An era of widespread mass disillusionment proves
that you cannot fool all. of the people all of the time. The most
common demonstration to validate the assertion that the people cannot
always be fooled can easily be observed &#8211; in periods of widespread
disillusionment. Before masses of people prove that they cannot be
always fooled by taking the road of social revolution, they will
often display apathy, disillusionment. They show that they are not
fooled in the realm of immediate and practical life, but in broadened
political and cultural areas. Personal life affords everyone the
immediate and concrete basis for empirically testing the values that
are generalized in culture. When the workers are told that the
capitalists can guarantee them jobs and a high standard of living,
and the capitalists fail to fulfill their guarantee, they begin to
disbelieve. They are not fooled by this promise. A new promise, a new
guarantee, may fool them, but the old one will not. When women are
told that it is murder to practice contraception, and when they
experience dangerous and debilitating consequences after acting on
this moral instruction, they, also, draw conclusions. When Catholic
daughters, for instance, see what it has meant for their mothers to
be child-bearing animals, they often draw the conclusion of
practicing birth control.</p>

<p>Endless illustrations of this simple truism could be elaborated.
Here, we need, mainly, to apply it to the assumptions of the American
Dream, to the eulogistic conceptions of the American Way of Life.
When motion picture and mass production stories continuously present
the same fables to masses of people, they feed their revery,
de-energize their moral nerves. But at the same time, they show these
people what they do not have. Over and over again, the trial of
values of American capitalist society is imaginatively, made in this
popular art. It can confirm these values only temporarily. It can
induce only passing belief. For depression, the opportunity for freer
sexual relationships, the many-sided possibilities of life, the
many-sided frustrations of people all tend to negate the implications
of these films and stories. Social, political conclusions are not
necessarily drawn as a consequence. But personal conclusions are. And
through this process of acceptance and rejection in private life, the
movie makers, the hack writers, the magazine editors and others are
providing the American people with concrete material that permits
them to evaluate the success or failure of the so-called American Way
of Life. Just as children gradually come to understand that neither
Santa Claus nor the Big Bad Wolf exists, so do adults come to
understand that other kinds of fairy tales are &#8211; fairy tales.</p>

<p>It is this conclusion which again leads me to offer advice to all
of American reaction, advice which I doubt that they will take. My
advice to them is to encourage an art and a literature of moral
nihilism. Moral nihilism is their major barrier to the drawing of
conclusions in the present era. What is now a major danger to them is
an art of moral seriousness. The masters of our destiny, politically,
economically, and theologically, have all issued promissory notes:
they lack the moral, the political capital to pay on the line on
these notes. Their failure is now stamped and almost dated by the
great scientific discovery in human history, die capture of atomic
energy. Those who say that only America could have produced the
atomic bomb in this period are correct. Capitalistic America &#8211; as
the fact proves &#8211; alone could do this. But in having done this,
capitalistic America has demonstrated that it cannot solve probletms
for itself, let alone for all humanity. The man from Independence,
Missouri, sits in the White House, in no enviable position. When he
was to become President of these United States as a consequence of
the death of the late Franklin D. Roosevelt, he is reported to have
declared that he felt as though he had been hit by the moon and the
stars. He was hit by something as terrible: he was hit by the
problems of this period.</p>

<p>Many years ago, a man from the border states, a man from Kentucky,
a man of the people, sat where he now sits. That man possessed the
will, the humanity, the greatness to &#8211; regardless of all else &#8211;
organize a war so that a problem would be solved, however terribly.
History has changed, or as we are told, Time Marches On. His
successor, the man from Missouri, can solve nothing. His impasse is
focused in his atom bomb policy. If he reveals the alleged secrets,
or if he doesn&#8217;t, the same problem remains. Neither secrecy nor
openness will guarantee us, or our children, from war and possibly,
annihilation. The atom bomb focuses sharply, dramatically, and in a
manner which can press terror into every human being, the problems of
the present. Now, the world crisis is not a generalized crisis merely
to be talked about in newspapers and books. Now, it is not merely a
problem for the leaders, the masters of destiny. Now, as never
before, it has been, it is being translated into the intimate
consciousness of almost. every adult human being on the face of this
planet. This has profound, and not fully predictable, consequences
for literature. These consequences can be stated, to repeat, by the
remark that now there is a wide special awareness that the problems
of the world at large involve every aspect of the very life of
individual human beings. It is a realization of this that produces
the frantic formula &#8211; modern man is obsolete. The correct statement
is that contemporary ideology is obsolete. Art, in affirming this
ideology, is bound, in the long run to drive home more forcibly the
fact of this obsolescence. Culture pressed into the service of this
obsolescence cannot succeed. It must call on the aid of the policeman
for a relative success.</p>

<p>American literature, in this period of continuing crisis, will
develop how? The real answer to this question will be written by the
new generations. And we can suggest, repeating in conclusion, that
this answer will be of one kind or another depending on whether or
not we have moral nihilism or moral seriousness. In this way, the
moral question, so frequently discussed, is really involved in the
literary situation. The critics who speak in generalized moral
affirmation have done a disservice to their country. They have
created the wrong kind of confusion. The cultural defense of the
<em>status quo</em> demands now, not a continuation of the old fables
of health and happiness and love: it demands not a belief in God in a
vacuum. It demands despair that will be channeled into personal, into
personally self-destructive actions and attitudes. It demands not the
rose-colored falseness of hope, but rather, the compensatory and
consoling self-flattery of personal cynicism, of personal
disillusionment. For this dissipates those feelings of alarm, of
urgency, of growing and insistent demand for change which turns
personal disillusionments into social and political deeds. This,
then, is the general setting for the problems which the new and young
writer, the next generation of intellectuals face as they begin to
function. This, further, I believe, suggests the nature of the
problems involved in the analysis of the content of contemporary
American culture. This, briefly, outlines certain of the significant
aspects of contemporary cultural problems. To give answers to these
problems, to chart a new course is a present task, a task which rests
mainly on younger generations.</p>
