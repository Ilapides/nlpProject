<p class="fst">In recent years there has been a growing emphasis on the moral
questions in all kinds of discussions; journalistic, political,
literary. Such widespread interest in and discussion of many types of
issues from a standpoint of morality should help to suggest the,
moral impasse into which the entire capitalist system, and with it
the Soviet Union, has sunk. Briefly, the modern world has fallen into
a moral abyss. In, the light of this condition, it is obvious that
discussions of morality deal with matters which are undeniably
serious. However, the seriousness of a subject or of an issue does
not mean that all those who discuss it are equally serious. To the
contrary, there is almost a pathos of pettiness in the lack of
seriousness with which a number of writers &#8211; ex-Marxists,
journalists who have been styled &#8220;one-man revolutions,&#8221; literary
critics included &#8211; have tried to discuss serious moral questions
while they, at the same time, have been so unserious.</p>

<p>In dealing with the moral question here, two counterposed.
approaches can be cited, the approach which emphasizes social
morality, and that which stresses personal morality. A social
morality conceives the basic cause, the basic conditions which permit
or delimit practices which are condemned on moral grounds as
derivable from the structural character of society itself. In
consequence, the aim of social morality in changing and lifting moral
practice to a higher level is that of changing society, or
eradicating those conditions which, sanction and which contribute in
manifold ways to practices that are, open to condemnation because
they result in social harm, in the deformation of human personalities
and in the oppression of groups, classes and nations, let alone
individuals. To rephrase this aim, a social morality conceives social
change as the means of helping to create better moral conditions. The
real core of any social morality, the most clear theoretical
establishment of the premises of such a social morality, is to be
found in revolutionary Marxism. For it declares decisively and
without equivocation, that the major factor in sanctioning harmful
practices that can be be morally condemned is to be seen in the
exploitation of man by man. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p>The recent recrudescence of moral interest, real and verbal, has
been partly manifested in a moral critique of Marxian morality. The
criticisms of and attacks upon Marxism, from the moral standpoint,
have, however, been of varying seriousness, of variable importance
and of differing merit, often from case to case. In some instances,
to cite an example, these attacks have been upon the practices of
individuals or organizations which are organized within the
historical tradition of Marxism. In the case of such criticisms, some
have been on the ground that Marxists, or so-called Marxists (if one
will) have violated in practice their own moral standards: other
criticisms have been to the effect that immoral practices, real or
alleged on the part of Marxists, have been a consequence of the
essential ideas, the basis, the seemingly ineradicable character of
Marxian theory and practice itself. However, it is rare that critics,
well-intentioned or otherwise, intelligent and informed, or obtuse
and trivial, have attacked the premise upon which a Marxian, a
socialist, moral conception is and must be built &#8211; its condemnation
of the exploitation of man by man. Here, where I speak then of
Marxian morality, I do it on the basis of this premise. The major
reason for immoral practice in modern society is, directly or
indirectly, a consequence off the exploitation of man by man; this,
in turn, means the exploitation of social classes by other social
classes, in order that the exploiting classes can reap something of
the share in the fruits of what the exploited class produces, so
often produces under conditions which barely permit much more than a
subsistence living. For the purposes of this article, subsidiary
questions, questions of the practices of Marxians, criticisms of the
methods of certain organizations which are or which style themselves
Marxian, are not at issue and do not bear directly on the points of
this discussion. Hence, I do not take them up in detail.</p>

<p>Counter to a conception of morality which is social is a
conception which is individual and which assumes that, when looked at
morally, the major problem facing man is that of the regeneration of
the individual rather than that of changing society. There are a
number of varieties of this attitude, various Christian attitudes,
such as that of the Catholic Church, which holds that the purpose of
life is death and the aim of a good man on this earth should be that
of saving his soul in the next world, that of Tolstoyism, which
preaches passive resistance, pacifism, a-politicalism in general, and
sexual abstinence (although it is rare to find a Tolstoyan who
accepts this feature of Leo Tolstoy&#8217;s morality), that of various
anarchists, Platonists and pseudo-Platonists, ex-Marxists,
psychiatrists who conceive the curing of psychoneurosis as the major
problem facing man, and so on. I don&#8217;t wish arbitrarily to equate
these various doctrines, based on one or another form of personal, or
self-regeneration. However, it should be clear that they can be
grouped together in the sense that they present the problem of the
individual as prior to the social problem.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Social and Personal Morality</h4>

<p class="fst">There is no necessary polarity between a moral code based on what
I here call social morality, and one based on personal morality. When
separations are made, these are a consequence of bifurcation, of
separating of the individual and of society. Man &#8211; and this is also
stressed in Marxian writing &#8211; lives out his personal drama on the
plane of society: man&#8217;s very self and his personality are socially
directed, socially delimited, socially organized. The self is a
social product, not an individual entity which is superior to,
anterior to, separable from society. A bifurcation of society and the
individual, and the establishment of moral premises on the basis of
either aspect of. this bifurcation, is misleading. To treat society &#8211;
in other words &#8211; as outside of man, superior to man, the sole
responsible agent for what is called immoral action, is to confuse
the issue. To consider and to condemn immoral action on the ground
that the individual, and the individual alone <em>qua</em> individual,
is solely responsible for the action so condemned, and that, in no
way, is the society in which he lives also responsible, is equally to
be seen as misleading. In consequence, a social morality should not
and cannot base itself on such a bifurcation. When this social
morality is premised on the fact of the exploitation of man by man it
should, however, be obvious that such a morality is not guilty of the
aforesaid bifurcation. The law, the standards, the moral sanction,
the mores of capitalist society sanction exploitation, grant to
individuals with money the legal right to exploit others. But when a
man is exploited he is not exploited by society in general: he is
exploited by individual men. Furthermore, a careful reading of, say,
Marx&#8217;s <strong>Capital</strong> should make it clear that Marx definitely
indicates, and implies, that a society based on exploitation, such as
is capitalist society, creates the conditions whereby both exploited
and exploiter are deformed in their very selves, and that, thus, they
pay a moral price. Something of their human nature is deformed. Other
writers, besides Marx, have made the same kind of a point, and this
point has been dramatized in fiction. Thus it can be shown I believe
that this is one of the motifs of Tolstoy&#8217;s, <strong>War and Peace</strong>
<a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>; also, it is, I hold, possible to demonstrate that this same
motif, in the context of the conditions dealt with in the novel, is
centrally involved in <strong>The Adventures of Huckleberry Firm</strong> by
Mark Twain. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p>A social morality should not conceive society as undynamic; it
should not view society as a responsible agent in itself when
divorced from the men who live in that society, affirm&#8217; or attack
its sanctions, live by, in spite of, or in opposition to its values,
and make up the human beings who form that society. If this is done,
social morality is rendered arbitrary. And such an arbitrary social
morality can often serve the means of turning morality into merely
sentimental and innocuous humanitarianism which preaches, but does
not practice. It can, and has been, turned into a philosophy of
social service in which social service, social work, is made . into a
substitute for political action, for independent political action on
the part of the workers, on the part of all the oppressed and
exploited. But, on the other hand, a morality that is solely premised
on a conception of personal and self-regeneration is usually limited
at best and most often it is, besides being inadequate, a means of
evading many issues, a means of expressing moral snobbery and moral
priggishness, a means of moral escape and inactivity.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Morality and Literature</h4>

<p class="fst">The problem of literature and morals is complicated and is &#8211; at
least it can be &#8211; a serious one. For moral conceptions, moral
judgments concerning literature are ultimately inescapable, even if
these judgments are made on the basis of merely the satisfaction of
needs which give pleasure, and the escape of pains which cause
suffering. Simply put, morality deals with what is considered to be
either good or bad, and good or bad are determined, absolutely or
relativistically, in terms of some set of values, attitudes,
standards. We all make moral judgments, and we make moral judgments,
at times, when we discuss literature. Recently the re-establishment
of problems of literature and morality has been one of the
manifestations of the alleged moral renaissance of our times. This
problem has been posed and dealt with differently by various literary
critics and writers. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> The current revival of Henry James, the
establishment of James (in fact) as what amounts to a cult figure has
also restated problems of literature and morality. Some of the James
enthusiasts have, in fact, presented James as a moralist. But there
are moralists and moralists. In James, morals and manners become
inermixed, and we can see this simply and clearly in one of his best
stories, <strong>Daisy Miller</strong>. Daisy, a delightful, spontaneous and
wholly attractive American girl in Europe &#8211; a characterization
which, if nothing else could be cited, would be more than enough to
establish James as an artist of perception and extraordinary
adroitness &#8211; faces dual dangers. The dangers she faces flow out of
the fact that, in matters of social relationships, her spirit is
democratic, and that, in general, she is direct, frank, honest. These
dangers are (a) the possibility that she may lose her virginity, and
this is, in the world in which she lives, synonymous with ruin and
degradation, and (b) the danger that she will compromise herself and
cause her social ruin by associating with men in public in a way that
is not prescribed by the code of etiquette that prevails among the
socially acceptable people with whom she comes in contact. In James&#8217;
work, there is often such a mixture of morals and manners. James was
not a moralist in the sense that Tolstoy was. James did not write
with an urgency, even a pitiless consistency, urging change, urging
it as a demanding necessity, defending a code of morals which he saw
as higher than that prevalent in his times and, at the same time,
condemning the code prevalent in his times and all of the evils that
flowed out of it. Morality in James&#8217; writing is merely reflected.
As the consequence of a tight moral code and also as the consequence
of an inhumanly stuffy set of principles of etiquette, there are
deforming consequences to be seen in the lives of various Jamesian
characters. This is what I mean by saying that in James&#8217; world
morality is merely reflected.</p>

<p>When James, then, is used as an illustration of the connection
between literature and morality, this point must be stressed. If it
is not, confusion is created. And the confusion created is as unfair
to the reputation of James as it is to the reader, especially to the
reader who is not very alert, and who has not, in his own mind,
clearly posed and considered these problems. And it is this aspect
of the present revival of interest in the works of Henry James which
is most open to criticism. For the creation of such confusion creates
additional ones. The moral problem is in this way turned into a
personal problem and, as such, it becomes a means of evading the
problems of social morality. At the same time, the moral problem is
confused with problems, if they be called such, of good manners. This
kind of confusion is seemingly <em>au courant</em>; it is one of the
newest things; it is to be found in the work of critics and writers
who are, presumably, the most culturally advanced people in America.
<a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> The seeming newness of this stylized and estheticized morality
makes it appear as part of the tone of the times. But actually it )s
an attitude which is one of the stalest of all reactionary tricks.
Until reaction is forced out into the open, where it must be nakedly
violent, it needs to rely on all kinds of subterfuges. and these
subterfuges appear in literature, in literary criticism, in
philosophy, in ideology in general. The full or the partial equation
of morals with manners, the stylization of morals into an
esthetic-moral attitude, the snobbery that grows out of this so that
special appreciators of literature, of cultural value, become
advanced people &#8211; how common, even how banal, this is! In passing,
I would remark that a parallel attitude in politics was one of the
major ideological weapons of the rebellious slave owners who tried to
destroy the American Union in 1861, and to establish in perpetuity a
slave owners&#8217; republic in America. And the ideologists of the slave
owners said that their cause would win because Jefferson Davis was
more educated than Abraham Lincoln, that he had better manners than
the rail-splitter and that &#8211; to cap the climax &#8211; he was also the
better looking of the two presidents. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> I cite this example. not to
equate the ideologists of the slave owners with some of our current,
advanced, educated, genteel and undeniably competent literary people
of the hour, but, rather, to point out by illustration that there are
various manifestations of this reactionary subterfuge.</p>

<p>This estheticized morality on which I have commented is a
variation of the moral attitude which demands personal regeneration
in place of social change. But at best it is a morality in only the
most tenuous sense. It is not robust, it is not all-inclusive. It is,
largely, literary. And it functions. more or less, by dealing with
moral reflection, as this is to be grasped in the reading and the
analysis of works in literary art. However, there is something else
to be said concerning works of literature which deal with moral
problems in terms of personal experience. Two writers who, in my
opinion, are of lasting significance in world literature have dealt
with moral problems in works of art. I cite them &#8211; Dostoevsky, Ibsen.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Dostoevsky&#8217;s Approach</h4>

<p class="fst">In Dostoevsky, a moral problem is dealt with from the standpoint
of personal experience, in the case of the chief protagonist, or of
one of the chief protagonists. The moral problem usually results from”
an act or acts on the part of a hero who, by this act, causes serious
and even irreparable injury to another human being or else the wish
to commit such an act. Thus, Raskolnikov commits a murder. Thus, Ivan
Karamazov wishes for the death of his father and acts on this wish by
speaking with high suggestiveness to Smerdakakov, who is the actual
murderer: Ivan, then, goes off so as to be away from the scene at the
time that the murder &#8211; if it is to be committed &#8211; will be
perpetrated. An action of this kind, for Dostoevsky, then poses
directly a moral problem in the mind of the hero. This problem
becomes obsessive. It is expressed in a need for change, a need for
confession, a need for a relaxation of a disturbing, a painfully
recurring, a demanding sense of guilt. Dostoevsky, thus, deals in
moral problems in terms of consequences on others as well as on the
agent who commits such an act. And these problems are the result of
actions presented in his narratives, actions which are central in his
stories. He meets moral problems head on. Furthermore, Dostoevsky,
directly and by unmistakable implications, identifies himself with
sinners, with criminals, with the suffering, with the unfortunate. He
was explicitly reactionary, but he never masked this fact. And
explicitly reactionary though he was, he nonetheless identified
himself not with those who benefited most from their advantageous
position in reactionary Czarist society, but those who suffered most,
those who punished themselves and others. And this work, at the same
time, expressed an urgent need for change, for psychological change
which he perceived as a process of purgation and regeneration. Thus,
it is to be noted that at the end of <strong>Crime and Punishment</strong>,
Raskolnikov, a convicted and confessed murderer, is described as
bound for Siberia, and the author states that this sets the stage for
a possible drama of Raskolninov&#8217;s regeneration. Finally, it can be
seen in Dostoevsky&#8217;s writings that the moral problem posed involved
the hero, the chief protagonist. I remark on this fact because one
can now note how in this new tendency of stylized literary morality,
the moral problem is posed in terms of the spectator who doesn&#8217;t
act, who doesn&#8217;t have to make decisions.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Ibsen&#8217;s Approach</h4>

<p class="fst">For Ibsen, a recurrent problem was that of conscience. A
representative Ibsen character, such as Mrs. Alving or the wife of
John Gabril Borkman, is haunted by ghosts. The ghost symbolizes a
feeling of guilt that resides in the conscience, and that
continuously poisons the existence of one or more persons in the
present. The actions of some person in the past have seriously
affected the destinies of people, and by these actions, the sins of
the fathers, as it were, are visited on the children: this happens
not as a result of any general moral law of the universe or because
of the Will of God, but, rather, as a result of connected
circumstances and relationships. The guilt for this past action, the
visitation of the ghost of conscience comes about because of
immediate and direct consequences which are perceivable in the life
of one or more persons who is a victim of these past actions, who
suffers in consequence and who is in one way or another, unfree. The
yearning and manly urge for freedom expressed in Ibsen is a desire to
be free of these ghosts. Further, these ghosts are intimately
associated with bourgeois morality. In Ibsen&#8217;s world it is a
bourGeois who has been guilty of the actions in the past which cause
serious problems in the present. It is more favorably situated
persons, in Ibsen, who suffer moral guilt. In this connection, one
might passingly remark that Ibsen does not throw the major burden of
guilt on Jacob Ingrstrum, and on his daughter, who, in <em>Ghosts</em>,
is a maid in the Alving household. These two characters, both of them
lower class in status, are shown as being more or less like they are
as a consequence of actions of their superiors, and these actions of
their superiors were &#8211; this is unmistakable in <em>Ghosts</em> &#8211; possible
because of the superior class and social position of the Alvings.</p>

<p>In general, it can be observed that in many works of the past
which deal with morality from the standpoint of personal experience
and of personal problems, there are parallel features to those which
we have briefly noted in the case of Dostoevsky and Ibsen. The artist
does not reveal these moral problems from the standpoint of the upper
classes. He does not present the upper classes as morally superior.
Rather, he deals with the moral problems, and the moral consequences
which must be posed by those who have a relatively favored position
in society.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A Current Example</h4>

<p class="fst">In <strong>Partisan Review</strong>, Fall 1945, there is a story by Lionel
Trilling, <em>The Other Margaret</em>, which will throw light on these
problems. It can be accepted as a representative literary expression
of the stylized literary-moral tendency which exists in advanced
cultural circles of contemporary New York. The chief protagonist of
Mr. Trilling&#8217;s story is named Stephen Elwin: he is a cultivated
scientific publisher; he&#8217;s married, and he has a thirteen-year-old
daughter, Margaret, who obviously goes to a progressive school. Stephen
lives in the East Nineties, and the best feature of the story is the
manner in which Trilling recreates the genteel, cultivated wistful
atmosphere of an educated family living in such a section of
Manhattan. Stephen, a man of taste, is first seen buying a reproduction
of Roualt. He can be described as a seeker after wisdom, and early in
the story, he recalls that in high school, a teacher had read to his
class, the following sentence from Hazlitt: &#8220;No young man believes
he shall ever die.&#8221; Then, Stephen didn&#8217;t understand the wisdom of
this sentence fully: but now, at the age of forty-one, he does
understand this sentence. Wisdom is, thus, the knowledge of death. He
is wistful, gentle, and he has wisdom as well as taste. In addition,
Stephen perceives what is presumably the moral problem of the present
time, and this moral problem, tendentiously posed and described, is
at the heart of Trilling&#8217;s story.</p>

<p>The moral problem presented in this story concerns the question of
responsibility. Is the individual responsible for his actions, or is
society responsible? And further, as Stephen sees this problem from the
vantage point of a moral spectator, this problem arises in class
terms. In the course of the story, three important incidents, which
afford data concerning this moral problem, are related. As Stephen rides
home on a Fifth Avenue bus, an Irish conductor is nasty to a small
boy of the well-to-do classes, a small boy who might be as Stephen was
in the days when he didn&#8217;t truly understand the wisdom of that
sentence &#8211; &#8220;No young man believes that he shall ever die.&#8221;
Then, when Stephen arrives home with his reproduction, and his daughter,
Margaret, ritualistically prepares his pre-supper cocktail for him,
Stephen&#8217;s wife, Lucy, happens to tell how she was riding on a bus,
and she heard another conductor speaking to a Jewish person with
anti-Semitic innuendoes. Further, the Elwins are having
difficulties with their colored maid, who is &#8220;The Other Margaret.&#8221;
(This explains the title of the story.) &#8220;The Other Margaret&#8221; is
very unpleasant. On this day, she has not shown up for work. Mrs.
Elwin has to cook dinner.</p>

<p>While she does this, Stephen has his drink. He shows his Roualt
reproduction to the daughter. She doesn&#8217;t like it. Father and
daughter discuss morality. The daughter disagrees with Stephen
concerning the conduct of &#8220;The Other Margaret.&#8221; Margaret declares
that she isn&#8217;t to be blamed for her rudeness. At school, Margaret has a
liberal teacher who tells the children that society is responsible.
Stephen, wistfully tolerant, doesn&#8217;t press his objections to his
daughter&#8217;s view too strongly. But it is clear that he doesn&#8217;t
accept it. He points out to her how they had a previous maid who had
to borrow money in order to go South because of family sickness. This
maid paid back the money she borrowed, and thus, she &#8211; while of the
lower classes &#8211; is different from &#8220;The Other Margaret.&#8221; Also,
at school, Margaret has modelled a toy lamb which is to be given her
mother as a birthday present. She shows this to her father. He is
pleased. The mother sees it and she is touched.</p>

<p>The other Margaret unexpectedly appears to serve dinner. She is
again very rude in her work. But this rudeness doesn&#8217;t change
Margaret&#8217;s view that society is responsible. However, after dinner,
&#8220;The Other Margaret&#8221; &#8211; as is her wont &#8211; breaks things. One of
the things she breaks is the personally precious lamb which Margaret has
made for her mother. When this happens, the daughter cries in anger.
She denounces &#8220;The Other Margaret.&#8221; She declares that the maid
did this on purpose, and out of hatred for herself, Margaret. In
consequence, the claim that society, and not the individual, is
responsible is refuted: Margaret&#8217;s liberal teacher is shown to be wrong
on the basis of evidence to be found in personal experience. Margaret is
hurt, and she cries. Stephen gives her what comfort he can, but this is
not sufficient to heal the wound she has received. And this wound is,
additionally, revealed as one of the scars of growing up. Like her
father, she, also, must bear the pains of growth and discovery, those
pains which mark the journey through life whereby the child becomes
the youth, the youth who believes that he will never die, and the
youth goes on into the maturity of middle age and there, he begins to
attain wisdom. The attainment of wisdom is painful, and it teaches us
that we die, that we are responsible agents, and that we must accept
our responsibility. This in substance is the theme of Trilling&#8217;s story.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Story Is Tendentious</h4>

<p class="fst">On the one hand, this story has been conceived and written with
adroitness: on the other hand, it is highly tendentious, and its
tendentiousness is revealed in the careful selection of incidents.
Thus, all of the middle class people in this story are kind,
civilized, tolerant. They want to be fair. To the contrary, the
workers, the lower classes, appear in the image of a bus conductor
and a colored maid. They are insulting, rude, and cruel. The rudeness
of the lower classes is seen in the sphere of home life, of personal
experience, and of passing incidents of the streets. This rudeness is
not called for if one considers the kindness of the middle class
Elwin and the inoffensiveness of the boy whom the bus conductor
insults. These incidents are used as data of experience on the basis
of which a conclusion is to be reached concerning the moral problem
of the contemporary period. The moral view of Stephen Elwin is that
the individual is responsible: the opposite view is presented as the
claim that society is responsible. This alternative view is presented
in the words of an inexperienced thirteen-year-old girl who is still
too young to appreciate the painting of Roualt. She has learned this,
as if by rate, from an off stage teacher who never appears directly
in the story. In addition, this social view of morality is presented
in a few generalized sentences. Opposed to the child who defends the
ideas of social morality, we have the moral spectator, the man who
has grown to wisdom, Stephen Elwin. At the same time, Stephen is not
really called upon to act morally. He is one who perceives the data
of experience necessary for the drawing of moral conclusions in much
the same manner as he tastefully appreciates the work of Roualt.</p>

<p>There is in all this a truly high-faluting triviality. Trilling
wastes his genuine skill and cultivation on such triviality, and he
masks it by so organizing the story as to be able to draw an almost
all-encompassing moral conclusion. At the same time, this generalized
moral is the projected concealment of a guilty sensibility. Stephen
Elwin&#8217;s wistfully sad feeling about the rudeness and brutality of
the world &#8211; as this is shown by bus conductors and maids &#8211; what
is this, if it isn&#8217;t the attitude we find in contemporary
criticism, in the Henry James cultists, in those critics and writers
who were the literary Marxists of yesterday? Furthermore, the
triviality of this story is to be found in the relative pettiness of
the incidents and the relative grandeur of the conclusion. For the
conclusion of this story affirms nothing less than that man is a free
agent. For to be a free agent is the sense of the claim that the
individual is responsible. Thus, while we can recognize the skill
with which this story is written, and while we can, at the same time,
see that it has the merit of picturing a certain cultivated <em>milieu</em>
of the present, it is also necessary to point out that it is a story
which is cleverly organized in such a way as to persuasively present
a reactionary moral view. It seems that the very needs of the story,
then, will explain its tendentiousness. This tendentiousness is to be
found not in overt statements, but in the very selectivity of the
story. The rude lower classes are described by conversation, or else,
they are seen in action, offending children. The cultivated
intellectual of the middle class is presented as a thoughtful man, a
tolerant man, and his consciousness is penetrated by the author.
Further this man is not an exploiting capitalist who brutally grinds
down the workers: he is a man who performs a valuable social
function: he publishes scientific books. His way of life and his way
of feeling is that of the intellectual: in fact, he could even be a
literary critic, for the style and tone of his thoughts suggest the
man of literary rather than of scientific cultivation. He is curious
about aesthetics, about morals, and he is truly a seeker after
wisdom. But his curiosity does not reach to the point where Stephen
would pose, for himself, the question as to what conditions in the
life of bus conductors and maids might contribute, at least, towards
a rudeness. a rudeness which we are not here trying to defend? If
this question were posed, it would lead to other questions and
problems. One of these is that of identity. How might Stephen be like
and how might he be different from the rude representatives of the
lower classes who insult children? Is his cultivation something which
makes him more tolerant, and if so, how did he attain it? These and a
number of other questions might be asked. It is legitimate for us to
present them here in the analysis of a short story for, let me
repeat, this is a short story which aims to enforce an all inclusive
moral statement; again, the aim of this story is to prove that man
has free will. Finally, it needs to be stated that the setting, the
incidents, the characters do not warrant the author&#8217;s conclusion.
The story is, in reality, not what it seems: it is an expression of
the moods, the retreat from Marxism, the growing moral snobbery of
the advanced and cultivated New York intellectual. As such, it is a
revealing account of the escape of what we might here call <strong>The
Partisan Review</strong> intellectual. It demonstrates what we may expect
in the way of creative literature from those of literary
sensibilities who mix up morals and manners, and see morality, more
or less as a kind of literary stylization. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p>In conclusion, such attitudes, such writing might be contrasted
with the morally vigorous work of the Ibsens, the Dostoevsky of the
past! How the contemporary intellectual is sinking, declining! This
fact alone should be sufficient to warn the most sensitive, the most
alert. the most rebellious spirits of the younger generations of
intellectuals away from such tendencies. For here we see is the high
road that leads to the realms of the most cultivated banality.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#f1" name="n1">1.</a> Cf. my letter of discussion in <strong>Politics</strong>, March 1946. In
the early portion of this essay, I am restating some of the points
which I made in that letter.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f2" name="n2">2.</a> Cf. my article, <em>Tolstoy&#8217;s <strong>War and Peace</strong>
as a Moral Panorama of the Czarist Feudal Nobility</em>, the
<strong>University of Kansas City Review</strong>, Summer 1945.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f3" name="n3">3.</a> Cf., for my view of this, my book, <strong>The League of Frightened
Philistines</strong>, New York 1945.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f4" name="n4">4.</a> In my title essay to <strong>The League of Frightened Philistines</strong>,
I have discussed my views on the way in which critics, such as Van
Wyck Brooks, J. Donald Adams and Archibald MacLeish have moralized
about literature, and will not repeat here</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f5" name="n5">5.</a> I hope that it is needless for me to point out that the
magazine <strong>Partisan Review</strong> has taken the lead in expressing this
kind of esthetico-moral evasion.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f6" name="n6">6.</a> Southern literary Confederates, such as Allen Tate and Donald
Davidson, persist in the expression of this attitude. The movement in
letters which they sponsor, and which is expressed in their books and
in <strong>The Sewanee Review</strong>, edited by Mr. Tate, can be boiled down
to the claim that these literary Confederates have ideas which make
better personalities than is the case with the Yankee writers of the
North who are forever mixing into the affairs of the South and,
thereby, challenging various forms of the expression of the doctrine
of white supremacy.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f7" name="n7">7.</a> In <strong>The Nation</strong> for April 20, 1946, Lionel Trilling
contributed a long attack on Dreiser titled <em>Dreiser and the
Liberal</em>. I urge the reader to peruse this article in connection
with the story. If this is done, one can see what kind of an
alternative literature Trilling can offer to that of Dreiser. This
attack is mean-spirited and unfair. He refers to the question of
anti-Semitism and treats Dreiser as an anti-Semite. It is true that
some years ago letters of Dreiser were published in <strong>The Nation</strong>
which gave definite warrant for such a charge. However, the
sentiments of these letters can nowhere be found in the fiction of
Dreiser. Trilling writes of <strong>The Bulwark</strong>. Like the previous
novels of Dreiser, this work has nothing to do with the Jewish
question. But Trilling introduces anti-Semitism as a means of
criticizing the fiction of Dreiser, and he does this without
evaluating the full career of Dreiser. Also, he mixes up the work of
Dreiser with the favorable views of Dreiser expressed by some
critics, and attacks both as if they could always be equated. In
general, he writes this article in the true spirit of a Matthew
Arnold of the radio program, <em>Invitation to Learning</em>. He
criticizes Dreiser&#8217;s thinking, but he does not show what is the
real relationship between Dreiser&#8217;s thinking and his novels. He
stands at the door of culture, guarding it from such a barbarian.
Inside of the doors of culture we should presumably be able to find
many more works on the level of <em>The Other Margaret</em>. [<strong>Note by ETOL:</strong> In the printed version there is no anchor for this note &#8211; we have placed it in a position that seems to us to be appropriate.]</p>
