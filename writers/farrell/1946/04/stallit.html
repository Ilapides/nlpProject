<hr class="infobot" size="1" noshade />
<p class="fst">The American Stalinists are currently engaged in a heated literary
discussion. Like all previous discussions of this kind, the polemics
read as if they were concerned with a lynch campain or a pogrom. Once
again, the Stalinists are giving a deeper cultural significance to
such words as &#8220;rat,&#8221; &#8220;renegade,&#8221; &#8220;degenerate,&#8221; &#8220;fascist,&#8221;
&#8220;enemy of the peopIe,&#8221; &#8220;enemy of the working class,&#8221; etc. And
now, they are also. adding a new word to the lexicon of literary
criticism &#8211; &#8220;Browderite.&#8221;</p>

<p>For years the Stalinist movement has used literature as a party
instrument. This is the practical significance of their slogan which
holds that &#8220;Art is a weapon.&#8221; On every occasion that the Kremlin
bureaucracy has changed the party line, there has been a
corresponding change in the Stalinist cultural orientation. A study
of the back issues of <strong>New Masses</strong> would clearly document this
fact. In accordance with the party line, practically every
contemporary writer of any significance or reputation has been damned
and praised in this magazine, and often by the same man. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> In
recent years, the social-patriotic Stalinists had a corresponding
cultural orientation corresponding to their politics: this was
expressed in a vague patriotic populism. So long as a writer did not
attack the party line he was allowed a certain latitude in which to
move and yet could be praised and accepted by the Stalinist critics.
With this formally loose policy, which was nonetheless managed with a
bureaucratic whip that would be snapped at any writer who would
threaten to direct a possible criticism at the party line, the
Stalinists built up a broad cultural front of various kinds of fellow
travelers: these included a large number of hack writers, radio
writers, Hollywood scenarists: they gave a seeming political status
to writers who came from cafe society, that upper slum of capitalist
America: they collected pulp writers, detective story writers,
worn-out poets and literary stuffed shirts. Now and then, one of
their alleged critics, such as Samuel Sillen would stuff a few of the
pieties of Marxian phraseology into a book review or an article; now
and then Howard Fast or someone else would pay passing respects to
the dialectic. But withal Stalinist criticism was loosely populist.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The New &#8220;Left&#8221; Line</h4>

<p class="fst">Now the Stalinists have a new line. Their left or pseudo swing is
adventuristic in its emphasis on class struggle, demagogic in its
attack on monopoly capitalism, and, at the same time, it uses this
new leftism to conceal the deepening reaction within the Soviet Union
and as a cover-up for Stalin&#8217;s nationalist-expansionist policies.
The new line was established with the attack on Earl Browder,
yesterday&#8217;s beloved leader. If we would believe the Stalinists,
Browder misled them for years: he derailed them from
Marxist-Leninist-Stalinist theory, imposed a Wall Street line on
them, acted as an alien element within their ranks, and fooled almost
everyone of them. The Communist Party has now expelled Browder. Those
who fawned before him in the most servile spirit only yesterday are
now attacking him with typical Stalinist venom. They call this attack
a defense of Marxism. However, these Stalinists were such independent
thinkers, such morally brave theoreticians, such politically capable
men that almost all of them did not even know that they were fooled.
They only learned that they were not following a Marxist line when a
French Communist named Duclos &#8211; who had never been to America &#8211;
wrote an article in French and told this to them. After Duclos told
them that they were being fooled by Earl Browder, they flung
themselves on the floor and grovelled in penitent confessions. The
spectacle of these Stalinists admitting their errors, vying with one
another in proclaiming their mistakes, announcing what dupes they
were in the hands of their beloved leader &#8211; this furnished us with
one of the most obscene political spectacles in recent political
history. It was a variation of the Moscow Trials, a minor American
Moscow Trial in itself. Now, however, they have confessed. Having
done this, they are now &#8220;Marxists&#8221; again.</p>

<p>The literary discussion which they have now opened is, in essence,
a concomitant of these developments. It is the literary and cultural
corollary of their turn from social patriotism to demagogic leftism.
In essence, then, it is a cultural swing from social-patriotic
cultural populism to bureaucratic, leftist cultural &#8220;class
struggle.&#8221; This is the way it must be understood.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p class="fst">If we read <strong>New Masses</strong>, it seems that this new literary
discussion began, believe it or not again, with problems of
conscience. Back on October 23rd, Isidor Schneider wrote about the
problems of conscience of the left writer. This problem is, briefly,
to be seen in the moral dilemma &#8211; should he write art or should he
write journalistic political propaganda? What should he do if the two
don&#8217;t seem to mix?</p>

<p>Concerned with this problem of conscience the Stalinist writer
Albert Maltz contributed a rather long piece, <em>What Shall We Ask of
Writers?</em> to <strong>New Masses</strong> of February 12. Maltz&#8217;s article
was theoretically unclear and, in consequence, somewhat confusing.
His confusion, however, was an old one in Stalinist writing. He could
not distinguish between the politics of a writer and the art of a
writer, and in consequence, he left them completely separated, and he
argued that, in <strong>New Masses</strong>, the critics should discuss art in
the book reviews, and that the editors, on the editorial page, should
criticize if they deemed this necessary the politics of the same
writer. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> He distinguished between the writer as a citizen and as
an artist. Then he urged that a writer could be a good or even a
great literary artist and at the same time, a bad citizen. He
appealed to the authority of Engels and to the example of Engels
admiration for Balzac, who was a monarchist in the period of the
Restoration. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> He then cited some modern examples, and in his
citations, he committed the unfortunate blunder of using me as his
major instance. He praised some of my work, declared that he did not
approve of the committees to which I belong, and also stated:
&#8220;Farrell&#8217;s name was a bright pennant in <strong>New Masses</strong> until
he became hostile to the <strong>New Masses</strong>.&#8221; <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> He spoke,
similarly, of Richard Wright. He argued that the novels of Wright and
myself are to be considered differently than those of Arthur
Koestler&#8217;s. Koestler, he declared, &#8220;always writes with a
political purpose so organic to his work that it affects his
rendering of character.&#8221; And, most inexcusably Maltz added that the
literary future of Wright, and of myself, could not be predicted: in
other words, he left it as an open question as to whether or not we
were degenerated literary artists.</p>

<p>At the same time, Maltz complained of the &#8220;straitjacket&#8221; into
which Stalinist critics were constantly trying to put the writer. He
explained this straitjacket criticism by attributing it to the narrow
application of the formula &#8211; &#8220;art is a weapon.&#8221; He declared he
agreed with this &#8220;doctrine&#8221; broadly, but that it has been abused
and applied in the narrowest fashion. This, he affirmed, created
endless difficulties for the writer. He confessed that it has created
for him these problems of conscience of which Schneider spoke. Of
course, it has for long been no secret that the Stalinists apply
constant pressure on any writer who will allow them to do so.
Nonetheless, it is important to note that Maltz &#8211; a loyal, patient,
plodding Stalinist writer of fifteen or more years&#8217; duration &#8211;
here admitted everything that critics of Stalinist literary practices
long knew and stated in print. Maltz charged that these practices
produced &#8220;schematic writing,&#8221; &#8220;wasted writing&#8221;; he spoke
of the results as a &#8220;calamity&#8221;; he stated that they aided in the
production of works which were politically shallow as well as
artistically inferior. He also remarked that as a consequence of this
atmosphere the creative power of the writer was deformed.</p>

<p>Listen to him:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I know of at least a dozen plays and novels, discarded
in the process of writing because the political scene altered.
Obviously the authors in question were not primarily bent upon
portraying abiding truths, either of character or of the social
scene, but were mainly concerned with advancing a political tactic
through the manipulation of character. Otherwise, a new headline in
the newspapers would not have made them discard their work. I even
know of a historian who read Duclos and announced that he would have
to revise completely the book he was engaged upon.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Fate of Young Writers</h4>

<p class="fst">This all reveals that the Stalinists use literature as a weapon of
political tactics. The Stalinist cultural movement has always been
the graveyard of promising literary talent. In the early 30&#8217;s, for
instance, there was a burst of creative energy: there were little
magazines all over the country; young left wing writers were
numerous; the Communist Party bragged about helping them; Michael
Gold, Granville Hicks (whom Gold of course defended when writers such
as myself attacked him) and others saw the future of American
literature in these young writers. Where are most of them now? What
has happened to them? <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> The Stalinists have to create anew, and
almost from the ground up, the same kind of movement they once helped
to create. For this they must find new talents. The old talents of
the 1930&#8217;s are almost all dried up. After all, living creative
literature depends on creative effort, creative works more than it
does on critical dicta. The new line which the Stalinists are now
starting to lay down is something like that of their third period.
This was proved a failure in practice. When writers were imposed on
by the Stalinist literary bureaucrats, they fought back, and often
they left the Stalinists bag and baggage. When writers were found who
would write according to the proscriptions laid down for them, it
became an almost insuperable task for the bureaucratic critics to get
anyone to read their books. And with changes in the world political
situation, this line was abandoned. The little magazines were
liquidated. Archibald MacLeish, once described as a &#8220;fascist&#8221; by
Mike Gold, and similar writers were courted, and the promising young
left wing writers were shoved into the background, to be treated like
poor relations.</p>

<p>Albert Maltz himself states that he is not an aesthetician and
that, perhaps, some of his formulations may not be sufficiently
precise, but urges the reader to consider his main point. He asks
that the writer be given greater freedom and that his work be not
judged in terms of the immediate political needs of the movement.
With this, it is obvious that anyone with the least bit of sense will
agree, if he is not dragooned into disagreeing by Stalinist
functionaries and party line critics. However, the way in which Maltz
discusses his problems leaves the whole issue open to various confusions.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Literature and Politics</h4>

<p class="fst">I can only comment on this is passing. The general relationships
between literature and politics is a question which is both
theoretical and empirical. It demands theoretical analysis and
investigation. In this context, it is a problem involving the
relationship, the series of correlations among different types of
human activities. In correlating literature and politics, it is
necessary to investigate the problem historically and to note what
has been the case in different periods of the past; and further it is
necessary to note the differences between the problems of politics
and the problems of literature. And, in tum, such an investigation
requires that the investigator have his own values, that is that he
be clear on what he wants for himself and for other men. If
complicated problems of this kind are reduced to the question of
applying political tactics, the entire discussion is most likely to
be arid.</p>

<p>Finally, the state of consciousness of a period must be taken into
account. The level of education in a society, the variations of level
of education among the members of different classes, the context of
the emotional problems of different persons in a society, all of this
must be taken into account if one deals in the formulation of
perspectives for writers and critics.</p>

<p>Maltz does not see the problem as so involved and as complicated
as I have here indicated. He approaches it from the standpoint of a
writer who has sat between two stools for years; a writer who has
tried to be an artist and a party liner at the same time. He presents
the problems from the standpoint of the dilemma which Stalinism
imposes on loyal writers. In doing this he urges that more freedom be
allowed to Stalinist writers. His appeal is better late than never
and, in itself, it ought to be supported by the adversaries of
Stalinism. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> In this sense, it is to be welcomed. But if Stalinist
writers feel more free, they will strive more earnestly to understand
themselves and the world around them, and they will write in such a
way as to aid in blowing up some of the false claims of Stalinism.
Because of such possible consequences of freedom, the Stalinists have
to discredit Maltz. To confirm this, I need merely to point out that
in practically every case where a writer refuses to let the
Stalinists tell him what to think, they attack him and declare over
and over again <em>ad nauseam</em> that he has degenerated
artistically. In order to try to give the least warrant to such
charges, they need to attack a writer&#8217;s character; they need to
castigate him for his political views: they need to put him into an
amalgam with fascists, reactionaries and so on. Then, without
analyzing his work, without letting their doped readers have any real
idea of what they are doing, they correlate a literary production
with political actions, real or invented. At present, in their
ferocious attacks on Maltz, they are using Richard Wright, John Dos
Passos, Koestler, Silone and myself as scapegoats. Without showing
differences in the books and in the orientations of all these
writers, they are all lumped together as degenerates; and then the
name of Ezra Pound is added to give a finishing touch to the amalgam.
And to cap the climax, this is literary &#8220;Trotskyism.&#8221; Why?
Because by using this word here, they can then give a pretense of
proof of their charge. They can cite the official version of the
Moscow Trials as seeming proof. Ergo! writers are conspirators.</p>

<p>What Maltz was really trying to do in this article was to get the
Stalinist bureaucrats to give him a little more literary freedom and,
at the same time, to win from them permission to admire in public the
same books he appreciates in private. But this is what he put his
foot into: this is, also, a revelation of the reason why Stalinists
don&#8217;t want writers to create freely. Further, the na&#239;vet&#233; of
Maltz suggests how little Stalinism can educate the writer. How is it
to be explained, for instance, that a writer like Maltz can be in
this allegedly Marxist movement for something like fifteen years and
yet he cannot learn from it, with all of its alleged theory, how to
pose questions clearly, how to think about his own questions with
some rigorousness. Year in and year out, the Stalinists have appealed
to the writer, on the ground that they can help him in his work.
Maltz exposes this appeal. He exposes it in his very person. The
looseness of his article shows how little Stalinism has taught him.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p class="fst">I have indicated the nature of the reaction to Maltz&#8217;s article.
In the same issue as that in which it appears, Isidor Schneider,
literary editor of <strong>New Masses</strong>, also contributed one dealing
with these same problems, <em>Background to Error</em>. Here, I do not
have space to discuss Schneider&#8217;s article. Suffice it to say that
he didn&#8217;t take sharp issue with Maltz, didn&#8217;t correct him for
praising &#8220;renegade&#8221; writers and, in fact, he didn&#8217;t really
disagree with Maltz. Rather, he tried to show that there was more to
be said on the questions and that the political and historical
conditions had forced these errors on the Stalinist movement. He
called for both a party apparatus literature and culture, and a freer
fellow traveler one of the type that Maltz wants. In this sense, he
said yes and he said no, and in order to do this, he wrote a new
version of the Stalinist cultural past in America. Inasmuch as the
dialectic has been introduced into this controversy by Howard Fast
and others, I might apply it to Schneider. Schneider does not know if
he is yes, and doesn&#8217;t know if he is no. Hegel used the word
&#8220;chemism&#8221; to describe this condition of dialectical tension. It
fits Schneider. He is a man turned into a dialectical chemism and he
hangs suspended in dialectical <em>extremis</em> waiting until he is
told whether he is yes, or whether he is no.</p>

<p>More importantly, it is significant to observe that Schneider has
not been subjected to the same attacks as has Maltz. On the face of
it, the situation suggests that poor Maltz was maneuevered into
becoming a scapegoat. He can, thus, be turned into a horrible example
of the dangers of &#8220;Browderism,&#8221; &#8220;Trotskyism,&#8221; &#8220;anti-Marxism,&#8221;
&#8220;fascism.&#8221; If other Stalinist writers yearn. to be as free as
Maltz, they have received in advance an impressive warning that they
had better keep their mouths shut.</p>

<p>Now, let me comment briefly on the nature of the attacks directed
against Maltz. In a political report on the expulsion of Browder,
Robert Thompson, a party functionary, characterized Maltz&#8217;s article
as &#8220;Trotskyite.&#8221; Samuel Sillen, an alleged critic, wrote a series
of articles in the <strong>Daily Worker</strong>. Leaving aside his attacks on
myself, Sillen&#8217;s articles are cut to the typical bureaucratic
pattern. He states Marxist propositions in a generalized and slovenly
manner, and associates himself with these propositions. He does not
render them concrete in any manner. Then he hides behind Lenin. This
is achieved by quotations. In consequence of this, if Maltz does not
agree with Sillen, Maltz is, presumably, attacking Lenin. At the same
time, Sillen piously admits that errors have been. made, and even
admits that the Stalinist critics, himself included, were misled by
Browder. In fact, in the late 1930&#8217;s, Sillen was describing Browder
as the continuation of the American tradition, and when writing about
literature, he would quote Lenin, quote or paraphrase Browder,
associate them and present his own slovenly banalities as an
extension of the views of Lenin and Browder. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> Withal, the
following point can, suffice in, a discussion of Sillen. He says that
Browder misled him; he admits that errors were made by himself and
others. Then, what guarantee should anyone have that he is not now
being misled, that he is not making new mistakes? Why should he be
taken seriously, even by his own comrades, when he was so easily
fooled by Browder? Here is a passing sample of the meaningless drivel
which he presents in Marxist language:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Let us remember that the solution of our problem
requires not a retreat from Marxism, but an ever more vigilant and
militant struggle for Marxism in theory and practice.&#8221; <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In <strong>New Masses</strong> for February 26th, Joseph North, one of the
editors of <strong>New Masses,</strong> contributed an article, <em>No Retreat
for the Writer</em>. North has been a party journalist and editor for
fifteen years or more. In this period he has justified every zigzag,
every change of line! His capacity to think what he is told to think
has had no apparent effect on his duodenum, his arteries, his heart &#8211;
or his brain. He is a journalistic example of how a man can flourish
if he is obedient. He has always been a mere journalist. Here he
shines forth as if he were a theoretician. In the usual pattern of
the third period, he opens his article by talking of world crisis.
This pattern puts onto the shoulders of the writer the burden of the
crisis. He must be responsible. Hence, he must do what North says,
just as North does what he is told to do. For the rest, North admits
that he and his comrades have all made errors, and he states that
they are all earnestly searching for clarity. But why? North has
been, as he admits, a true Marxist for years. He has the Marxist
science to teach him. He, along with endless others, have been
denouncing all opponents for not being Marxist. Their denunciations
of writers have been reprehensible, shameful. And North denounces
anew in the same old spirit. He denounces me, he denounces Maltz. And
yet, he declares that he doesn&#8217;t have all of the answers, that he
is groping for Marxist clarity. His humility would be touching if he
were not so insolent. He admits his incompetence to discuss the
questions at issue. And then, he launches forth into vituperation.
Searching for Marxist truth that he admits he has not found, he
interprets Maltz&#8217;s article as one which could well &#8220;destroy the
fruitful tree of Marxism.&#8221; North&#8217;s article is irrelevant to all
theory. It has one real purpose, that of laying down anew the Moscow
trial amalgam in <strong>New Masses</strong>. Furthermore, it needs to be
pointed out that North, as a responsible editor of <strong>New Masses</strong>,
allowed Maltz&#8217;s article to be printed. He is, in the eyes of his
comrades, a man who wittingly or otherwise allowed what is now called
a &#8220;Trotskyite&#8221; article to appear in <strong>New Masses</strong>. This leads
me to remark that he had better hurry up and gain the Marxist clarity
that he searches for in print.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The &#8220;High-Falutin&#8221; Touch</h4>

<p class="fst">North, Sillen, Gold are merely routine in their attempts to refute
Maltz. The real blow against the poor fellow is delivered by the
writer, Howard Fast. Fast is not only the white-haired boy of the
Stalinist cultural front: he is also one of the most distinguished
cold storage patriots in these United States. And it is he who gives
the high-falutin touch of art and theory to the controversy.
Alongside of the North article he writes one entitled <em>Art and
Politics</em>. He charges that Maltz rests his article on a platitude;
that Maltz doesn&#8217;t quote Engels (which he doesn&#8217;t either, if it
means anything); that Maltz&#8217;s proposals will liquidate the Marxist
and the whole progressive movement in America; that Maltz does not
know how to think; that Maltz praises Trotskyites; that Maltz&#8217;s
formulations are &#8220;shoddy,&#8221; and that all of this leads to the road
of sterility, whether it be that of fascism, neo-fascism, or of mere
mediocrity. But that is merely a detail. In showing up Maltz, and
giving us some real theory, Fast tells us: &#8220;One must look deeper
than the obvious.&#8221; And then, at the same time that he &#8220;destroys&#8221;
Maltz, he also says: &#8220;Of course, we are not free from critical
mistakes, vulgarity, incompetence; that we know, and the reasons for
the situation are manifold. Some of these critical failings we have
corrected; others we will correct.&#8221; But he is sweating with
profundity so intensively that he just doesn&#8217;t go into details on
the vulgarity, incompetence and mistakes to which he confesses. And
we can be sure he will correct them, for he belongs to the Left, and
how could mistakes not be corrected when you consider that &#8220;The
Left has never denied change; it strives to understand change, which
is the very essence of dialectics.&#8221; But then, after showing that
Maltz doesn&#8217;t know much about the theory of art, speaking of that
&#8220;far from admirable trio, Farrell, Wright and Koestler,&#8221; and
indulging in various types of literary Fancy-Dan shadow boxing, he
dives down so much deeper than the obvious that he breaks what little
head he has. Listen to him clinch his analysis with this lecture on art:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The writer, however, has a singular responsibility;for
he must select from life those factors which suit his purpose; he
must turn them into word-pictures and thought-pictures; and he must
arrange them on paper in such juxtaposition taking into consideration
rhythm and emotion of sound and beauty of phrase, as to achieve that
rare and splendid result we call art. Sometimes he succeeds,
sometimes he does not; for in the best of worlds, art is not common.
But unless he can engage in his original selection with a degree of
clarity and understanding, and unless he can bring to his appraisal
of life that relationship with life which we call philosophy, he will
fail &#8211; even if he has the talent of the gods.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Believe it or not, this paragraph of Fast&#8217;s is the high-water
mark of the controversy. And Howard Fast most bravely hurls it into
the face of writers who are &#8220;far from admirable,&#8221; who are sterile
mediocrities, who are &#8220;reactionary.&#8221; The cream of the jest here
is that it is completely compatible with all that. Maltz has to say
if Maltz will only stop approving of Trotskyite books such as <strong>Studs
Lonigan</strong> and <strong>Black Boy</strong>. After pother, denunciations,
confessions, admission of errors, promises to do penance and then
more denunciations, the formal content of the controversy &#8211; as
distinguished from its political character &#8211; all boils down to a
vague, pretentious and almost vacuous banality.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p class="note"><a href="#f1" name="n1">1.</a> Cf. <em><strong>New Masses</strong>: Friends and Enemies</em>, by
Herbert Solow, <strong>Partisan Review</strong>, March 1938. Solow made a brief
and amusing little study of just this point. His article began: &#8220;The
Communist Party &#8211; the <strong>New Masses</strong> in the literary field &#8211; is
never content to &#8216;prove conclusively&#8217; that all critics of Moscow
executions, the People&#8217;s Front or the American Writers Congress are
fascist agents.&#8221; Solow pointed out, then, how many &#8220;enemies of
mankind&#8221; were former contributors to <strong>New Masses</strong> itself. He
found that a number of writers were in this category. Also, he quoted
from reviews of various writers at different periods, indicating how
literary judgments had changed with the changes in the political
line. The most amusing (but in a grisly way) instance of this which I
know is the following. In 1935, Edwin Seaver praised and tried to
apply views on literature which were expressed by Bukharin and Radek.
I criticized these in my book, <strong>A Note on Literary Criticism</strong>.
Seaver solidarized himself on literature with Bukharin and Radek.
Shortly afterward, Bukharin and Radek were put on trial in Moscow.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f2" name="n2">2.</a> I have tried to present my views on some aspects of these
problems in my books, <strong>A Note on Literary Criticism</strong>, <strong>op.
cit.</strong>, and <strong>The League of Frightened Philistines</strong>, New York,
1945. I hope I shall have the time to deal further with these
problems in the future.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f3" name="n3">3.</a> Although I agree with the comments of Marx and Engels on
Balzac, I should like to add that by 1946 it is time for one to be
able to like a book and yet not like the politics of the author,
without having to support oneself by repeating that Marx and Engels
admired Balzac. What are we to say of the moral character, the
intelligence, the independent of spirit of people who can&#8217;t say in
public that they found interest or value in some work of art without,
also, feeling constrained to, support their admiration by this
argument from authority?</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f4" name="n4">4.</a> In <strong>New Masses</strong>, August 19, 1936, I had a controversy with
Isidor Schneider somewhat similar to this new one of Maltz&#8217;s. I
suggest that the reader compare what Schneider said then with his
statements in <em>Background to Error</em>, <strong>New Masses</strong>, February
12, 1946. I would add that the common practice of <strong>New Masses</strong>
critics is that of admitting errors in general when they are
criticized. and of then discrediting the particular critic by
accusing him of wanting to liquidate Marxism.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f5" name="n5">5.</a> In an article, <em>The Last American Writers Congress</em>,
printed in the <strong>Saturday Review of Literature</strong>, June 5, 1937. I
discussed this point. I cited a number of the young writers whom the
Stalinists hailed as promising in 1935, and noted on the meager
quantity of the work they had produced. I further indicated that this
was the case even though they had affirmed a view on literary
creation which demanded that they show great fertility.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f6" name="n6">6.</a> Merely for the record, and in no spirit of vengeance, I think
it must be set down here that during all the years when Maltz
patiently, ploddingly, loyally followed the party line, fellow
writers of his were denounced and slandered because they tried to
maintain their independence. Maltz was, then, silent on all of these
questions. His silence now rebounds on him, for he is given the same
treatment which he silently watched others receive. We might ask &#8211;
how many others remained timidly silent because of the silence of
Maltz and of others who may share his views?</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f7" name="n7">7.</a> Browder, when he delivered speeches to writers at writers&#8217;
congresses, always managed to say precisely nothing. However, in
1937, he did launch into a vicious attack on Waldo Frank because the
latter had, in a most feeble manner, asked some questions which
implied the possibility of doubt concerning the official version of
the Moscow Trials. Here, Browder himself laid out the lines of the
amalgam for writers, and to this day that same amalgam is being used.
It is a little gruesome to think that Browder is now being put into
his own amalgam.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f8" name="n8">8.</a> I&#8217;d make bold to remark that Engels would have described the
writings of people like Sillen as rubbish. For that was how he
described the parallel drivel of the Sillens of his own day.</p>
