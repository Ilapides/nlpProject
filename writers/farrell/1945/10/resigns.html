<p class="fst">Dear George:</p>

<p class="fst">With this letter, I am tendering my immediate resignation as chairman of The Civil Rights Defense Committee; however, I am not resigning from the. Committee proper.</p>

<p>I have received no communications from the CRDC office since last January. To my knowledge, the Committee has been inactive since early in the winter of 1945, when the last, of the Minneapolis defendants returned from prison. Thus, it seems to me that the CRDC has now become merely a paper organization, and that my sole remaining role as its Chairman is that of having my name on its stationery.</p>

<p>I assume that I have performed my function as Chairman, and; that there is no further work for me to do, I am, therefore, resigning.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I stand ready to offer any effective collaboration, that I can in the event of future defense cases,</p>

</table>

<p>P.S. &#8211; I take it that copies of this letter will be sent to all members of the Committee so, that they may be informed of this fact.</p>
