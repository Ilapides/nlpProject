<h2>James T. Farrell</h2>

<h1>A Portrait of James Connolly</h1>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<h2>III. Connolly&#8217;s Democratic Views</h2>

<h4><em>New International</em>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/issue3.htm#ni48_02" target="new">Vol. 14 No. 2</a>, February 1948</h4>

<p class="fst">Writing about Dublin in the early twentieth century in <strong>The
Reconquest of Ireland</strong>, James Connolly declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is, indeed, strange that the people of a nation
which has known indomitable determination in its struggle for
possession of the mere machinery of government should exhibit so little
capacity to breathe a civic soul into such portions of the machinery as
they had already brought under their control.&#8221; <a id="f1" href="#n1"
name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This quotation is but one of many which could be taken
from Connolly&#8217;s writings in order to suggest the thoroughgoing
character of his democratic views. It was Connolly, the Socialist, who
explained and developed democratic views perhaps more fully than any
Irish political figure of his time. A working-class and trade-union
leader, Connolly brought democratic ideas of leadership and democratic
conceptions of a rank and file into the Irish rebellion.</p>

<p>The difference between the Fenian Brotherhood of the nineteenth
century and the Irish Citizen Army would indicate this. The former was
organized along the lines of a secret society, and the reins of control
were centered in the leadership. When the Fenians were ready to strike
a blow the leadership hesitated in making a decision; the Fenians
missed their opportunity and disappeared from history. <a id="f2"
href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p>We have already noted that before the Irish Citizen Army went
through with the Easter Rebellion, Connolly gave every member an
opportunity to decide on whether to go along in the struggle or drop
out. The Irish Citizen Army, despite its democracy, disappeared from
history as did the Fenians. But it left an addition to the legacy of
the Fenians and to the entire tradition of the Irish national rebellion &#8211; a legacy of democracy in thought and practice.</p>

<p>At the present time many socialists think of democracy mainly in
relationship to a democratic party organization and to the ideal of
developing a democratic internal life in left party organizations and
movements. This is important. But democratic socialist thinking should
require a broader interest, and at the same time it should dictate a
concern with those small practical details of organizing life which are
now viewed in a routine manner, if not with outright cynicism.
Socialism should sponsor ideas of a genuine civic consciousness which
is preached but not practiced in our own time. Connolly&#8217;s remarks in
the above quotation reveal his own sense of civic consciousness &#8211; of
municipal patriotism, if one will.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this essay [see earlier articles], I spoke of
the recurrent division in the history of the Irish national revolution,
a division on the question: Does the political or the social question
come first? Connolly, as we know, belonged to the tradition of Irish
rebels who stressed the social question. But his stress was not made
merely in large and broad terms. He drew conclusions from his social
position which he applied in small matters as well as in large ones.
His ideas on civic consciousness derived from his social views. They
were expressions of his socialist position.</p>

<p>Connolly valued all rights and liberties too sincerely to want to
see them wasted. He observed that after the Irish had gained democratic
rights in municipal affairs, they did not use these rights; they
demonstrated a lack of civic consciousness. Wanting national
sovereignty, they were badly utilizing the voting rights which they had
already gained. And Connolly&#8217;s discussion and criticism here served as
a means for an illuminating socialist discussion of democracy.</p>

<p>Connolly, let me repeat, was most thoroughgoing in his democratic
thoughts and ideas. Thus, in writing of &#8216;the function of public bodies
as a governing factor in Irish municipal politics,&#8217; Connolly emphasized
that these functions of public bodies should be seen and used not
merely as offensive political weapons to be won from an enemy, but also
as &#8220;effective tools to be used in the upbuilding of a healthier social
edifice in which to give effect to the needs of the citizens for
associative aids to their individual development and culture.&#8221; It is a
commonplace to remind readers that Marx&#8217;s real starting point was the
ideal of a society which would permit the fullest and freest
development of the human personality. Such an ideal was central in the
mind of James Connolly. He would use every democratic gain as a means
of contributing toward the development and culture of the Irish people.
All political action was a means to be used in creating a freer society
in which the individual could live and develop in dignity. During the
First World War he wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We believe that in times of peace we should work
along the lines of peace to strengthen the nation, and we believe that
whatever strengthens and elevates the working class strengthens the
nation.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;But we also believe that in times of war we should
act as in war. We despise, entirely loathe and despise, all the
mouthings and mouthers about war who infest Ireland in times of peace,
just as we despise and loathe all the cantings about caution and
restraint to which the same people treat us in times of war.&#8221; <a
id="f3" href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Connolly did not see violence as an end, nor did he love
violence as some rebel spirits seem to love it. Likewise, he did not
see power as an end in itself. He visioned a nation, a society, a world
in which men and women, living with dignity, would be healthier than
they are, better fed, better educated, more cooperative.</p>

<p>This vision was neither Utopian nor millennial. He would not
compromise with the principles on which this vision, this ultimate aim,
was based. But he would not, at the same time, scorn any immediate
rights and advantages that could be gained. Immediate democratic gains
were means toward greater gains; and they could also become tools for
trying to lift the cultural level of the people immediately. In times
of peace, he did not scorn means of peace in order to talk of weapons
of war which he did not yet possess.</p>

<p>Thus, ideas of civic consciousness and municipal patriotism were no
mere platitudes to him. They were integral in his broader social and
human attitudes which embodied a clear conception of social
responsibility. Thus he wrote that &#8220;We require in Ireland to grasp the
fact that the act of voting at the ballot box is the one act in which
we get the opportunity to give expression to the soul of the race ...
The ballot box is the vehicle of expression of our social
consciousness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like almost all, if not all, great revolutionaries, Connolly was an
educator. And he saw in the practices of democracy a means of educating
the people. In effect, his political teaching on democracy served as a
way of preparing the people for the exercise of power. Just as he
studied revolutions of the past and wrote articles on these in order to
teach Irish workingmen how to prepare for the rising which came in
1916, so at an earlier period he tried to teach the Irish masses how to
exercise democratic rights, how to use these rights in order to provide
for and improve the conditions of their own welfare.</p>

<p>He knew too well the price of liberty to be cynical about any
liberties which had already been won. Thus, he wrote in <strong>The
Re-Conquest of Ireland</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Assuredly it was within the realm of probability
that a people suffering under the smart of intolerable conditions
caused by a misuse of political power and social privilege should at
the first opportunity set itself to the task of sweeping away such
conditions by a public-spirited use of their newly-acquired control of
municipal powers.&#8221; <a id="f4" href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But such did not happen when the Irish gained democratic
rights.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;If today the cities and towns of Ireland are a
reproach to the land and a glaring evidence of the incapacity of the
municipal rulers of the country, the responsibility for the failure
lies largely with those who in the past had control of the political
education of the Irish masses and failed to prepare them for the
intelligent exercise of those public powers for which they were taught
to clamor.&#8221; <a id="f5" href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">And need we emphasize that observations of such a
character lead to the basic conclusion which Connolly repeated over and
over again &#8211; labor must take the lead in the Irish struggle.</p>

<p>In April, 1916, shortly before the Easter Rebellion, he declared:
&#8220;The cause of Labor is the cause of Ireland, the cause of Ireland is
the cause of labor.&#8221; <a id="f6" href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> And that
cause was one to bring dignity into human life. The general welfare,
the dignity of man, this was the cause of socialism. It was at the same
time the cause of democracy. The democratic tradition of the French
Revolution, which was inherited by predecessors of Connolly, Tone,
Emmet, the Young Irelanders of &#8217;48, Lalor and Davitt, was absorbed by
Connolly.</p>

<p>And no matter what aspect of Connolly&#8217;s social and political
thinking we take, we see how it was always admirably consistent.
However, his was not the formal consistency of a sectarian who disdains
all struggles for immediate gains on the ground that such gains will
not necessarily mean socialism; nor was it the consistency of a
critical theoretician who was never forced to act, to take decisions
involving the greatest risks. It was the consistency of a dedicated and
devoted man who had committed himself to go the long, hard and
dangerous road that is demanded of all who want men really to be free.</p>

<p>At the same time we can see, in Connolly&#8217;s consistency, his love of
the people. Connolly&#8217;s indignation always flared when he learned of
injustice, of indignities heaped on the people. And his was an
indignation different in quality from that of some contemporary
Marxists whose greatest anger seems to come when they discover a
theoretical error in the writings of an adversary. Unlike Connolly&#8217;s,
theirs is an indignation of self-love. It has contributed toward
poisoning the streams of modern socialist thought. Connolly&#8217;s
consistency is a consistency based on love, on a realization of common
identity between himself and the workers whom he led. It is this
feeling of common identity which further motivates his conception of
democracy.</p>
