<h2>James T. Farrell</h2>

<h1>A Portrait of James Connolly</h1>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<h2>IV. The Politics of Connolly&#8217;s Catholicism</h2>

<h4><em>New International</em>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/issue3.htm#ni48_03" target="new">Vol. 14 No. 3</a>, March 1948</h4>

<p class="fst">The historic experiences of Ireland as a subject and
exploited nation can be described as the other and non-progressive side
of the rise of English capitalism and the Industrial Revolution.</p>

<p>If we look at England, without in any way minimizing the horrors of
the new industrialism, we can see the advances made with the rise of
capitalism. There was an enormous economic development and, in
addition, there were real political gains of a democratic character.
England became one of the most democratic countries in the world.</p>

<p>But if we look at Ireland, it is much harder to see these advances.
Here was a nation invaded and despoiled by foreigners. Its industry was
smashed. Its people were driven off the land and out of the country.
Its clan system was broken up. The faith of its fathers was ruthlessly
abused by the despoiling invaders who were also the professors of an
antagonistic religious creed.</p>

<p>Consider these facts &#8211; which are but roughly and hastily generalized
here but which were vivid, concrete and intimate to generations of the
Irish &#8211; and it should not be difficult to understand how and why
Catholic Irishmen would not see the progressive side of the
Reformation. That liberty of conscience which has historically been so
influenced by the rise of Protestantism had to be defended and fought
for by Catholics. In their own country, Irish Catholics lost their
citizenship. They were exiles in their own country, and in fact it can
be said that here are the historic roots of that melancholy sense of
alienation which is to be found, even to this day, in so many Irish and
even in Irish-Americans who are far removed in space and time from
remote and oppressed Catholic Irish ancestors.</p>

<p>Sean O&#8217;Faolain, in his biography of Daniel O&#8217;Connell, <strong>King
of the Beggars</strong>, writes of Catholic relief bills prior to the
rise of O&#8217;Connell as a political leader: &#8220;After 1771 an Irishman might
lease a bog for a brief period, if it was a mile from a town ... and if
the lessee guaranteed to reclaim at least half of his bogland within
twenty-one years.&#8221; And after 1782, as O&#8217;Faolain also wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;A Catholic, i.e., one of the people was suddenly
acknowledged as a species of citizen, if a very inferior species of
citizen; so inferior that our historians of Dublin under the Georges
have been unable to find a single detail about the people, and all we
can gather about them is to be inferred from the contemporary theatre
in which they begin to appear as the faithful, if rather foolish,
servant ... every office was closed to the native &#8211; unless he
apostatized &#8211; the army, the law, and the civil service &#8211; though he
could become a doctor in private practice, or open an apothecary&#8217;s
shop. Not until 1793 ... could a native Irishman enter the army ... But
he could take neither hand, act, nor part in the government of his
country ... He walked with the word Pariah branded on his forehead.&#8221; <a
id="f1" href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">One could add many details concerning the persecution of
Catholics, including the clergy, and the ways in which religious
persecution was linked with national and social oppression. Connolly
himself, in <strong>Labour in Irish History</strong>, wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;War, religion, race, language, political reform,
patriotism &#8211; apart from whatever intrinsic merits they may possess &#8211; all serve in the hands of the possessing class as counter-irritants,
whose function is to avert the catastrophe of social revolution by
engendering heat in such parts of the body politic as are farthest
removed from the seat of economic inquiry.&#8221; <a id="f2" href="#n2"
name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">England is noted in the history books for having
perfected the technique of divide-and-rule in modern times. The policy
of ruling an oppressed nation or race by dividing it was worked out, as
it were, in the terrible empirical-historical situation of Britain&#8217;s
seven-century rule of Ireland.</p>

<p>The Irish were, then, beggared and oppressed for a long period. The
horrible conditions of life in Ireland in the eighteenth century were
revealed in Swift&#8217;s masterpiece of irony and sarcasm, <strong>A Modest
Proposal for Preventing the Children of the Poor People in Ireland from
Becoming a Burden on their Parents or Country, and for Making them
Beneficial to the Public</strong>. This began:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is a melancholy Object to those, who walk
through this great Town [Dublin], or travel in the Country, when they
see the <em>Streets</em>, the <em>Roads</em>, and <em>Cabbin-Doors</em>,
crowded with <em>Beggars</em> of the female Sex, followed by three,
four or six Children, <em>all in Rags</em>, and importuning every
Passenger for an Alms. These <em>Mothers</em> instead of being able to
work for their honest livelihood, are forced to employ all their time
in Strolling, to beg Sustenance for their <em>helpless Infants</em>,
who, as they grow up, either turn <em>Thieves</em> for want of work,
or leave their <em>dear native country</em> to fight <em>for the
Pretender in Spain</em>, or else sell themselves to the <em>Barbadoes</em>.&#8221;
<a id="f3" href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Swift proposed to find &#8220;a fair, cheap and easy method of
making these Children sound and useful Members of the commonwealth.&#8221;
And he found a way whereby these children could be used to &#8220;contribute
to the Feeding and partly to the Clothing of many Thousands.&#8221;
Calculating that there were about 120,000 children of the poor born
annually, Dean Swift pointed out that this number could not all support
themselves by agricultural and handicraft work or by thievery. Thus the
children, when they reach the age of one, would become &#8220;a most
delicious, nourishing, and wholesome Food, whether <em>Stewed</em>, <em>Roasted</em>,
<em>Baked</em>, or <em>Boyled</em>, and ... it will equally serve in a
<em>Fricassie</em>, or a <em>Ragoust</em> ...&#8221; One hundred thousand of
these children could be so disposed of, and since as food they would be
dear, they would be &#8220;very <em>proper for Landlords</em>, who, as they
have already devoured most of the Parents, seem to have the best Title
to the children.&#8221; <a id="f4" href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p>This enterprise would be profitable all around, it would even give
the mothers a profit, and Swift also suggested that &#8220;Those who are most
<em>thrifty</em> ... may flay the Carcass; the Skin of which,
artificially dressed, will make admirable <em>Gloves for Ladies</em>,
and <em>Summer Boots for fine Gentlemen</em>.&#8221; Swift, with his
melancholy and savage genius, revealed the essential features of the
Irish problem. Ireland was despoiled as a cognate part of the
capitalist advance of England. Swift&#8217;s sarcasm draws this out with a
genius that has been, to my mind, unmatched in centuries.</p>

<p>At the same time that we consider this long historic oppression, it
is necessary to remember that even in national oppression there were
class differences. Connolly pointed this out. He noted that the poor
Protestants as well as the poor Catholics were oppressed and exploited
in Ireland, and he declared, in <strong>Labour in Irish History</strong>,
that the Penal Laws against the Irish</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;did indeed make the life of propertied Catholics
more insecure than would otherwise have been the case; but to the vast
mass of the population the misery and hardship entailed by the working
out of economic laws were fraught with infinitely more suffering than
it was at any time within the power of the Penal Laws to inflict. As a
matter of fact, the effect of the latter code in impoverishing wealthy
Catholics has been much overrated. The class interests which at all
times unite the propertied section of the community operated, to a
large extent, to render impossible the application of the power of
persecution to its full legal limits. Rich Catholics were quietly
tolerated, and generally received from the rich Protestants an amount
of respect and forbearance which the latter would not at any time
extend to their Protestant tenantry or workpeople.&#8221; <a href="#n5"
name="f5" id="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In 1763, a bill was even introduced &#8220;to give greater
facilities to Protestants wishing to borrow money from&#8221; Catholic money
lenders. Though this bill was defeated, Connolly suggested that its
mere &#8220;introduction serves to show how little the Penal Laws (against
Catholics) had operated to prevent the accumulation of wealth by the
Catholic propertied classes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Connolly&#8217;s historical thesis was, as R.M. Fox has indicated, &#8220;that
England was the exponent of the feudal-capitalist system in Ireland.&#8221;
The peculiarities in Irish history are not to be found only in the
modern period. They are to be found in Ireland&#8217;s long history, and most
especially during these seven centuries of English oppression. Let me
repeat, then, that Ireland under English rule reveals the cost, the
other side of progress. <a href="#n6" name="f6" id="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p>In this context, Connolly observed that one of the &#8220;Slave
birthmarks&#8221; in Ireland was &#8220;a belief in the capitalist system of
society: the Irishman frees himself from such a mark of slavery when he
realizes that truth that the capitalist system is the most foreign
thing in Ireland.&#8221; <a id="f7" href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p>In Ireland, then, the role of the Church was different from that
which it played on the continent. There it was bound up with the feudal
system and was a rich landowner in its own right. Involved in the
bourgeoisie&#8217;s attack on the feudal aristocracy was its attack on the
Church. The ideology of feudalism is penetrated through and through
with that of Catholic thinkers. Not only on the planes of politics and
economics, but also on that of ideology, the Church was attacked. In
France the desire of the peasantry for land and for freedom from many
remaining feudal restrictions over-weighed (in many parts of the
country) their loyalty to the Church.</p>

<p>Briefly, the Church was not bound up with the system of oppression
in Ireland as it was in feudal Europe. Even though Connolly did observe
that propertied Catholics in the eighteenth century did not suffer as
did the poor, it does remain true that they were discriminated against.
In addition, the alleviation of the operation of the Penal Laws, in the
case of the rich Catholics, was not a matter of law. The Irish were
penalized by the foreign invader and ruler because of their religion.
Catholicism and nationalism became bound together in the minds of many
Irishmen. The consciousness of individual Irishmen was not divisible
into compartments so that Catholicism would be fitted into one
compartment while hatred of an oppressor and desires for freedom would
be placed in another. To be Irish and to be Catholic were, in effect,
synonymous.</p>

<p>For an Irishman under these conditions to be free meant to escape
from penalization because of his religion as well as his nationality.
The logic of this attitude runs through the entire O&#8217;Connell movement
in the nineteenth century. In fact, Daniel O&#8217;Connell is often referred
to as the Great Emancipator. The victory of Catholic Emancipation in
1829 and 1830 was a signal step forward in the Irish struggle; and yet,
as Connolly observed and as is well known, it was achieved at a time of
marked miseries and destitution. Connolly, in fact, described the
period between 1830 and 1848 in Ireland as &#8220;<em>A Chapter of Horrors</em>.&#8221;
And he wrote about the tithes imposed on the peasantry by the clergy of
the Episcopal and Catholic Churches as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The fact that this was in conformity with the
practice of the Catholic Church in countries where it was dominant did
not, of course, make this more palatable to the Catholic peasantry of
Ireland, who continually saw a part of their crops seized upon and sold
to maintain a clergy whose ministrations they never attended and whose
religion they detested.&#8221; <a id="f8" href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">When the discontent of the peasants flared in rebellion,
&#8220;The Episcopalian clergymen called on the aid of the law, and, escorted
by police and military, seized the produce of the poor tenants and
carried them off to be sold at auction.&#8221; And what aid did the peasants
get during the period of rebellious struggles which were carried on
under the leadership of secret societies? Connolly&#8217;s answer to this
question reads as follows:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The politicians gave neither help nor countenance
to the fight, and save for the advocacy of one small Dublin newspaper,
conducted by a small but brilliant band of young Protestant writers, no
journal in all Ireland championed their cause. For the Catholic clergy
it is enough to say that while this tithe war was being waged they were
almost universally silent about that &#8216;grievous sin of secret
conspiracy&#8217; upon which they are usually so eloquent. We would not dare
say that they recognized that as the secret societies were doing their
work against a rival priesthood, it was better to be sparing in their
denunciations for the time being; perhaps this is not the explanation,
but at all events it is noteworthy that as soon as the tithe war was
won all the old stock invectives against every kind of
extra-constitutional action were immediately renewed.&#8221; <a id="f9"
href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">With Emancipation, the ground was cut from under
O&#8217;Connell&#8217;s feet. As O&#8217;Faolain, his biographer, says, he &#8220;could not
form a solid block of Irish votes, an Irish Party, immediately after
Emancipation, as Parnell did later.&#8221; The Emancipation Act was, in
reality, only a partial emancipation. And it only tended to open up
some eyes more clearly to the social question. The Young Irelanders of
&#8217;48 and James Fintan Lalor opposed O&#8217;Connell and O&#8217;Connellism.
Connolly, in <strong>Labour in Irish History</strong>, justifies their
criticism of and opposition to O&#8217;Connell. They, and Connolly later,
moved in the direction of social emancipation. They &#8211; and Connolly
after them &#8211; were advocates of extra-constitutional action, of
rebellion.</p>

<p>The foregoing should reveal that Catholicism is not a separate
question in Ireland. In fact, <em>religion is never a separate question</em>,
divorced from all of the political questions and struggles of a period.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Faolain quotes Balzac&#8217;s remark about Daniel O&#8217;Connell: &#8220;he
incarnated a whole people.&#8221; And then O&#8217;Faolain also pointed out how
O&#8217;Connell, a Tory, frightened by the French Revolution, became a
&#8220;Radical.&#8221; He goes on to say that O&#8217;Connell</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;toppled on the brink of Atheism. He recovered as a
Deist. He ended not quite as a Catholic, but as an Irish Catholic,
which among Irish intellectuals is so often little more than two words
for one. I doubt if there were more than one or two Irish patriots who
did not run a similar course in relation to religion &#8211; Tone, Emmet,
Lord Edward, Davis, Mitchel, Parnell, Stephens and most of the Fenians,
Collins, Clarke, Connolly, almost all wavering in a typically ambiguous
way barely stopping short on the edge of complete revolt from
orthodoxy.&#8221; <a id="f10" href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Rebellion in Ireland was not rebellion against
orthodoxy. It was national rebellion. In some instances it was purely
national, in others it was both national and social. In the case of
James Connolly, he was both nationalist and socialist.</p>

<p>Leftists have criticized him as a nationalist whose socialism was
either impure or else abandoned in his last days. Sean O&#8217;Casey&#8217;s first
writing was a pamphlet, <strong>The Irish Citizen Army</strong>, in
which he declared that Connolly died not for socialism but for
nationalism. To discuss Connolly in such terms is to become formal,
abstract; it results in the posing of formal questions which can only
lead us away from insight. The foregoing parts of this work have
offered more than sufficient evidence on the character of Connolly&#8217;s
socialist views. Abstract purists usually see the politics of a man as
though they were completely separated from that man just as they
fail to see Connolly&#8217;s nationalism as bound up with his socialism, so
do they see his socialism as in flagrant contradiction with his belief
in Catholicism. But his works, and the accounts of his life with which
I am familiar, would reveal no such glaring contradictions. Connolly as
much as O&#8217;Connell, or as much as any other Irish patriot or rebel, can
be called the incarnation of a people &#8211; to the degree that any one man
can be so characterized. His writings show to what degree the Irish
tradition was fused in his ideas. He studied this tradition and
evaluated it, made distinctions, and consciously made choices. At the
same time his emotions, his consciousness was molded out of the life of
Ireland. His personal religious beliefs were deeply felt and genuine.
To assume that he pretended to a belief he didn&#8217;t hold is really to
slander the memory of a great and honest man.</p>
