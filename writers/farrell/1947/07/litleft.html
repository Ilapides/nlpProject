<p class="fst">In the <strong>New Masses</strong> of April 9, 1946, Albert Maltz stated in
an article, <em>Moving Forward</em>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;In the Thirties, as there now seems to be general
agreement, left-wing criticism was not always conducted on the
deepest or most desirable or most useful level. Its effectiveness was
lowered by tendencies toward doctrinaire judgments and toward a
mechanical application of social criticism. And these tendencies <em>must</em>
be understood and analyzed if working class culture is to advance to
full flower. [Italics in original] But, on the other hand, the
inadequacies of criticism, such as they were, are only a small and
partial aspect of the left-wing cultural movement as a whole. The
full truth &#8211; as I have been aware of for many years &#8211; is this:
from the left-wing cultural movement in America, and from the left
wing internationally, has come the only major, healthy impetus to an
honest literature and art that these two decades have provided.
Compound the errors of left cultural thought as big as you will &#8211;
still its errors are small as compared to its useful contributions,
are tiny as compared to the giant liberating and constructive force
of Marxist ideas upon culture. As a matter of sheer fact this is such
a self-evident proposition that it doesn&#8217;t require someone of my
conviction to state it: it has been acknowledged even by reactionary
critics who, naturally, have gone on falsely to declare that the
liberating force of left culture has run its course and expired.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">At the suggestion of the editor of a well known quarterly
magazine, I wrote the following article. This magazine, however,
decided not to publish it for the alleged reason that it dealt too
much in personalities. After trying to publish it in one or two other
magazines and having it rejected, I put it away in my files. But in
the light of the fact that the Stalinists again are speaking in
&#8220;left&#8221; terms, and in the light of the fact that Albert Maltz and
many others in the <strong>New Masses</strong> and elsewhere are offering new
interpretations of what happened in Stalinist literary circles in the
1930s, I think it pertinent to publish this article now as a
contribution toward keeping the record clear, and in order to remind
the younger generation of writers and intellectuals of what really
happened in the 1930s. In this spirit, I publish the article.</p>

<p>Also, it is hardly necessary to add that the same spirit of
literary terror pervades the world-wide Stalinist movement at the
present time. One instance of it has been the cultural purge in
Russia in 1946. All over again, the leading cultural figures of
Russia were attacked and required to make confessions and to pen
public retractions. Among those forced to such indignity have been
Shostakovich (his &#8220;confession&#8221; appeared in the <strong>Saturday Review
of Literature</strong> of January 25, 1947) and Eisenstein. This would be
comic if it were not so grisly, so menacing.</p>

<h4>*</h4>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="fst">All is rather somnolent on the so-called proletarian literary
front. The official left is no longer so ambitious, energetic and
arrogant as it was in the first half of the 1930s. Then, the subject
of proletarian literature was frequently discussed and hotly debated
in the journals. The movement was consciously promoted by the
self-styled &#8220;Marxians,&#8221; who conceived themselves to be genuine
&#8220;scientific&#8221; critics, of literature; often they wrote with the
conceit of history. The novelists of the movement were producing a
rapid succession of books. A few of these works, such as Nelson
Algren&#8217;s <strong>Somebody in Boots</strong> and Henry Roth&#8217;s <strong>Call It
Sleep</strong> are of worth. But I believe that most of those novels were
over-praised, even log rolled, far beyond their merit. The critics of
the movement legislated what themes and subject matter a novel should
have. And when this legislation was more or less fulfilled in a novel
they praised it unduly. Then, if someone criticized the particular
work as bad, he would (in all likelihood) be taken over the coals by
Michael Gold, who was in the habit of making his own particular
conception of &#8220;loyalty&#8221; to the movement a primary basis of
literary appreciation. The growth of the left wing theater was also
celebrated; it was confidently predicted that the revolutionary drama
would drive Broadway to cover. The young left wing poets, just
beginning to lisp their numbers, were regarding themselves as the
leaders in a renaissance of American poetry. In brief, proletarian
literature, like <strong>Eclipse</strong>) was first, and the rest were nowhere.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Literary Left in Decline</h4>

<p class="fst">Today this entire movement seems bankrupt. Many of its exemplary
writers have long been rather silent. Some have obtained jobs in
Hollywood and elsewhere, and the more commercialized spheres of art
and journalism have attracted their energies. The little left-wing
magazines which sprouted all over the country, and which were
received as a sign of youth and growth-these are practically all
defunct. The Theater Union, after an abbreviated season in 1936, has
been disbanded. The Group Theater was temporarily disbanded. In 1937
it returned only briefly. However, the Group Theater can no longer be
considered a conscious part of the left-wing theater. For in 1936 its
board of directors published a statement in the <strong>New York Times</strong>
in which they definite1y separated themselves from the cultural left.
They declared that their aim was to produce good plays, irrespective
of social orientation. This was a denial of a fundamental conception
of the entire left-wing cultural movement. The magazine <strong>New
Theatre</strong> (which lived a short life as <strong>New Theatre and Film</strong>)
was the organ of the left-wing theater; it has been abandoned,
apparently for good. Many of the so-called proletarian novelists have
had no new books published in two or three years, and the reputations
made for them by critics like Granville Hicks are embalmed in the
dust of forgotten book reviews. Some of those works which have
appeared in the last two years are miserably mediocre. I refer to
such novels as Isidor Schneider&#8217;s <strong>The Kingdom of Necessity</strong>,
Clifton Cuthbert&#8217;s <strong>Another Such Victory</strong>, Edward Newhouse&#8217;s
<strong>This Is Your Day</strong>. In general, there are fewer cultural organs
of the official left, and those that remain grow increasingly dull
and sterile. Where there was once frenzied sectarianism, there is now
such roominess of acceptance that even commercial writers of no
literary consequence are admitted into the fold. And at the same time
political dogmatism and hysteria have intensified.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="fst">Alan Calmer, an editor of <strong>Proletarian Literature in the United
States</strong>, published an article in <strong>The Saturday Review of
Literature</strong> <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> under the title of
<em>Portrait of the Proletarian as Artist</em>. Mr. Calmer is not
politically opposed to the Communist Party. He is not, to use the
prevailing language of anathema and excommunication, a &#8220;Trotskyist.&#8221;
Therefore, not even an editor of the New Masses is likely to describe
his literary article as an attack on humanity by an ally of William
Randolph Hearst. In his article he attempts to explain the causes and
to trace the process behind the sudden disintegration of the official
left-wing cultural movement. He points out the contrast between the
old period and the present one: &#8220;In the old era, only Marx&#8217;s and
Lenin&#8217;s observations on art were free from criticism; now critics
who maintain that even nostalgic &#8216;feudal fiction belongs to us,&#8217;
are heralded as Marxists.&#8221; He illustrates how, with the change in
the party line, the old sectarianism was abandoned with unabashed
opportunism. He suggests that this shift is confusing to the young
proletarian writer. His article is an alarm signal, and in it he puts
his finger on one of the causes of the present state of
disintegration; it is &#8220;the subjection of literature to the tactics
of a political party.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Example of French Revolution</h4>

<p class="fst">Keeping this in mind, I believe that some historical exposition is
in order. Behind the widespread agitation for a proletarian
literature in this country there stands the Russian Revolution. It is
to be remembered that the effects of the great French Revolution were
international, and of a cultural and social as well as of a political
nature. In other countries, the French Revolution became a political
axis, and its influence reached into other fields of interest. French
influence spread over Europe. As one example of this, I might cite
the impetus given to American democratic sentiment by the French
Revolution, following our own Revolutionary War. This impetus
influenced the plays and the journalism of the period. One of its
manifestations was the spreading of a sentiment against aristocracy,
a sentiment expressed even by the growing American plutocracy that.
had been ushered into the tents of the mighty by the victory over
England. A parallel manifestation is observable in the case of the
Russian Revolution. Before the Russian Revolution, there was an
international Marxist movement. Marxism claims to be a world
philosophy, encompassing all phases of human activity. Consequently
it is historically normal that cultural struggles in Russia, the land
of the first Marxist revolution, should carry into other lands.</p>

<p>One of the cultural struggles in post revolutionary Russia
centered around the question of a proletarian culture and a
proletarian literature. The first years after November were years of
chaotic ferment. There were many schools in Russian literature, and
these all competed to gain literary hegemony. This was the period
when the best post-revolutionary Russian literature was produced,
with books like Isaac Babel&#8217;s <strong>Red Cavalry</strong> and Neweroff&#8217;s
<strong>City of Bread</strong>. The struggle reached even the topmost ranks of
the Communist Party, and a commission composed of Trotsky,
Lunarcharsky and Bukharin was formed to study the question and define
the party attitude on literary questions. The decision to permit an
anarchistic competition of groups and schools which accepted the
Revolution established an essentially &#8220;hands off&#8221; policy. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>
All groups which accepted the October Revolution were to be permitted
free scope. Such an attitude was essentially the one Lenin and
Trotsky took toward art; both of them inclined toward the &#8220;garden&#8221;
view of culture. Culture was for all. All were to be educated and
encouraged to partake of its fruits. Thus, Lenin once said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;We need the theater, not so much for propaganda as to
rest hard workers after their daily work ... We must preserve the
beautiful. ... There is nothing better than <em>A passionata</em> ...
The proletarian culture must appear as a natural development ...
Every artist, every-body who wishes to, can claim the right to create
freely according to his ideal.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Fight Against &#8220;Trotskyism&#8221;</h4>

<p class="fst">It was as a result of this ferment and struggle that Trotsky wrote
his book of literary essays, <strong>Literature and Revolution</strong>. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a>
In it he argued that there could not be a proletarian literature, for
the time elapsing between the November Revolution and the period of
the socialist classless society would be too brief in the historical
sense. The aim of the proletarian revolution was to create not a
class culture but a human and socialist culture. Trotsky also spoke
for art&#8217;s own laws and for the continuity of the creative
tradition. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> After Lenin&#8217;s death,
Trotsky was on the way out. Because of the political struggle between
the Left Opposition, which he led, and Stalin, Trotsky&#8217;s views on
literature and culture were attacked. The Stalinist literary group,
<em>At Your Post</em>, conducted the fight against Trotskyism, and it
was the central agent in forming the organization of Russian writers
known as RAPP, which advanced theses such as the following:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The rule of the proletariat is incompatible with the
domination of non-proletarian ideology and consequently
non-proletarian literature.&#8221; <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">And this:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The path which the proletariat has followed in the
field of politics and economics should also be followed in the field
of art &#8211; that is, the road to hegemony, the seizure of power by the
proletariat in the domain of literature.&#8221; <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Both the point of view and the pogrom methods of RAPP were
transported to this country.</p>

<p>Historically, then, it was to be expected that the international
effect of the Russian Revolution would be social and cultural as well
as political and ideological. It was to be expected that there would
be a reflection of Russian literary struggles in our own country. In
general, culture is now international rather than national, and the
effects of literary tendencies in one country carryover into other
countries. The particular effect of Russian literary struggles was a
consequence of Stalin&#8217;s victory and the fight against &#8220;Trotskyism&#8221;
which was carried on in all fields. In essence, this resulted in
complete subjection of literature to politics, the hitching of
literature to the party line. In this country the agitation for a
proletarian literature came most forcibly during the days of the
so-called &#8220;third period&#8221; of the Communist International. During
that period, the party line was based on the premise that an epoch of
capitalist stabilization in the West following the World War had
ended and that the proletariat of the advanced Western nations was on
the eve of seizing power. As a class, the bourgeoisie was losing its
grip. The workers of the world were preparing to overthrow their
masters and become the dominant class in modern society. If the
bourgeoisie was on the eve of losing state power, it was deduced, the
bourgeoisie was no longer capable of contributing to literature. For
bourgeois literature was without hope, defeatist, pessimistic,
despairing. Having a class orientation, it was dedicated to
emphasizing bourgeois values and defending the bourgeoisie against
the workers. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> If workers were
subjected to it, their revolutionary hope and optimism would be
corrupted. The time had arrived, then, to create a proletarian
literature, and the vanguard of the proletariat was the Communist
Party. Those who were not with the party were against it; they were
the class enemies of the proletariat. To this category belonged the
Socialists. They were the main adversaries because they were &#8220;social
fascists.&#8221; And in the field of literature, all liberal and radical
writers, all novelists working in the traditions of realism, and
naturalism in terms of the internal logic and development of literary
tendencies, were attacked, as were the Socialists in the political
arena. The conception of the role of the party was carried into
literature. Thus Edwin Seaver once stated:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The literary honeymoon is over, and I believe that the
time is fast approaching when we will no longer classify authors as
proletarian writer and fellow travelers, but as party writers and
non-party writers.&#8221; <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Joseph Freeman, in his introduction to <strong>Proletarian Literature
in the United States</strong> approved this statement.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Social and Political Motives</h4>

<p class="fst">It should be pointed out that in much of the agitation for a
proletarian literature, one simple distinction was almost never made.
It is the distinction between what might be termed s<em>ocial motives</em>
and <em>political motives</em> in literature. Many of our apologists
for a proletarian literature were not demanding <em>social motives</em>
only. <em>The were demanding a definite political motivation.</em> The
motives and intentions they demanded were not precisely the same as
those that went into the work of Dickens when he attacked prison
conditions in England. Nor were they precisely the same as those that
went into the composition of Zola&#8217;s masterpiece, <strong>Germinal</strong>.
Dickens attacked prison conditions and agitated for a change in them
because of their effect on human beings. Zola studied and observed
life in a mining community closely and attempted to describe that
life with the utmost precision. In both instances the authors wrote
in terms of own ways of seeing life, their their own temperaments,
the logic of their own literary developments. The apologists for a
proletarian literature not only demanded that the writer do as much
in terms of the present as did Dickens and Zola in their own epoch;
they called upon the novelist (whether they realized it or not) not
only to see life, but to see life as a corroboration of the
prognostications of the Comintern. They wanted the author to see the
party line working out in life, irrespective of what was actually
happening. Thus they would tell the writer what theme he should use
in his novels, what classes he should write about. The warrant
offered in justification of these demands was Marxism. They were
&#8220;dialectical materialists&#8221;; that is, true scientists. The truth
they spoke was scientific truth. They knew the laws of social
action and their speech embodied that law. They knew history and they
spoke in its name. To repeat, theirs was the conceit of history.</p>

<p>Writers often allowed themselves to become so badgered and upset
by this agitation that they tended to become dual intellectual
personalities. There was frequently a split between their literary
aims and their political affirmations. They had to apologize because
they failed to see the party line in the life they depicted, in the
literature they read and valued. Thus they would often say that they
liked such and such a book, that it was literature, but ... &#8220;it
isn&#8217;t our stuff.&#8221; Sometimes this agitation even went to the point
of castigation of literary forms. A leading figure of the movement
once called free verse a &#8220;fascist&#8221; form, and the young poets had
to waste time in the useless effort of disputing him.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&#8220;Party Line&#8221; Literature</h4>

<p class="fst">The basis of this criticism was almost always &#8220;ideological.&#8221;
The writer was often criticized because he wrote about the wrong
subject matter. The writer was told to be a Marxist, and to change
history with a lyric or a novel. He was told that in the present
epoch there was no time for the description of that incipiently
fascist class, the petty bourgeoisie. He must write of the manner in
which the workers were becoming class conscious. In other words, he
was told to describe the workers as they were described in the
prevailing party line. Methodologically, the fallacy here was what
Alfred North Whitehead has described as &#8220;the fallacy of misplaced
concretion.&#8221; An analysis of life is, by definition, an extraction
of elements from life. Mere analysis, that is, the party line, was
concretized and substituted for the raw, emergent movement of life&#8221;
itself. The psychology of human beings was deduced not directly from
experience but from a set of political theses. Philosophically, this
was backhanded idealism, the very tendency then being so violently
attacked by those who were thus themselves taking a side door into
idealism. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p>Social motives have been apparent in literature for a long
time-long, long before our recent agitation for a proletarian
literature. A continuation of such motives in terms of the internal
logic and development of literature &#8211; a continuation of the
creative literary tradition itself &#8211; was neither meant nor asked
for. Political motives were behind the demands of the &#8220;Marxians.&#8221;
They were not merely asking the writer to speak truthfully of social
problems, they were asking him to advertise the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Discussions of proletarian literature do not appear in journals as
frequently as they once did. There is a reason. The party line, upon
which the agitation for a proletarian literature was based, has been
changed. The present line postulates as the central issue of the
contemporary world the struggle between progressivism and reaction &#8211;
democracy <em>versus</em> fascism. The tactics based on this line call
for organization of all progressive forces in a popular front against
reaction. Applied to the cultural field, this means a front of all
anti-fascist intellectuals and writers. In many instances, the
writers to be won over to this front are the very ones who were so
stupidly attacked and so patronizingly insulted in the so-called
&#8220;third period.&#8221; It is obvious that such writers (with &#8220;bourgeois&#8221;
reputations) cannot be won over if the critics are to continue
attacking their work as they once did. The new line demands that the
old literary attitudes be sidetracked. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a></p>

<p>Anyone who has followed the <strong>New Masses</strong> literary section
from 1933 on will readily perceive that the old literary attitudes
have been sidetracked. The old fanaticism is gone. Writers who were
attacked are now praised, flattered, cajoled. The <strong>New Masses</strong>
motion-picture critics are constantly measuring Hollywood productions
in order to ascertain which are so many inches over toward the side
of progressivism. A Hollywood scenarist like Donald Ogden Stewart is
referred to as a man of genuine literary attainments and definite
importance in the history of American letters. Even Fannie Burst
receives serious consideration. Any writer who makes the least
gesture toward the official Left is now more than likely to receive
kindly treatment and free advertising from it when his books appear.</p>

<p>The new orientation demands tactics completely opposed to those
which were used in the so-called &#8220;third period,&#8221; and the new line
has effected an almost complete reversal of literary appreciations.
The case of Archibald MacLeish might be cited. In 1933 he was
excoriated and young left-wing poets were warned to beware of him.
When his poems, <strong>Frescoes for Mr. Rockefeller&#8217;s City</strong>,
appeared, Michael Gold in the <strong>New Republic</strong> castigated them as
possessing reactionary implications and revealing the &#8220;fascist
unconscious.&#8221; Now Mr. MacLeish&#8217;s alleged &#8220;fascist unconscious&#8221;
is forgotten. He &#8220;belongs to us.&#8221; He was a featured speaker at
the second American Writers&#8217; Congress. He makes no apology for that
&#8220;fascist unconscious&#8221; and his work is no longer attacked.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Intolerance Continues</h4>

<p class="fst">On the surface, it would seem that the new line makes for greater
liberalism and tolerance. It would appear that greater literary
freedom is now permitted and that the official Left is going to grow
up. But appearances are deceptive. The new orientation requires that
the old scapegoats be freed from literary pogroms, and that a new
group be found to take their place. This has happened. All writers
who declare themselves against war and fascism, who affirm faith in
democracy, who accept the official interpretations of the Soviet
Union, the Kremlin foreign policy, the new Soviet constitution, and
the Moscow Trials &#8211; they are left alone and are eligible for
admission into all revised categories of &#8220;honest&#8221; intellectuals.
They are working for the future of humanity. But whether or not their
literary work has integrity is not particularly important. If, for
instance, they work in Hollywood on an anti-labor film &#8211; well, they
can be excused. After all, they have no more control over the product
of their labor than has a Bethlehem steel puddler. But if, because
they oppose war and fascism and believe in human rights and freedom,
they express skepticism toward the Moscow Trials, that is another
matter. Then they are not &#8220;honest&#8221; intellectuals (revised
category). They are enemies of mankind. They have entered Mr.
Hearst&#8217;s valley of San Simeon. On the basis of such a line, the old
intolerance flourishes as ever. If anything, political dogmatism has
been intensified under the new line.</p>

<p>One reason why the new slogans have become an effective cover for
a continuation of intolerance is that a number of respectable writers
have more or less been won over as allies. They serve the function of
attractive bay windows. The official Left is tolerant of them. They
help out by occasionally making speeches, by occasionally writing in
the <strong>New Masses</strong>. They are allies to be exhibited in public.
Writers like Archibald MacLeish, Malcolm Cowley and Donald Ogden
Stewart fall into this category. They do not do the hatchet work. But
the hatchet work is done. And when it is, such &#8220;allies&#8221; make no
protest. It is all for the sake of humanity.</p>

<p>Proof of increased intolerance is to be found, for instance, in an
article contributed to the <strong>Daily Worker</strong> on October 20, 193?,
by V.J. Jerome, a party functionary who works in the cultural geld.
It is titled, <em>No Quarter to Trotskyists &#8211; Literary or Otherwise</em>.
I quote from this article at considerable length because it is most
revealing. Mr. Jerome writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;What are our forces doing on the literary front to
expose and drive out from our midst the Trotskyist imposters? What is
being done by our comrade writers to attend the warnings sounded by
Comrade Stalin in his great address on <em>Mastering Bolshevism</em>?
How should they work to hurl out of the way the Trotskyist obstacles
to promoting, through the powerful medium of the pen, the People&#8217;s
Front principles? What should they do to bring socialist achievements
of the Soviet Union closer to literary creators and audiences? ...</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;What strikes one at first glance is the too common
notion that the struggle against Trotskyism concerns the party and
trade unions but not writers; that the literary battle is a thing
apart from the political struggle; that the Farrells and the Lionel
Abels and the Rahvs may be Trotskyites [sic!] but as writers they
belong with us in one confraternity &#8211; a &#8216;united front,&#8217; you
might say. Otherwise, how shall we explain their inclusion in our
anthologies [???] and the prise of their &#8216;style&#8217; [???] in our
magazines? Not that this notion is prevalent everywhere in our
literary circles; but it does obtain in varying degrees and when
encountered is often met by a thoughtless conciliatory attitude.&#8221;
(It would appear that the &#8220;style&#8221; of <strong>Studs Lonigan</strong> is
threatening to become a Trotskyist menace to the working class front
&#8211; in fact, to the human race.)</p>

<p class="fst">Mr. Jerome goes on to criticize the <strong>New Masses</strong>. If a writer
is attacked there as &#8220;Trotskyist,&#8221; Mr. Jerome does not want the
editors to grant the common democratic and editorial courtesy of
allowing him to reply to such attacks. He says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;To admit the right of counterrevolutionaries to the
platform or press of the working class or the progressive movement on
the assumption of·· &#8216;tolerance&#8217; or &#8216;fair play&#8217; means to
accommodate the worst enemy which now confronts the forces of world
progress.&#8221; (This means that he wants all such writers barred from
contributing to organs like <strong>The Nation</strong> and <strong>New Republic</strong>.)</p>

<p class="fst">It should be pointed out here that the definition of a
&#8220;counter-revolutionary&#8221; changes with each change in the party
line. It is to be remembered that three years ago Mr. Jerome would
not have publicly criticized any statement of, say, Karl Radek, and
that he would have been very likely to have called
&#8220;counter-revolutionary&#8221; any American writer who challenged an
article of Radek&#8217;s. One gets dizzy keeping account of who is, and
who is not, a &#8220;counter-revolutionary.&#8221; Such an effort demands a
separate full-time study.</p>

<p>Mr. Jerome concludes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;It is time to recognize that Trotskyites, &#8216;literary&#8217;
or otherwise, are engaged in tearing down all that we are working to
build up, that the class struggle permits no rotten liberalism
towards our enemies, that the fight against fascism demands the
complete routing and annihilation [???] of Trotskyism. The writers of
the progressive camp &#8211; Communists, left-wingers and progressives
generally &#8211; with <strong>New Masses</strong> as the rallying voice, can play
an important role in the developing People&#8217;s Front by being
consistent in their anti-fascism, by being simultaneously loyal to
the principles of the People&#8217;s Front and ruthless with the enemy &#8211;
with fascism and Trotskyism.&#8221;<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&#8220;Trotskyists&#8221; to Be Barred</h4>

<p class="fst">The expressed purpose of the People&#8217;s Front is to defend
democracy. Two of our most precious democratic rights are free speech
and the right to be considered innocent until proved guilty. What
kind of loyalty is Mr. Jerome speaking of when he demands that the
<strong>New Masses</strong> and, also, progressive magazines deprive writers of
these rights whenever Mr. Jerome&#8217;s party calls them &#8220;Trotskyists&#8221;?
For Mr. Jones does not confine his meaning of &#8220;Trotskyist&#8221; to the
political followers of Leon Trotsky, who call for the Fourth
International, and who are organizationally connected with the
international Trotskyist movement. <em>He refers to all sorts of
writers who maintain their independence of judgment and arrive at
conclusions on political, intellectual or literary questions which
happen to differ from the prevailing views held on these questions
within the official Left movement. Here he reveals that his mind has
a totalitarian cast.</em> He lets the cat out of the bag. He talks of
democracy and uses new slogans to cover the naked face of intolerance.</p>

<p>This intolerance becomes clear if we remember what he has said of
&#8220;Trotskyites&#8221; and his call for their &#8220;annihilation&#8221; [?], and
then cite instances of &#8220;Trotskyism&#8221; mentioned in the official and
semi-official press. What are some of the crimes of &#8220;Trotskyism&#8221;?
One is that of unfavorably reviewing Robert Briffault&#8217;s novel
<strong>Europe in Limbo</strong>. The radical critic, Phillip Rahv, committed
this crime in <strong>The Nation</strong>. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a>
He concluded his review thus:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Mr. Briffault is interesting for his eccentric
disposition, which in its composite effect recalls to us such diverse
figures as H.L. Mencken, Benjamin De Casseres, Nietzsche, Dean Inge,
and William S. Hart with a smoking gun in each hand and tears in his eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Michael Gold exposed this &#8220;Trotskyist&#8221; crime in a <strong>Daily
Worker</strong> column entitled <em>A Literary Snake Sheds His Skin</em>.
<a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a> He called Mr. Rahv a &#8220;literary
snake,&#8221; and added that &#8220;there is something sneaky, too, about <strong>The
Nation</strong> in encouraging him.&#8221; Rahv, it seems has no right to
criticize this novel because Mr. Briffault is &#8220;a great
anthropologist who turned at fifty-five to novel writing, and did a
really original thing in making a bestseller out of the revolutionary
criticism of capitalism.&#8221; Michael Gold refuses to grant Rahv the
status of literary critic, declaring that Rahv attacks Briffault &#8220;not
as a Trotskyite, mind you, but as a literary critic.&#8221; It would
appear from the above that there is no end of damage being done to
contemporary American letters. &#8220;Trotskyism&#8221; in American letters,
according to the official Left, is becoming the same kind of devil
under everybody&#8217;s bed that Rousseauism was in the mind of the late
Dr. Irving Babbitt.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Hitler&#8217;s Tactics in Literature</h4>

<p class="fst">The moment one discusses the &#8220;official Left&#8221; in American
letters one is led into discussing almost everything but literature.
This very fact should make clear to the reader the degree of genuine
interest the &#8220;official Left&#8221; has in literature. Literature is
subjected to political expediency. It is part of a monolithic
political movement. It is dominated by totalitarian states of mind.
In one period, book reviews end with discussions of industrial
activity in the Soviet Union and condemnations of a &#8220;social fascist.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the next period a book review is likely to turn into an alleged
&#8220;Trotskyist&#8221; plot to break strikes. The &#8220;official Left,&#8221;
literary and otherwise, uses the same tactics that Hitler does. It
lumps all who disagree with it in the same category. This is a
familiar political trick. It has nothing whatever to do with literature.</p>

<p>The consequences of applying such tactics in literature should be
clear to those who read this article. When writers become absorbed
into the official Left, they unwittingly fall into line. The official
Left is primarily a <em>pressure group</em>. It uses culture and
literature as a means of advancing itself as a pressure group. The
writer who maintains his intellectual independence is bound to become
lost and sidetracked in its mazes, especially if he is a literary
critic. There is no place for the literary critic in such a political
movement. When he becomes part of it, he finds that maintenance of
his literary tastes constantly involves him in criticism of the books
of his &#8220;political&#8221; allies and comrades. If he is a novelist, he
finds himself running afoul of a party line laid down by an
infallible set of leaders. These leaders are all <em>dialectical
materialists</em> and are furnished with the key to all history.
Whatever they do becomes historic necessity. Their premises
concerning life are handed to the writer as life itself, and he is to
write books celebrating them. Furthermore, he will awaken one morning
and read in the <strong>New York Times</strong> that the party line has been
changed. He will suddenly discover his comrades applying the new
party line in literature, praising new literary allies. He will find
commercial writing and Hollywood, the foe of his every literary
ideal, now being given serious attention. It is apparent that there
can be no creative and intellectual continuity in such a literary
tendency. There can be no expansion of literary sensibilities. There
can be no development of those intellectual perspectives necessary to
fertilize a literary movement. In terms of literature, there is no
sanction for the cultural policies which the official Left has
successively implemented. If the official Left wishes to establish
political sanctions for its cultural policies, it must come forth and
do so by showing the co-relationships between literature and
politics. At the present time the only sanction offered in its
defense is its own infallibility. And it goes almost without saying
that creative writers do not fare well in infallible political
movements. If they allow themselves to be compromised by this
movement &#8211; as many contemporary American writers have &#8211; then the
future opening up for them is more likely to offer the roles of
demagogues, political hacks, and literary cops than those of poets,
novelists and literary critics.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f3" name="n3">3.</a> When Leon Trotsky&#8217;s <strong>Literature
and Revolution</strong> appeared in English, Michael Gold wrote of it in
<strong>New Masses</strong>: &#8220;America needs a <em>critic</em>.&#8221; While
disagreeing with Trotsky&#8217;s thesis concerning proletarian
literature, Gold wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Trotsky&#8217;s book on literature is an amazing
performance. This man is almost as universal as Leonardo da Vinci.
The Revolution shares with the Renaissance the fact that men have
again become versatile ... Trotsky was the most single-minded of
pacifists but made himself the best general and mil1tary tactician in
Europe. He is a great financial expert. He is now chief organizer of
the reconstructed Russian industry. He helps direct the diplomacy. He
reads and writes five or six languages, and knows the intimate
affairs of every country in the world. Occupying a group of positions
that would correspond to several cabinet offices in this country,
combined with the presidency of the steel trust, and rubber, oil and
textile industries, this man finds time to turn out at least two
important books a year, some of which serve as textbooks in economics
and history, besides scores of articles on industry, international
politics, the Einstein theory, finance, Freud, the American agrarian
situation. Chinese history, and labor movements, poetry, the atom,
the stage &#8211; every phase of intelligence that the Revolution must
use or understand ... Criticism like Trotsky&#8217;s is creative criticism.&#8221;</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f4" name="n4">4.</a> Trotsky&#8217;s thesis on literature is connected with his theory
of permanent revolution and a discussion of it involves political and
literary eschatology. Particularly in the light of the course of
history since it was written, this is not now the aspect of his book
most interesting for America. The value of the book in America now
would he twofold: the specific literary studies of Russian writers
and the attempt to found literary criticism on a materialistic and
naturalistic basis.</p>
