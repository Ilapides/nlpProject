<h3>I</h3>

<p class="fst">The aged Pope recently appeared before 400 exiled Spanish
refugees, spoke solicitously of the mystical Body of Christ and the
ills and sorrows of war-torn Spain, and called benignly for a
world-wide anti-red crusade in the spirit of Christian tolerance and
charity. It was a scene rich in irony, but the Catholic press was too
concerned with heralding the words of the Pontiff to catch the note
of irony. The Jesuit weekly <strong>America</strong> drew a touching contrast
between the Holy Father forgiving Communists who are raping Mother
Church in Spain, and Joseph Stalin brewing new vials of hatred in the
Kremlin. Stalin&#8217;s adherents make him out to be infallible; the
church attributes to him other characteristics of the early popes,
one of whom wrote in the eighth century: &#8220;Do not the Franks know
that all children of the Lombards are lepers? ... May they broil with
the devil and his angels in everlasting fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic church has been built and defended not only
with prayers and the will of the Almighty, but also by means of blood
and the sword. Neither the Holy Ghost nor Saint Peter ever
contributed as effectively to the defense of the papacy as did, say,
the Frankish King Pepin and his great son Charlemagne, who restored
the weak Pope Leo III by force of arms. Down through the ages the
Roman Catholic church has balanced prayers with the rack,
canonization with the might of the sword, the power of wealth and
oppression with appeals to the dreams and ignorance of the masses. It
has, by the variety of its instruments, weathered the storms of
centuries. Revolutions have come and gone, but Mother Church has
remained the pillar of Christendom. In Spain today she stands with
gun in hand defending churches which have been turned into arsenals.
Her priests lay down their weapons to grant absolution to those who
are about to be massacred by rebels wearing the badge of Mary on
their sleeve and by those great defenders of Christianity, order and
authority &#8211; Mohammedan Moors. And the Vicar of Christ gently
restrains them, forgives the &#8220;reds,&#8221; and tacitly gives his
benediction to the slaughter. The American Catholic press backs up
the rebels. Thus <strong>America</strong> recently commented: &#8220;With such an
enemy [communism] there can be no compromise; the Americans with
liberal ideals will join the Bishops of Pamplona and Vittoria in
calling down a blessing &#8216;on those who at the moment are sacrificing
themselves for religion and country&#8217;.&#8221; And when Michael Williams
rather mildly dissented from this kind of rabidness in a recent issue
of the liberal Catholic weekly, the <strong>Commonweal</strong>, a priest took
the trouble to write in to correct him.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Church Investments</h4>

<p class="fst">The Catholic church in America has never been more alert, more
militant. more on the offensive than it is at present. E. Boyd
Barrett, an ex-Jesuit, has written in the opening pages of his
excellent and well-documented book, <strong>Rome Stoops to Conquer</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;From an insignificant group of 25,000 adherents,
shepherded by thirty poor priests, in 1789, the Catholic church in
America has grown to be a congregation of 20,000,000 led by 30,000
priests. From being propertyless, she has become a rich institution,
whose wealth exceeds two billion dollars. From being a despised and
scattered flock, she has become the most perfectly organized body in
the world, enjoying immense influence and power.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">In an article in the <strong>American Spectator</strong> (January 1936)
entitled <em>The Finances of the Catholic Church</em>, Ferdinand
Lundberg furnished detailed and illuminating corroboration of
Barrett&#8217;s statements. Quoting from the New York State banking
records and &#8220;selecting items at random from the portfolio of the
church&#8217;s investments,&#8221; he presented a half-page list of the
corporations in which the church has invested its funds &#8211; Pure Oil,
Commonwealth Edison, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, Baltimore &amp;
Ohio, and so on. The list is a directory of the industrial United States.</p>

<p>Many commentators have mistakenly appraised religion in terms of
individual piety, the attendance records at church services, and the
like. They have failed to realize that religion is an institution and
that it must be studied in terms of its influence as such. Among
religious institutions the Roman Catholic church is the richest, the
most solidly organized, the most cohesive. The strength of its
organization gives it a position in our society which no other church
possesses and makes it potentially a threat to progressive forces,
despite the fact that piety in American life is on the decline, that
many individual Catholics disregard the church&#8217;s doctrines on birth
control, and that many of the enrolled twenty million Catholics do
not partake of the sacrament regularly. Also, its organization is
strictly authoritarian and anti-democratic.</p>

<p>These facts are interesting, particularly at a time when Mother
Church has again come forth as the Church militant, flying the banner
of Catholic action. The center of its offensive under the leadership
of the Pope is, and must be, America. America is the citadel of world
capitalism. Christendom is one of the spiritual bodyguards of world
capitalism. Protestant Christianity was, of course, a reflex of the
rise of world capitalism. It furnished the religious ethics which
served as part of the rationalized explanation of the aims and ideals
of the rising middle class. The connection between the rise of
capitalism and the Reformation is close. In due time Mother Church
swung into line. Part and parcel of medievalism, dependent for her
strength upon her land holdings in the Middle Ages, she shifted her
emphasis and adapted herself to the new capitalist world economy.
Today the church remains the rock of Christianity even though it does
not possess the sweeping power which it once held, even though a
Hitler does not come crawling to Canossa. It is only logical that
Roman Catholicism should seek to conquer in America. The death of
capitalism will be the death of Mother Church. She will then be
divorced from Caesar, and forced to practice her platitude of
rendering unto Caesar his due, and giving unto God His due. The
church will become a purely religious organization. Its power will be
founded on prayer, superstition, and its ability to sell the promised
joys of the kingdom of heaven. Its economic basis will be shattered.
And no institution whose economic base has crumbled can survive as a
social force.</p>

<p>Rome has lost other countries. It is now faced with the loss of
Spain. Whoever wins in Spain, the church will emerge with lessened
power. Fascism will reduce it to the position of a subsidiary ally.
In order to retain its position, it must conquer America to
compensate for its losses in other parts of the globe. Today a
considerable proportion of the income of the church comes from this
country. If the annual American contribution to Peter&#8217;s Pence were
subtracted from the income of the Vatican, that income would be
shrunken indeed.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Attitude Toward Fascism</h4>

<p class="fst">For financial and other reasons the Roman Catholic church does not
prefer fascism, despite its alliance with Mussolini. Monarchism,
Bonapartism or capitalistic democracy is better suited to its
intentions. Fascism is an expensive venture for the church, just as
it is for capitalism. Fascism is a desperate attempt on the part of
capitalism to save itself by hiring political Capones. These
gangsters must be paid. Capitalists have to fork over some of that
payment. If the church wants to survive, it also must contribute.
Before Mussolini signed a concordat with the Vatican, the Black
Shirts destroyed and outlawed Don Sturzo&#8217;s Catholic Party, and they
attacked the Catholic labor organizations as viciously as they
attacked the socialist trade unions. Even after the concordat,
official attacks upon Catholic Action brought forth a papal
encyclical in which the Pope complained of attacks on the youth of
Catholic Action and protested repeatedly that Catholic Action was
non-political. The experience of the Catholic church in fascist
Germany is similar. Thus the church repeats its own history. It
opposed the rise of capitalism and the bourgeoisie. It aligned itself
with the aristocracy in the period of the bourgeois revolutions, and
even down into the nineteenth century the papacy was anti-democratic.
We are now entering a period of new wars and revolutions. The defense
against revolution is fascism. If that defense is successful there
follows a new distribution of power, wealth and executive control, in
which Rome does not propose but must accept terms. In order to
survive, Rome must compromise and pay. For that reason the church
does not prefer fascism.</p>

<p>In America there is no strong likelihood of fascism in the
immediate future. American capitalism has not yet been forced to draw
upon its reserves. The American working class has not yet become a
direct revolutionary threat to capitalism. The American form of
government as an instrument of capitalist state power has not yet
broken down. Now is the strategic time for Rome to offset its losses
in Europe by gains in the United States &#8211; before fascism unleashes
all those vile and obnoxious anti-Catholic prejudices which are
smoldering in the Bible belt.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="fst">The instrument with which the church hopes to conquer America is
Catholic Action. The present Pope has defined it as follows:
&#8220;Catholic Action is nothing else than the apostolate of the laity
under the leadership of the bishops.&#8221; Michael Williams in <strong>The
Catholic Church in Action</strong> states that &#8220;primarily, Catholic
Action ... may be described as both the intensification and the more
highly organized collective direction of the apostolic mission of the
church to the world, built upon the &#8216;participation of the laity in
the apostolate of the hierarchy&#8217;.&#8221; E. Boyd Barrett defines it thus:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Catholic Action is best described as the new phase of
Catholicism ... In theory, Catholic Action is the work and service of
lay Catholics in the cause of religion, under the guidance of the
bishops. In practice it is the Catholic group fighting their way to
control America ... In medieval times the church gained supremacy in
various countries through her influence over nobles and soldiers.
Today she aims at the old supremacy by mass action of her organized
subjects and by systematic penetration of various groupings.</p>

<p class="fst">Barrett&#8217;s description of Catholic Action is a satisfactory one
if we apply two corrections. In his reference to medieval times he
neglects to indicate the economic basis of the church&#8217;s supremacy,
namely, its vast land holdings. Secondly, he speaks of the aim of the
Catholic church &#8211; to regain its quondam supremacy &#8211; as if this
aim were achievable in the present era. The church cannot turn back
the clock of history, the late Gilbert K. Chesterton and Hilaire
Belloc to the contrary notwithstanding. It can only defend itself by
becoming a staunch ally of capitalism, whether the latter takes the
form of bourgeois democracy or fascism.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Apparatus</h4>

<p class="fst">In America, then, Catholic Action is working systematically to
permeate the life of all Catholics. Christ instructed his apostles to
go forth and teach all nations. The Catholic laity is ostensibly
organized for a crusade to intensify Catholicism, to further the
spiritual and material aims of the church. For this purpose the
church has its Knights of Columbus, Holy Name societies, Catholic
alumni organizations, Catholic Youth Clubs, Newman clubs in the
universities, guilds for doctors, writers, actors, and nurses. It has
a powerful formal and informal apparatus of education, and it even
fights bitterly to force the appropriation of public funds for the
assistance of private &#8211; read Catholic &#8211; institutions. Through
such papers as the <strong>Catholic Worker</strong>, which offers saints and radical
phrases to the proletariat, it bids for stronger support from the
worker. Its journals now reflect plans for the conversion of the
Negro, whom it has long neglected, in order to neutralize his radical
and revolutionary potentialities. The church commands a fighting
press, manned by militant mediocrities of the type of Michaeldiv
Williams and Father Talbott, S.J. It has organized the Legion of
Decency with ten million members &#8211; and this organization is able to
dictate to supine producers in Hollywood what the American public,
including its millions of non-Catholics, shall see in motion-picture
theaters. It lobbies against child-labor laws on the theory that such
laws would give the state control over the child, who, according to
the will of God and natural law, belongs to the Deity, the parent,
and the parish priest. It attacks the dissemination of birth-control
information. In some of its organs, notably America, we occasionally
find expressions of anti-Semitism which might well have emanated from
Nazi Germany. Likewise the Catholic press conducts a consistent and
continuous red-baiting campaign, which is supplemented with speeches
by prominent Catholic laymen and clergymen. This theme dominated the
recent convention of the Holy Name Society in New York City. The
alumni of Notre Dame University are now planning to add bolshevik
hunts to college cheer-leading as an occupation for adults who have
never fully grown up. Meanwhile the church demands of President
Roosevelt that he interfere in the internal affairs of Mexico. In a
recent issue of <strong>America</strong> one Thomas S. Hunter writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The Mexican issue is not a Catholic issue, it is not a
politico-religious issue; it is a fundamental issue in which our own
essential liberties are involved. If freemen, irrespective of creed
and color, fail to respond to Rome&#8217;s appeal, Mexico will perish,
and we who have stood by impassive and watched her agony, will we escape?&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Here is an open call for intervention. But where was Rome&#8217;s
appeal to &#8220;freemen&#8221; to halt Mussolini&#8217;s invasion of Christian
Ethiopia? What effective policies did Rome introduce to achieve
liberty and social justice in Spain? What did the church ever do to
alleviate the abject poverty and complete illiteracy of the Mexican peons?</p>

<p>Since this is the formal role which Mother Church is playing and
seeking to play in America today, it is pertinent to summarize her
apologetics. I have already suggested the biblical justification of
Catholic Action, the command to the apostles to go forth and teach
all men and all nations. Further, the church contends that since the
disruption of the feudal and medieval era materialism has been
growing in the world. Today neopaganism has gained such a foothold
that it threatens civilization unless the spiritual forces of
Christendom, guided by the firm hand of the Pope and led by the
church, organize to stem the tide. Today the world suffers grievously
from the heresy of materialism, which generates a false science. This
causes class war, irreverence for authority and order, and
immorality. And further, materialism as a heresy has become organized
in the movement known as communism, which operates from Moscow, the
red Rome. Communism persecutes religion and gloats over the murder of
priests and nuns. It promotes atheism and class war; it threatens to
destroy liberty and disrupt the family. Coeval with its threat to the
family is its attack on private property. Private property is an
institution justified by natural law. Its defense was framed in the
writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Evil does not flow from the
institution of private property or from the profit system which is
constructed upon it, but is the result of the failure of those who
own private property to make the right use of it. Thus the solution
of the economic problems of the world is not socialism, which places
the ownership of the means of production in the hands of the
proletarian state. Rather, it lies in the employer&#8217;s acceptance of
a moral obligation to give his employees a just and fair wage.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Catholicism and Democracy</h4>

<p class="fst">In America the church now insists that it accepts democracy and
asserts that the Constitution of the United States must be defended.
And who is to be its defender? That 100 per cent American
institution, the Roman Catholic church, whose Pope lives in the
Vatican and is always Italian and whose College of Cardinals is also
preponderantly Italian. The entire structure of the church is
anti-democratic. Its theology is dogmatic. It permits no error, no
deviation in conduct, and it carries its dogmatic control to the
extent of maintaining a papal Index of Books. The church insists that
it accepts the principle of the separation of church and state. The
Dogma of Papal Infallibility, which was log-rolled into acceptance in
the last century over the arguments and protests of the more
intelligent Catholics, gives the Pope final authority on matters of
faith and morals, and it holds that on such matters the Pope cannot
err when he speaks <em>ex cathedra</em>. The only catch is the fact
that faith and morals manage to become intermingled with political
and economic questions. While the church professes belief in the
separation of church and state and in liberty of conscience, it
insidiously attempts to eat up the state and organize conscience
within the framework of an unrelenting set of dogmas. The democratic
pretensions of the church are a front and a heresy. They will be used
as long as they are needed, and when they become cumbersome, they
will be Jesuitically refined, refashioned, and placed on file in the
Vatican until they are again needed.</p>

<p>In its appeal to proletarians, many of whom are nominally or
actually its religious subjects, the church is beginning to assume
pseudo-radicalism. Up to now Father Coughlin has served well on this
front. His doctrines of social justice are indubitably modeled upon
the famous encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII and Pius XI. However, Father
Coughlin is an out-and-out, acknowledged fascist, and in his paper,
<strong>Social Justice</strong>, he is even now beginning to speak favorably of
the new Germany. A Catholic priest as a fascist leader in a
preponderantly Protestant country is too much for the Vatican. But
Father Coughlin has expressed the ideas and sentiments of the famous
&#8220;red paragraphs&#8221; of the encyclicals issued by the present
Pontiff. To quote Pius XI, &#8220;The immense number of propertyless
wage-earners on the one hand and the superabundant riches of the
fortunate few on the other are an unanswerable argument that earthly
goods so abundantly produced in this age of industrialism are far
from rightly distributed and equitably shared among various classes
of men.&#8221; Hence there is a need of social justice. The laborer must
be worthy of his hire. The rich must not abuse their gifts and goods.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Every effort must be made that at least in the future
a just share only of the fruits of production be permitted to
accumulate in the hands of the wealthy and that an ample sufficiency
be supplied to the workingman ... Entirely false is the principle
widely propagated today that the worth of labor and therefore the
equitable return to be made fur it should equal the worth of its net
result. Thus the right to the full product of his toil is claimed for
the wage-earner. How erroneous this is appears from what we have
written above concerning capital and labor.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">This last is obviously an attack on Marxism.</p>

<p>As Adam Smith has said, there is a lot of ruin in any system.
There remains a lot of ruin in American capitalism. There remains a
lot of ruin in world capitalism. The policy of the Catholic church is
to intrench itself in that ruin. In a world on fire the policy of the
church is to ally itself both with God and with those who have
economic power. The church must retain its income from America. And
it must remain on good terms with American capitalism. The Holy
System of Profits and the Holy Ghost are lining up side by side to
save what privileges they can in an era of worldwide decay.</p>
