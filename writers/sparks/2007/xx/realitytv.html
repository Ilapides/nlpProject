<p class="fst">A row over racist abuse on the January 2007 edition of <em>Celebrity
Big Brother</em> focused public attention in the UK on &#8216;reality
TV&#8217;. This round of public outrage is merely the latest in a long
series of disputes that have dogged <em>Big Brother</em> since the
first version was broadcast in the Netherlands in 1999.</p>

<p>Controversy over the show is not confined to racism. Figures from
across the spectrum of opinion have debated the morals of the
contestants, and the morality of watching them in situations usually
regarded as private and personal. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> In
fact, the very idea of the show initially struck its eventual British
promoter, Peter Bazalgette, as too shocking. Writing to the
programme&#8217;s Dutch inventor, John de Mol, he rejected the idea, arguing:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The rats-in-a-cage-who&#8217;ll-do-anything-for-money is
something that I doubt we could sell on to commercial television ...
as currently constituted, we feel the show has a narrow market in the
UK. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The storms over the show and the free publicity they generate in
the media are a big factor in its success or failure. The format of
locking people into a confined space together for several weeks is
more or less bound to generate conflict of one kind or another. There
are, however, much wider issues about the nature of cultural
experience in contemporary capitalism that are involved in this kind
of broadcasting. The various manifestations of <em>Big Brother</em>
are one version of the broader category of &#8216;reality TV&#8217; that has
a central place in contemporary television.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What is &#8216;reality TV&#8217; and why is there so much of it around?</h4>

<p class="fst">The kinds of programmes known as &#8216;reality TV&#8217; form a very
mixed bag. They include what are essentially game shows, such as <em>Big
Brother</em>, &#8216;docusoaps&#8217; such as <em>Airport</em> and &#8216;true
crime&#8217; shows such as <em>Crimewatch UK</em>. The popularity of such
programmes is located in the shifting economics of broadcasting,
which involves increasing competition and a move from the search for
a mass audience to a niche audience. Television began as a technology
that could only sustain a small number of channels. The imperative
was to try to attract the largest possible number of people to a
channel, and programme types such as the soap opera, the situation
comedy and the variety show were developed precisely to generate this
&#8216;mass&#8217; audience.</p>

<p>Few channels meant little competition for revenue. In the UK the
main commercial broadcasters, the consortium of companies making up
ITV, enjoyed a monopoly of the sale of television advertising on
terrestrial TV from its inception in 1955 right up to 1993. To the
extent that ITV faced competition from the BBC, it was for audiences,
not revenues. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> In the course of the
1970s and 1980s a combination of technical changes and shifts of
government policy started to undermine the mass audience. The
increasing penetration of cable and satellite delivery systems meant
that multichannel television became a reality, first in the US and
later in Europe. At the same time, particularly in Europe, neoliberal
ideology increasingly favoured competition and markets as against the
combination of political and cultural paternalism that had dominated
the main national broadcasting organisations.</p>

<p class="fst">Established broadcasters found themselves faced with a new
situation (see figure 1). On the one hand, they were, and are, still
the only people who can deliver anything approaching a mass audience:
ITV&#8217;s drop from 44 percent audience share in 1981 to 20 percent in
2006 may be a drastic decline on the past, but it is still ten times
as great as the most successful of the niche channels. On the other
hand, they no longer enjoyed a more or less captive audience &#8211; some
viewers spent more of their time watching channels that provided a
diet of programmes more exactly suited to their narrow range of
tastes. The mainstream broadcasters thus needed to develop programmes
that could both attract as much of the mass audience as possible and
find ways of holding on to hard to reach groups such as young people.</p>

<p>The traditional terrestrial channels responded to the new
challenges with a range of strategies. The first was very traditional
&#8211; they launched an attack on the conditions of the workers who
produce television programmes. One major mechanism for this was to
move from predominantly in-house production to subcontracting
production to independent companies. For many workers, this meant a
shift from permanent, full-time, and highly organised, employment to
a succession of short-term contracts under much worse conditions. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a>
Another was to try to find new programme types that could still
gather a mass audience but which were much less expensive than the
traditional formats. A third was to try to minimise the risks of
investing heavily in failure, for instance by making new programmes
that are quite like old programmes that were a hit or by reusing a
format that has succeeded in another broadcasting market. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a>
The fourth important mechanism was to try to commercialise programmes
more fully, for example by pushing associated merchandise such as
books and DVDs, and using the same material across different
platforms. A fifth was to try to develop programme types that
appealed to particularly desirable audience segments.</p>

<p>It was this combination of factors that led to the rise of the
wide variety of reality TV shows. Such shows are relatively cheap,
and some are very cheap indeed. There is no need to pay writers or
actors, no endless rehearsals, no need for elaborate sets, no need
for rights clearance for music, and so on. Using &#8216;ordinary&#8217;
people, and later minor and declining celebrities, is a cheap way to
make television:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Reality programming provides a cheap alternative to
drama. Typically, an hour-long drama can cost approximately $1.5m
(£875,000) per hour, whereas reality programmes can cost as little
as $200,000 (£114,000) per hour. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The flood of &#8216;documentary&#8217; films about passing a driving test,
working in the air transport industry, looking after animals, and the
flood of makeover programmes about houses, clothes and body shape,
all fit this economic dynamic exactly. <em>Big Brother</em> and
<em>Survivor</em>, which has fulfilled the same function in the US,
evolve out of these conditions. In many respects they displayed all
of the characteristics of the type, but they differ slightly from the
bog-standard reality show in some important respects. In neither the
UK nor the US were the broadcasters taking big risks. Both of the
programmes are based on formats that had been tested in other markets
but then modified to take account of the particularities of different
national audiences. <em>Big Brother</em> was originally shown in the
Netherlands and, despite Bazalgette&#8217;s worries, it proved a
successful formula. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a> It was taken up
widely as a proven crowd puller by broadcasters around the globe. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>
<p>These programmes also originated with independent production
companies, which meant the broadcasters did not have to bear the
development costs. This independent origin is, however, something of
a double-edged sword. The great success of the format has meant that
Endemol, the Netherlands company that originated <em>Big Brother</em>,
has been able to strike hard bargains with broadcasters wishing to
buy it.</p>

<p>This leads to one of the major differences between these shows and
the standard reality television product &#8211; they are relatively
expensive. Quite apart from the cost of purchasing the rights to such
a successful show, <em>Big Brother</em> has other large expenses.
Continuous surveillance of contestants requires a production team of
about &#8216;200 people ... including 50 cameramen [<em>sic</em>] and 13
producers&#8217;. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> <em>Celebrity Big
Brother</em> has the additional cost that, while the celebrities are
not exactly A-list, they still expect substantial fees. Shilpa Shetty
was allegedly paid somewhere between £200,000 and £300,000 simply
for appearing in the show. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a>
<em>Survivor</em>, which uses exotic locations and is produced up to
the standards of primetime US network TV, is also extremely costly
for a reality programme. The justification for this expense is that
these programmes deliver extremely valuable audiences, which in turn
earns broadcasters very large advertising fees. Hill writes of <em>Big Brother</em>:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>Big Brother</em> gave Channel 4 its most popular
ratings in the history of the UK channel, attracting nearly 10
million viewers in 2000; the second series of <em>Big Brother</em>
averaged 4.5 million viewers, giving Channel 4 more than a 70 per
cent increase on their average broadcast share. <em>Big Brother 3</em>
generated over 10 million text messages, and attracted 10 million
viewers for its finale. A 30 second advertising spot during <em>Big
Brother 3</em> cost £40,000, over three times more than for any
other show on Channel 4 in 2003 (for example, <em>Frasier</em>&#8217;s
cash value was £14,000 for a 30 second spot). <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Really real?</h4>

<p class="fst">The label &#8216;reality TV&#8217; begs the question, &#8216;How real is what
we see?&#8217; The answer, of course, is, &#8216;Not at all.&#8217; These
programmes make a strong claim to some form of &#8216;realism&#8217;. This is
sustained by the style in which such programmes are usually shot,
which clearly originated in the genre of observational documentary,
which does make strong claims to reveal reality. A further dimension
of &#8216;realism&#8217; is added by the fact that the contestants are
usually not professional actors and they are usually seen in
unscripted and mundane situations. In fact, these are rhetorical
rather than substantial features of such programmes; what we see is a
highly-constructed artefact rather than a slice of &#8216;real life&#8217;.</p>

<p>The process of manipulation begins long before the shooting
starts. The selection of contestants is the first hurdle. In
<em>Celebrity Big Brother</em>, and similar shows, there is no
pretence that the people are anything other than extraordinary.
Unlike their more plebeian fellows, they are well paifd for their
time. &#8216;Ordinary&#8217; contestants get a fee to cover expenses &#8211; for
these contestants, a major motive often seems to be a desire to
become a celebrity and to work in television. Certainly some people,
Jade Goody for example, have seen their lives transformed by success.
From the first UK series, winner Craig Phillips, runner-up Anna
Nolan, and villain &#8216;Nasty&#8217; Nick Bateman have all had reasonably
successful careers in the media. This is not an invariable outcome,
however. Nichola Holt, also from the first series, had some initial
media success but eventually landed in much less glamorous circumstances.</p>

<p>The participants in the non-celebrity shows are presented to us as
a cross-section of &#8216;ordinary&#8217; people reflecting contemporary
British society, or at least its younger, European members. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a>
In fact, the people we get to see are the product of an elaborate
process of selection in which the producers choose a group that they
hope will produce good television. As Bazalgette puts it, &#8216;There
are three crucial factors in the production of <em>Big Brother</em>:
casting, casting and casting.&#8217; <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p>For the earlier series, the process began with a flood (usually
more than 100,000 each time) of expressions of interest, and the
filling in of an elaborate form. Motivated individuals who survived
that sent in two-minute videotapes. There were about 5,000 for the
second series, 9,166 for the third, and 10,012 for the fourth. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a>
The process of selection for the 2007 show, which closed in February,
was rather simpler, which may reflect reduced public interest. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a>
As the selection proceeds, candidates are interviewed, by a
psychotherapist among other people. Eventually, a small number of
participants and reserves are chosen. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p>At least for the earlier series, the producers denied casting for
open conflict, and specifically they denied they cast for explicit
racial or sexual conflict. The psychotherapist for the first series
argued that it would be counter-productive to &#8216;throw in people who
would obviously disagree, like putting a racist and black guy
together ... we know opposites like that would have a big fight and
then stop communicating, and in the house they had to keep
communicating for a long time&#8217;. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a>
What they are certainly looking for are characters who can be
expected to develop complex relationships and thus ongoing dramas.
The producers are also prepared to manipulate the contestants to
achieve this, rather than simply relying on events to take their
natural course. The contrived nature of the environment, with many of
the determinants (e.g. work) and distractions (e.g. television) that
characterise our everyday lives removed, acts strongly to prioritise
personal interactions based upon taste and interest. This probability
is intensified through the interventions of the disembodied Big
Brother himself and the tasks set for the participants.</p>

<p>In order to achieve dramatic narratives, the producers ruthlessly
edit the raw footage. For example, in the first Australian series
182,750 hours of material were edited down to 70 hours of television.
<a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a> An extreme &#8216;observational&#8217;
documentarist like Roger Graef might have a shooting ratio of 30 to
one, and a drama perhaps three to one; the Australian <em>Big Brother</em>
figures work out at 1,565 to one. Even the &#8216;live&#8217; show broadcast
continuously (first on the web and then on E4 in the UK) is not an
unmediated account of reality but an edited selection of shots (there
are no &#8216;action&#8217; shots from the camera in the toilet, thankfully).
More importantly, it is not live: there is a built-in delay of ten
minutes to allow for editorial intervention in the case of unsuitable
material, for example, brand advertising, swearing, defamatory
material and &#8216;inappropriate behaviour&#8217;. This resource is used.
Bazalgette records an incident involving Jade Goody from her first
appearance which provoked a long debate among the production team and
heavy censorship in the great British tradition of prudery. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a>
More recently, police investigations into charges of racism have
focused on tapes allegedly containing more offensive material that
were not broadcast.</p>

<p>Just as much as anything else on television, <em>Big Brother</em>
is constructed to attract and hold an audience which will, in a
commercial context, be sold to the highest bidder. It uses &#8216;real&#8217;
people in certain kinds of &#8216;real&#8217; situations, but it chooses and
manipulates them in order to produce narrative, drama and conflict.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The evolution of the form</h4>

<p class="fst">Not all series of <em>Big Brother</em> have been equally
successful. The indications are that the first three series played to
average audiences that increased from 4.6 million to 5.9 million.
<a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a> Between versions three and four,
however, Channel 4 issued advice on &#8216;how not to get into <em>Big
Brother</em>&#8217;, the prospective contestants&#8217; tapes contained less
extreme behaviour, and the casting appears to have been designed to
provoke less dramatic conflicts. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a>
The series was rewarded with a slump in ratings to 4.9 million and
the producers thought again. What they thought was that they needed
to make the show more sensational in order to recover the audience,
and both casting and editorial interventions became more extreme.
This reversed the decline in ratings, but in order to maintain
interest there has been an obligation to ratchet up the eccentricity
of the cast of characters and the unpleasantness of the tasks they
must perform. As the Creative Director of <em>Big Brother</em>
argued, &#8216;The levels of intervention from us increase as the show
progresses &#8211; we have to find creative ways of making the experience
different&#8217;. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a> In pursuit of this
objective, the &#8216;character&#8217; of <em>Big Brother</em> has changed
over the years, becoming crueller and more demanding. The BBC
reported at the start of the 2006 series, &#8216;<em>Big Brother</em>
will be &#8220;more twisted than ever&#8221; this year, according to the
Channel 4 reality show&#8217;s producers&#8217;. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p>The British production team continue to reject the frequent charge
that they are casting specifically for sexual encounters, although
they recognise that there is likely to be at least some of the
latter. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a> As Bazalgette put it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Put twelve young people in a confined space for a length
of time and there will be both sexual tensions and releases. But to
succeed <em>Big Brother</em> needs relationships to develop. Sex is
incidental &#8211; <em>Big Brother</em> remained popular in the US,
Australia and the UK for several series without any instances of
sexual intercourse. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Some conflict, and some crises, and some romances are valuable
elements in developing the kind of narrative that &#8216;good television&#8217;
requires in order to attract a large audience, but these elements
must appear to us to arise out of the dynamics of the household.</p>

<p>The development of the form, however, has changed those dynamics.
In reality, the show has moved away from its always tenuous claims on
&#8216;reality&#8217; and more towards performance. The casting and the
situations are more and more contrived to allow the participants to
display themselves in situations ranging from the undignified to the
grotesque. In this, the standard <em>Big Brother</em> has converged
more and more closely with <em>Celebrity Big Brother</em>, where the
casting of entertainment professionals always meant that a high
degree of performance would be central to the show. Jade Goody, who
was the star, if not the winner, of the standard series she
participated in (<em>Big Brother&nbsp;3</em> back in
2002) exemplifies this shift towards the self-conscious performance
for the cameras.</p>

<p>The producers of the recent series of <em>Celebrity Big Brother</em>
might not have known and agreed in advance that the mix of
personalities they chose was going to result in racist bullying and
abuse, but they certainly knew that it contained all of the elements<p>
of a first rate row and this would be very good for ratings. Good for
ratings is good for business: Endemol&#8217;s share price rose sharply
after the recent row. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Who watches this stuff, and what sense do they make of it?</h4>

<p class="fst">All of the series of <em>Big Brother</em>, even the &#8216;boring&#8217;
fourth series, and all of the celebrity versions as well, have played
to audiences that are quite substantial for contemporary British
television. They are not the highest rated programmes: as figure 2
demonstrates, those spots are held, week in week out, by the
primetime soaps. To compare the <em>Big Brother</em> audience with
that of the soaps, however, is slightly misleading. While the soaps
air early in the evening, <em>Big Brother</em> is broadcast much
later, when the available audience is smaller. In its late evening
slot, <em>Big Brother</em> often has the largest audience share. As
is also clear from figure 2, the audience builds through the week and
peaks around the weekend evictions. Usually it rises over the run of
the series, too, but this standard pattern was interrupted in the
case of the most recent <em>Celebrity Big Brother</em>. The racist
abuse, and the furore surrounding it, more or less rescued an ailing
show. Its audience leapt, peaked with the eviction of Jade Goody on
19 January, and continued at a somewhat higher level for the final
week of the show. The calculation of conflict that had inspired the
casting produced the expected rewards in terms of audiences.</p>

</table>

<p class="fst">The crude figures, substantial though they are for Channel 4,
conceal a very important distinguishing feature of the audience.
Reality TV in general attracts audiences from across the social
spectrum, and <em>Big</em> Brother&#8217;s numbers, at around 25 percent
of the total audience, are less impressive than those of
&#8216;observational&#8217; shows such as <em>Airport</em> (67 percent), but
it attracts a unique and valuable audience. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a>
The hardest audiences to get watching television are younger people.
They have so many other things in their life, in contrast with those
with families or living in retirement, that they spend much less time
in front of the TV. On the other hand, they are a particularly
attractive audience to advertisers because they have larger
disposable incomes. Young men, in particular, have advertisers
queuing up for their attention. As figure 3 demonstrates, <em>Big
Brother</em> is very good at attracting a young audience. It is true
that the audience is disproportionately female, but it still contains
a large number of those attractive and elusive young male viewers.
<em>Big Brother</em> also captures a relatively affluent audience.
<a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a> What is more, the people who watch
the programme tend to be highly educated: 51 percent of students
claimed to be regular watchers, for example. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This audience has few illusions about what it is watching. When
asked to comment on the &#8216;reality&#8217; of different television
programmes, regular viewers rated <em>Big Brother</em> as much less
likely to be giving an honest picture of the world than other
&#8216;factual&#8217; forms such as news and wildlife documentaries. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a>
Audience responses demonstrate a sophisticated approach to what they
are seeing that has been honed over long periods:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The fact that audiences apply a sliding scale of
factuality to reality programmes suggests one of the ways they have
learned to live with this genre over the past decade. Audiences watch
popular factual television with a critical eye, judging the degree of
factuality in each reality format based on their experience of other
types of factual programming. In this sense, viewers are evaluators
of the reality genre, and of factual programming as a whole. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a></p>

<p class="fst">When asked, viewers respond that they think that the situation has
elements of reality in that it uses non-actors and has no script, but
they are well aware that they are watching something that has been
contrived by the producers to make entertaining television. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a>
Far from confusing the behaviour on the screen with the ways in which
people &#8216;really&#8217; behave, they are very conscious of the extent to
which they are watching performances and this is in fact one of the
main elements in what they think about the programmes. Like soap
operas, which make their own, rather different, claims to be pictures
of reality, one of the appeals of this kind of programme is that it
provides topics for conversation and reflection in which people
speculate about the dilemmas facing the characters, relate them to
their own experiences and values, and use them to reach moral
judgements about human behaviour. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a>
In this case, though, there is a specific element that is not present
in the soap opera. Audiences put great stress on trying to
discriminate between the &#8216;performance&#8217; that the participants give
and what they are &#8216;really like&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Reality gameshows have capitalised on this tension
between appearance and reality by ensuring that viewers have to judge
for themselves which of the contestants are being genuine. In fact,
audiences enjoy debating the appearance and reality of ordinary
people in reality gameshows. The potential for gossip, opinion and
conjecture is far greater when watching reality gameshows because
this hybrid format openly asks viewers to decide not just who wins or
loses, but who is true or false in the documentary/game environment.
<a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The tendency, at least in the earlier <em>Big Brother</em> shows,
was for the winners to be drawn from the participants who were seen
to be most genuine and most honest. The specifically unpleasant
characters tended to be despised, marginalised, and voted out.</p>
<p>The evolution of the reality gameshow that we traced above in the
case of <em>Big Brother</em> has produced a shift in the nature of
the kinds of talk and judgement that audiences make. The triumph of
nice people hardly made for the sort of compelling television that
the producers were trying to provide and as the characters have
become much more eccentric so the ways in which they are judged have
changed. There is now a much clearer sense that the people who take
part in what is sometimes called by audiences &#8216;humiliation TV&#8217;
are willing participants in their own exploitation and degradation.
They are thought to be decreasingly &#8216;real&#8217; and driven much more
by an unbridled, and unbalanced, ambition. As one respondent, a 30
year old male gardener, told Hill:</p>

<p class="quoteb">When I saw a bit of <em>Big Brother</em> recently, I
didn&#8217;t realise they were so, kind of, they are wannabes. I thought
they were genuinely just people plucked out of nowhere. They all,
like, wanted to be a presenter ... Reality TV is, they&#8217;re more like
sort of caged animals. And they&#8217;re agreeing to be degraded. Whereas
in documentaries, I think, there is a tradition of respect and
humanism in documentary making. There should be. People who want to
make documentaries are different types of persons to people who&#8217;d
get involved in reality TV. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The participants in the &#8216;ordinary&#8217; versions of <em>Big Brother</em>
are today seen in much the same light as the minor celebrities of the
celebrity version. They are treated as people who are &#8216;extraordinary&#8217;
in a negative sense and regarded as not deserving of the kinds of
care, respect and fairness that television should extend to the
really ordinary people who are seen in the news and in social
documentaries. People still watch <em>Big Brother</em>, but today
they are slightly ashamed of the pleasures they derive from it.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Critical responses</h4>

<p class="fst">Reality TV in general, and <em>Big Brother</em> in particular, has
generated an enormous amount of critical commentary. Much of this
material is frankly moralistic, seeking to condemn everyone involved
&#8211; producers, broadcasters, participants and audiences &#8211; as
engaged in a debased form of discourse in the &#8216;bread and circuses&#8217;
mode of public distraction. Alongside this there is a small library
of more substantial analysis from academics, some of which address
important issues like surveillance. The installation of video cameras
capturing every moment of life in the <em>Big Brother</em> house has
obvious parallels with the spread of CCTV through the public spaces
of the contemporary world. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a> Another
major issue of concern for academic analysis is the political
implications of the fact that <em>Big Brother</em> commands a large,
enthusiastic and largely young audience who pay to vote in
considerable numbers. There are serious analyses claiming that shows
like this can provide a model for the regeneration of bourgeois
politics. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a></p>

<p>From a Marxist perspective these issues, while interesting, miss
the point about what kind of social relations are embodied in the
show and what that helps us understand about the nature of
contemporary capitalism. Producers and broadcasters are engaged in
producing a marketable commodity, but to get the attention of the
audience (and so sell it to the advertisers) they have to produce
something that resonates with their intended audience and they have
to recruit suitable participants. The central question then is, what
kinds of motivations does the show offer to participants to take part
and to audiences to tune in and to vote in such numbers?</p>

<p>In its origins, reality television contained a strong current that
celebrated the labour of workers &#8211; at Angel tube station and the
London Zoo, for example &#8211; and other examples of virulent class
hatred directed at the rich (<em>The Fishing Party</em>). Even much
more entertainment driven programmes such as <em>Airport</em>
consisted in large measure of following working class people as they
solved difficult and unusual problems. Work, in these programmes, is
seen as a central part of human experience, and one that constantly
challenges the capacity of workers, although there was seldom any
explicit reference to the capacity of workers to challenge their
conditions of labour. Programmes such as <em>Big Brother</em>
represent a radical departure from that model in that they are
designed to cut the participants off precisely from the exigencies of
the world of work, and in that they represent a different account of
life under capitalism. They inhabit the world of leisure, consumption
and reproduction rather than that of labour, and one major attraction
of the show is that it takes us into that world. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a>
It is the way in which it shifts of the boundary of what can be made
public to include many things that are normally thought of as private
that has provoked most of the outrage about the programme.</p>

<p>The explanation for the attraction of this move is to be found in
the central features of human experience in developed capitalism. For
most people, most of the time, work constitutes a realm of unfreedom.
Not only can hours be long and wages low, but work involves following
orders that are imposed from outside, and producing commodities over
which one has no control. All of one&#8217;s creativity and individuality
is subordinated to the commands of the employer and devoted not to
the satisfaction of human needs but to the generation of surplus
value. The analysis of this reality is an important part of Marx&#8217;s
critique of capitalist production from the <strong>Economic and
Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844</strong> through to the pages of <strong>Capital</strong>,
and the basic ideas were generalised to society as a whole in the
first part of a famous essay by George Lukács: <em>Reification and
the Consciousness of the Proletariat</em>. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a>
The human being entering the workplace not only surrenders the fruits
of their labour, but also their control over their labour itself.
<a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a> As contemporary capitalism has
developed, and productive labour has come less and less to rely on
&#8216;hands&#8217; and more and more on &#8216;brains&#8217;, so the demands of
alienated labour have become ever more onerous. The conformity
demanded by the contemporary labour process includes much more than
simply clocking in on time and doing what the foreman says &#8211; today
you must abandon your individuality as well as your overcoat at the door.</p>

<p>There are two possible strategies in response to these realities.
One is the confrontation with alienated labour, whose highest form is
revolutionary struggle. As we all know, this is not an everyday
activity for the mass of the population. The other is to try to
discover some area of life which is not thoroughly permeated with the
logic of alienation. In contemporary society that takes the form of a
stress upon personal life and consumption. As Marx put it, &#8216;The
worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work
feels outside himself. He feels at home when he is not working, and
when he is working he does not feel at home&#8217;. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a>
It is only here &#8211; in what we wear, the car we drive, the music we
like, the relationships we form &#8211; that we can try to believe that
we are truly and fully individuals pursuing ends determined by our
own needs and desires.</p>

<p>There are, however, in capitalist society a tiny layer of people
who for a variety of reasons are not anonymous and interchangeable.
and whose personality counts for something. Some of them, such as
footballers and film stars, are richly rewarded for their special
attributes. Others have less tangible claims to distinction. But
however they come to hold this status they are clearly visible in all
their individuality, relationships and conspicuous consumption in the
pages of <strong>Hello!</strong> and <strong>OK</strong>. The realm of celebrity is the
realm of legitimised personality. One of the key characteristics of
celebrities is that their private lives and doings are taken to be
interesting and treated as public property. This is often denounced
as an intolerable intrusion, but in fact it is the highest reward
that can be bestowed under capitalism. Unlike the mass of the
population, the celebrity is someone whose individuality is taken
seriously. The idea of an individual magical escape into the world of
celebrity is an attractive one if the alternative of collective
action to achieve radical social change seems remote.</p>

<p>The evidence is that the people who participated in the first
series of <em>Big Brother</em> did not anticipate how this could be a
life-changing experience, but the potential was clear to those who
tried to enter later. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a> The would-be
contestants knew that for some at least success in the house could
lead to a different life, richer for sure but, just as important, a
life as a celebrity. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a> This is very
clear in accounts of the selection process. By the time the British
third series was recruiting, it was reported that a definite theme
emerged in the tapes sent in for audition:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There was a great deal of nudity:
people on the sofa nude, playing football nude, running down the
street nude, one man naked except for an accordion in field full of
cows, a naked girl smearing mud on her body, lots of women with
tassels on their breasts doing stripping routines, a man jumping
about on a pogo stick without his clothes. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a></p>

<p class="fst">By taking their clothes off in front of a camera, potential
participants were doing more than just signifying that they were
ready to go along with what they imagined the producers might be
planning. They were signifying their willingness to undertake the
role of celebrity and make their most private attributes public. As
the series has veered towards more eccentric participants, so
contestants&#8217; willingness to be public becomes clearer and clearer.
<a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a> Being on the show guarantees at
least a short period of time when one can be a celebrity, and for
some such as Jade Goody it actually provides the path to a longer
stint in that role.</p>

<p>The intense desire to be recognised, to be a celebrity, to become
a <em>Big Brother</em> contestant, is not primarily about the money
that comes with success, although that is surely something that is in
the front of people&#8217;s minds. Rather it is the desire to escape the
drudgery of anonymous, alienated toil in which one counts for
nothing. It is the desire to be recognised as somebody unique and
distinctive by a wider circle than one&#8217;s immediate family and
friends. The dream of celebrity is more than a magical escape from
the constraints of relative poverty and the drudgery of routine
labour. It is also, and most importantly, a magical attempt to
transcend alienated labour, not by expropriating the expropriators
but by evading the reality of being <em>only</em> the repository of
labour power.</p>

<p>For the audience, too, the attraction of <em>Big Brother</em> is
that it provides a site on which it is possible to discuss openly and
without social discomfort the fascinations of the personal. The fact
that what is normally private and guarded is displayed, indeed
flaunted, in front of millions of us, not with the distancing
conventions of drama but with the rhetoric of authenticity, provides
a powerful stimulus to discussion and reflection about personal life
in the modern age. It also provides an arena in which moral
judgements about behaviour can be explored. The audience, as one of
the production team put it, are &#8216;very moral. They reward good
behaviour and punish bad behaviour&#8217;. <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a>
One of the fascinations of the process is that it allows us to make
celebrities out of people we believe have acted well and to punish
those, like Jade Goody, who transgress what we believe should be the
boundaries of proper behaviour. The people who win in <em>Big Brother</em>
are the people the audience think deserve to become celebrities.</p>

<p>As we saw, these judgements depend on a balance between the &#8216;real
person&#8217; and their performance. The instability of the form, what is
often called its &#8216;feral&#8217; character, threatens this moral economy
even as the producers are driven to extremes in order to sustain
ratings. The shift towards more eccentric performers is not in itself
a threat: after all an eccentric is merely a personality who does not
fit into recognised social patterns and thus is very often a
challenge to the smooth running of capitalism. However, the
combination of eccentricity and humiliation detaches the performers
from any universe with which the audience can identify, and this is a
threat. It can still give pleasure to millions, but it is a different
pleasure. As the audience recognises, it is shifting from an arena of
moral exploration to a gladiatorial contest. Like the latter, it is a
compelling spectacle, but it gives a guilty pleasure.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>In conclusion</h4>

<p class="fst">Reality TV in all its versions, but particularly in its reality
gameshow format, represents, from the producers&#8217; and broadcasters&#8217;
side, an attempt to respond to the changing economics of contemporary
television. It is relatively cheap to make and it reliably garners an
audience in the right numbers and with the right composition to sell
to advertisers. <em>Big Brother</em> and some other similar game
shows are firmly within this category, although they have additional
elements that make them distinct both in their audience and in their appeal.</p>

<p>The fact that <em>Big Brother</em> gains such a large and
enthusiastic audience of young people tells us something about life
in modern capitalism. We cannot assume, as do so many populist
commentators in media and cultural studies, that just because lots of
working class people enjoy a particular artefact it is therefore in
some sense progressive or oppositional. The reality is much more
complex. A show such as <em>Big Brother</em> offers no challenge at
all to capitalism, and indeed its structure reproduces some of the
most pernicious effects of capitalism &#8211; human energy and initiative
are ruthlessly exploited in order to make money. On the other hand,
it does represent, in a weird and utterly unrealistic way, a dream of
escaping from capitalism, of transcending alienated labour, escaping
from conformity and flowering as an individual. Being a contestant
makes you a celebrity for the duration, and you have a fighting
chance of continuing in the role afterwards.</p>

<p>The fact that this dream of a better and fuller life is embodied
in a game show rather than a political organisation is a sad but
characteristic reflection of contemporary reality. When there is no
obvious alternative that can provide a focus for mass discontent, all
sorts of more or less magical solutions to the anger and frustration
that mar millions of lives are seized almost in despair. The chances
of winning on the National Lottery are tiny, but millions still buy
tickets. The chances of becoming a <em>Big Brother</em> contestant
are much bigger. Of those who become contestants, a celebrity career
is a small possibility, but thousands are still prepared to try to
make it.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f36" name="n36">36.</a> One line of thought is that the
<em>Big Brother</em> version of surveillance differs radically from
the classical Benthamite model prison, in which the few guards
observe the many prisoners, because the television version reverses
those proportions and the audience of many watch the few
participants. This, it is suggested, leads to a rudimentary form of
subversion of, or even resistance to, the pervasiveness of
surveillance in the outside world &#8211; John McGrath, <strong>Loving <em>Big
Brother</em></strong> (London 2004), p.&nbsp;206. A more orthodox line of
reasoning is that a show like <em>Big Brother</em> &#8216;validates the
pervasive surveillance of the rhythm of day to day life as a
contemporary commonplace &#8211; a form of convenience and entertainment&#8217;

of detailed exposure participants in the house experience would give
a better insight into political choices than do current forms of
publicity. More extreme claims are made for the impact of audience
participation in non-democratic societies. The voting in the Chinese
