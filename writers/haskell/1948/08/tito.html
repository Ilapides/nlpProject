<p class="fst"><strong>Tito&#8217;s Imperial Communism</strong><br/>
by R.H. Markham<br/>
<em>Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1947, 292&nbsp;pp.</em></p>

<p class="fst">This book on the Stalinist conquest of power in Yugoslavia is as
much a patriotic propaganda tract for American capitalism as an
analysis of Stalinism in the Balkans.</p>

<p>R.H. Markham has lived in the Balkans for more than thirty years &#8211;
first as a Protestant missionary, for the most part as correspondent
for the <strong>Christian Science Monitor</strong>. His knowledge of the culture and
politics of this region is perhaps unequalled among American
correspondents. Unfortunately, however, his bitter hatred for and
abysmal ignorance of Marxism leads him into such confusion in his
analysis of Stalinism that what he has to say loses much of its
potential value.</p>

<p>Markham&#8217;s description of how the Stalinists gained and held
power fits into the well-worn pattern of events in Stalin&#8217;s
satellite states of Eastern Europe. A totalitarian Stalinist clique
gains power by means of terrorism via typical GPU methods. All
opponents of the clique are either murdered or discredited as
&#8220;fascists.&#8221; A &#8220;popular front&#8221; government is formed by means
of splitting all non-Stalinist parties and accepting only the
completely subservient factions led by subservient leaders into the
ruling &#8220;coalition.&#8221; Industry is nationalized (90 per cent) under
complete control of the new bureaucracy. The whole nation is
&#8220;organized&#8221; into police-controlled bodies on the Russian pattern.</p>

<p>Markham does not much concern himself with describing specific
economic and social measures introduced by the Stalinist regime. He
confines himself mainly to proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that
all controlling positions in the political, economic and social life
of the country are held by Communist Party members, backed by the
ubiquitous secret police, and that all opposition is ruthlessly
crushed. He insists repeatedly that the regime is not supported by
any but the smallest minority of workers, peasants and intellectuals.
He does not even discuss whether or not the population at large, or
certain select sections of it, are better or worse off from the
material point of view.</p>

<p>Of special interest may be Markham&#8217;s description of how the
American and British governments were led to throw their support to
Tito and withdraw it from Mikhailovich during the war; of the way in
which the Yalta agreement was circumvented by Tito, etc. Also, for
those unfamiliar with this subject, Markham gives a good description
of the adherence to Stalinist ranks (and the elevation to high
office) of notorious fascist and reactionary leaders and supporters.
These include notably: Franz Piertz, former head of Milan Neditch&#8217;s,
air force; Marko Mesitch, who led a Ustachi band to the gates of
Stalingrad as part of Hitler&#8217;s army; Sulejman Filipovitch, who
headed one of the most ferocious Ustachi bands in exterminating the
Serbian population of Croatia. Similarly he gives a good description
of the typical Stalinist build-up of the hero-cult, aided by writers,
poets and artists who had distinguished themselves for sycophantic
adulation of every previous ruler of Yugoslavia.</p>
