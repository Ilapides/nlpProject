<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>, 19 March 2005.<br />
Transcribed by Christian H&#248;gsbjerg.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new" class="mia">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">There is a growing fear that US policies in the Middle East are stoking up sectarian tensions in Lebanon, and threatening a return to civil war. These fears have drawn people into the streets to protest against US interference in the country.</p>

<p>On Tuesday 8 March up to one million people, almost a third of the country, demonstrated against US demands that Syrian troops leave the country and the resistance organisation Hizbollah be disarmed.</p>

<p>It was one of the biggest demonstrations Lebanon had ever seen. But this was not the demonstration splashed across the world&#8217;s media on 14 March, and applauded by Bush and Blair.</p>

<p>On 8 March people held placards with a simple slogan &#8211; &#8220;No to US interference in Lebanon.&#8221; The march was called after weeks of the so called &#8220;cedar revolution&#8221; &#8211; anti-Syrian protests backed by right wing parties and blessed by George Bush and Tony Blair.</p>

<p>George Bush, who hailed the anti-Syrian protests as a new &#8220;tide of democracy spreading over the Middle East&#8221;, was silenced by the scale of the march.</p>

<p>One of the 8 March protesters was Maher, 25, from the mixed Ras al-Naba quarter of Beirut.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I agree that Syrian troops should leave the country, but I don&#8217;t want them to be replaced by US troops. Let us not forget what the Americans are doing in Iraq.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;Why should I trust the UN? The same organisation hasn&#8217;t stopped Israeli aggression in south Lebanon, nor have they implemented UN resolutions over Palestine.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Many of the people who marched fear that Israel and the US are trying to exploit tensions in the country.</p>

<p>Maher says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;The Israelis are the biggest terrorists in the region. I want Syrian troops to leave the country, but I don&#8217;t want there to be a racist war against the Syrians, the Palestinians, or other Lebanese communities. I don&#8217;t agree with everything Hizbollah says, but I feel I need to have my voice heard.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Despite the unity against US plans for the region, there are many who feel that neither the &#8220;opposition&#8221;, which is backed by the US, nor the &#8220;loyalists&#8221; who support Syria, have answers to Lebanon&#8217;s problems.</p>

<p>There is also a great fear that the country could be splitting along sectarian lines.</p>

<p>Some people protested against the assassination of former prime minister Rafiq Hariri and the presence of Syrian troops. Then they joined the Hizbollah-backed demonstration because they are also opposed to US plans for the region.</p>

<p>Nader, a 22 year old student from the Arab University in Beirut, at first joined the opposition demonstration, but found himself disagreeing with the aims of the &#8220;cedar revolution&#8221;.</p>

<p>He says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;I went to the demo, but when I tried to discuss issues I disagreed with, like US interference, sectarianism and the neo-liberal policies implemented by Hariri&#8217;s government, I was accused of being a &#8216;loyalist&#8217; and a member of the mukhabarat [secret police].</p>

<p class="quote">&#8220;So I joined the demonstration called by Hizbollah.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Growing anger at government policies are also fuelling general discontent. Last April the Syrian-backed government, with Hariri as prime minister, gunned down five metal workers during a protest against rising fuel prices.</p>

<p>Over the last ten years both the loyalists and the opposition have implemented harsh neo-liberal policies that have pushed thousands into poverty.</p>

<p>Last Sunday the Lebanese Communist Party and other left wing groups drew over 3,000 people to a meeting to protest at the rising sectarianism in the country. The left has called for a full withdrawal of Syrian troops and a rejection of US interference.</p>
