<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>, 21 June 2011.<br />
Transcribed by Christian H&#248;gsbjerg.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new" class="mia">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">It is six months since the wave of revolts started sweeping through the Middle East and north Africa. And the wave is far from over.</p>

<p>New political formations are taking shape across the region.</p>

<p>In Egypt, the growth of broad socialist groupings, and the formation of the Democratic Workers Party, clearly shows the shift to the left and class politics.</p>

<p>In Tunisia we witnessed the birth of the 14 January coalition between radical left forces, trade unions and others.</p>

<p>In Yemen, Syria and Libya the movement still has momentum, and it is getting increasingly organised.</p>

<p>Last week Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad promised reforms to tackle corruption and an amnesty for protesters.</p>

<p>This is a desperate attempt to demobilise the movement against his regime &#8211; Assad&#8217;s &#8220;reforms&#8221; would only take place if the protests stop. But it has had little impact on those taking to the streets.</p>

<p>In Lebanon, discussions on how to bring down the sectarian regime have spread across the country for the first time in decades.</p>

<p>The widening political rift between the Arab masses and the ruling elite is now spreading widely across the region. New battle lines are taking shape.</p>

<p>Now the Arab masses are taking up the question of opposition to religious sectarianism.</p>

<p>The ruling elite have increasingly used sectarianism in attempts to discredit and crush the movement. We can see this in Bahrain, Syria and Egypt.</p>

<p>Armed sectarian clashes also broke out last week between different groups in north Lebanon.</p>

<p>Religious sectarianism poses a real threat to the movement.</p>

<p>It can transform revolutionary struggles into bloody wars that crush working class unity and reinforce a new state of fear.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4>Leverage</h4>

<p class="fst">Sectarianism is an attempt to create the illusion that the welfare of one religious group lies in its ability to wage war and have economic and political leverage over another.</p>

<p>Yet these benefits are restricted to the ruling classes, while the working class and the unemployed become fuel for such wars.</p>

<p>It tries to create unity between rulers and workers from the same sect. This can only be challenged through class unity.</p>

<p>The Iraq war played an important part in preparing the ground for heightened sectarian politics in the region.</p>

<p>Sectarianism became the scarecrow used by regimes to scare off the popular movements.</p>

<p>This was obvious with Gaddafi, Assad, Mubarak and others. The equation for them was &#8220;either me or civil war&#8221;, using the example of Iraq to illustrate the horrors of sectarian warfare.</p>

<p>Imperialism has tried to use this to its benefit. The US government&#8217;s position on democracy has been completely discredited by recent events.</p>

<p>It is desperately trying to ally itself with the forces most ready to preserve US interests in the region, under the guise of wanting stability and reforms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the masses call for the regimes to be brought down.</p>

<p>Moreover, the US and Israel know that the real threat from these movements is wider democracy in the region.</p>

<p>They know that the Arab masses resent Zionism. The Israeli state is panicking as the regimes it has supported with the Americans come under threat.</p>

<p>The Arab revolutionary left has a historic opportunity to build. Revolutionary movements have achieved in days what reformists have promised for decades, but never delivered.</p>

<p>The Arab Revolution has only just started.</p>

<p>The region, which was for decades described as a political desert, is now a buzzing arena of debate and struggle for economic and political rights, democracy, equality, freedom and national dignity.</p>

<p>It showed what the Arab masses are really made of. Claims that Arabs are inherently sectarian, oppressive towards women and unable to live under democracy are quickly fading.</p>

<p>The real obstacles to change are shown up as the Arab dictatorships and imperialism.</p>

<p>This reminds us of a slogan used against the war on Iraq and Arab collaboration with imperialism: No war, no dictatorships!</p>
