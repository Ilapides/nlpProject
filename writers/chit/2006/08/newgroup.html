<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>, 19 August 2006.<br />
Transcribed by Christian H&#248;gsbjerg.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new" class="mia">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">Politically things are moving very fast. It&#8217;s already clear that we have a historic chance to build a new workers&#8217; movement that transcends sectarian divisions out of the rubble of Lebanon.</p>

<p>The relief effort was a real test for Lebanese society.</p>

<p>The fact that people came together from across the different sects to deliver relief shows that on some level we have got rid of sectarianism as a social problem. But we need to drive this much deeper.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of anger at the Lebanese government and I don&#8217;t think the government will last long. People feel that it was covering up for the Israeli aggression while the resistance was winning the fights on the ground.</p>

<p>It took the government of Fouad Siniora a whole week to come out against aggression. This is because a section of them hate their own people &#8211; to a degree, they wanted the population to be punished in order to win a political argument against the resistance.</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s an argument they have now lost. The Hariri gang, the Lebanese Forces and other pro-US forces behind last year&#8217;s so called &#8220;cedar revolution&#8221; have been defeated. The next phase of politics will be led by Hizbollah and Michael Aoun&#8217;s Free Patriotic Movement.</p>

<p>Now we need a grassroots movement that can fight for social justice and democracy across the Middle East. Much of the traditional left here has not grasped that Israel&#8217;s defeat is not just a win within Lebanon, but a defeat for the very idea of imperialism, and a defeat for the Arab regimes supported by imperialism.</p>

<p>The key task for the international left as a whole is to look at this question of imperialism, how to fight it and how to build movements that can organise internationally against imperialism &#8211; and not just in emergency situations.</p>
