<p class="fst">They say everything evolves around the idea of death,<br />
we all aim for death,<br />
we all know one thing is certain<br />
but as I draw these ideas into my head, I find no meaning<br />
if death is the only persisting truth<br />
then why is it only recognized through life<br />
why is it so essential to live if we all long for death<br />
in every minute of our lives, in every thought, word and sentence<br />
we are only pushing death away<br />
do we actually need to recognize death,<br />
is it that important to be thinking of an end<br />
 that we have no way of knowing when it happens<br />
emptiness is another word for silence<br />
death is another word for sanctuary<br />
we have created a world that is horrible enough<br />
to push us to believe in death as the only purpose<br />
is death the problem or is it us<br />
is life depressing, or do we make it of such<br />
we draw our own history letter by letter, point by point<br />
we create our ends and we create our beginnings<br />
we can lit the lights or we can put them down<br />
we decide our paths in every decision in every word and in every look<br />
it is time we look into life in the purpose of making something out of it<br />
it is time to stop looking at our ends, and look for new beginnings<br />
we have endured so much pessimism.<br />
take a deep breath and hit the road, it is time for change<br />
it is our time to write our own history<br />
we are no pones inside the course of life, we are life,<br />
 and without us life has no mere existence.</p>
