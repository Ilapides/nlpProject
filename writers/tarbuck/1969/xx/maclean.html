<p class="fst"><strong>Condemned from the Dock:<br />
John Maclean&#8217;s Speech to the Court in 1918</strong> <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The reprinting of this speech is a step that is very welcome at the present time. John Maclean has long been a neglected figure in British working-class history; both the Labour Party and the Communist Party, each for their own reasons, have tended to bury his memory. However, it is well that workers should be reminded what red-blooded Marxist leaders are like. Having suffered over the last few decades from a surfeit of boneless wonders, Maclean&#8217;s words come as a breath of fresh air: &#8216;I am not here as the accused; I am here as the accuser of capitalism, dripping with blood from head to foot.&#8217; Little wonder that Lenin was happy to have such a man as the first Soviet Consul in Britain. As Nan Milton says in the <em>Foreword</em>: &#8216;His speech ... was a vivid exposition of international socialism, and should be preserved as a part of the socialist tradition.&#8217;</p>

<p>I certainly recommend this pamphlet as a &#8216;good buy&#8217;.</p>
