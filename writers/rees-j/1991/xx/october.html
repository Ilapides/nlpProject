<p class="fst">Will those socialists who most fervently wished for the end of
Stalinism also be its last victims? The East European revolutions of
1989 were welcomed by most socialists, particularly those who argued
that Stalinism was not the rightful heir of the 1917 October
revolution but its perverter and destroyer. Nevertheless, the impact
of 1989 has not been to strengthen the general socialist tradition.
The very opposite has been the case.</p>

<p>The collapse of the Stalinist regimes has given renewed force to
an old argument: that the seeds of destruction were sown in the very
first days of the Bolshevik revolution. Predictably, right wingers
have seized on the &#8216;collapse of socialism&#8217; as a stick with which
to beat the revolutionary tradition &#8211; from former <strong>Times</strong>
editor William Rees-Mogg&#8217;s bizarre invocation of chaos theory to
show that Lenin&#8217;s struggle to gain control of <strong>Iskra</strong> in 1903
led directly to the gulag, to former US National Security Council
member Richard Pipes&#8217;s widely praised and intensely ideological
tome <strong>The Russian Revolution</strong>, the message is the same: Lenin
led to Stalin. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></p>

<p>In Russia itself a similar but even more profound ideological
shift is under way. Once both the Stalinist bureaucracy and the
Western ruling classes insisted that Stalinism was socialism. The
Stalinists needed the mantle of the revolution to justify their
barbarity and the Western capitalists needed to show that revolution
could only lead to barbarity. Then they united in arguing that the
revolution led to disaster. The Stalinist bureaucracy needed the
world market and the Western ruling classes wanted a Russia that was
open to the world market. In all cases and at all times these two
massive social forces united to exclude the voice of the genuine
socialist tradition, the voice which rejected both Stalinism and
Western capitalism.</p>

<p>So, just as Pipes was celebrating the White Russian interpretation
of the revolution in the West, <strong>Moscow News</strong> devoted its middle
pages to accounts of the revolution and civil war taken from archives
compiled by Josif Gessen of the Cadets, the bourgeois party in 1917,
including pieces written by the mother of White general Baron Wrangel
and by Tsarist officers. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> Meanwhile at
the Central Committee printing plant in Moscow in 1992 volumes of
Marx and Lenin gave way to biographies of Wrangel, his fellow White
leader Admiral Kolchak and Solzhenitsyn&#8217;s <strong>The Gulag Archipelago</strong>.
<a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> It is hardly surprising then that
socialists in Russia are confronted again and again with arguments
which first saw the light of day in White publications from the
1920s, like S.P. Melgounov&#8217;s <strong>The Red Terror in Russia</strong>. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>
<p>But what is new in the wake of the East European revolutions is
that many on the left have joined this already substantial chorus.
Immediately after the East European revolutions <strong>Marxism Today</strong>
editor Martin Jacques said, &#8216;It&#8217;s the end of the road for
Stalinism and most of Leninism. The people have rejected
authoritarianism.&#8217; Nina Temple, the general secretary of the
Communist Party, added, &#8216;If you look at Russia since the
revolution, things went wrong from the start&#8217;. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a>
Historian Eric Hobsbawm believes that, &#8216;For about half a century,
from 1914 to the aftermath of the Second World War, the world passed
through a period of cataclysm, producing all manner of freak results,
of which the Russian Revolution is probably the most long-lasting.&#8217;
Hobsbawm argues that Lenin shouldn&#8217;t have made the October revolution:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There were indeed Marxists &#8211; the Mensheviks, Plekhanov,
other people &#8211; even in Russia who took this view. Old Plekhanov,
who was the father of Russian Marxism, suggested to Lenin that all
you could produce that way was some kind of socialist version of the
Chinese empire. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In <strong>Has Socialism Failed?</strong> and other recent writings Joe
Slovo, general secretary of the South African Communist Party, added
his criticisms of the October revolution to the general hubbub, using
them as a lever to propel the South African CP along the reformist
road that its European sister organisations travelled long ago. In
<strong>The African Communist</strong> Slovo wrote, &#8216;Quite a few outstanding
leaders of the Bolshevik revolution (including Trotsky, Bukharin,
Kamenev and Radek) who came to be &#8220;oppositionists&#8221; to Stalinism,
not only played a significant role in erecting part of its
theoretical edifice, but also encouraged some of its practices before
Stalin was in the saddle and long before the emergence of an
economically privileged strata&#8217;. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a>
Thus Slovo, who spent every hour of his political career defending
Stalinism, accused Trotsky of being responsible for ... Stalinism!
Rarely can a blacker pot have upbraided a cleaner kettle.</p>

<p>With the Stalinists the umbilical cord that links socialists with
the struggle of the working class has been severed for so long that
it is unlikely that many of them will find their way back towards the
classical Marxist tradition. State worship, the craven bending of the
knee before the established fact of a strong state which called
itself socialist, was always an important part of Stalinism. Little
surprise, then, that once those states collapsed so too did the
Stalinists&#8217; faith in socialism.</p>

<p>More surprising than the reaction of yesterday&#8217;s Stalinists is
that of the anti-Stalinist socialists who have written about the
October revolution in a similar vein. Robin Blackburn, the editor of
<strong>New Left Review</strong>, has written that &#8216;Marxism cannot escape
implication in the fate of the Russian Revolution&#8217;. Lenin cannot
&#8216;escape the charge&#8217; of having laid the ground for Stalin, in part
because Lenin was not, mind you, &#8216;a systematic thinker&#8217;. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a>
And one time Marxist Paul Hirst has written that Lenin&#8217;s
determination to found a better society was a Utopian vision which
inevitably led to &#8216;the Bolshevik Party&#8217;s monopoly of power, to
the system of secret police control and to the inherently
authoritarian practice of democratic centralism&#8217;. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p>In <strong>Before Stalinism</strong> US socialist Sam Farber argues that
Lenin&#8217;s views and actions &#8216;<em>inevitably and necessarily</em> led
to an elitist form of government&#8217; and that the &#8216;Bolsheviks firmly
adopted policies that moved them a considerable distance towards what
later became the Stalinist totalitarian model&#8217;. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a>
Farber is a member of the US socialist organisation Solidarity and an
editor of its magazine <strong>Against the Current</strong> in which a fierce
debate over these and related issues has broken out. At least one
contribution is virtually indistinguishable from right wing attitudes
to the October revolution. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a></p>

<p>The same sort of argument has surfaced among oppositionists in
Eastern Europe. Adam Michnik criticised &#8216;the &#8220;totalitarian
temptation&#8221; of those activists in Polish Solidarity who wanted the
movement to ... struggle for state power&#8217;. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a>
And Moscow socialist Boris Kagarlitsky, in an account generally more
sympathetic than many in the West, still claims that &#8216;Lenin&#8217;s
party was to a greater degree the party of Peter I than the party of
Karl Marx, since it strove first and foremost to ensure that Russia
imitated contemporary forms of Western organisation&#8217;. He goes on to
argue that the Bolsheviks&#8217; &#8216;dictatorial methods scared off the
Western proletariat from revolution&#8217;. The fact that &#8216;the
Bolsheviks did not take into account the indivisibility of democratic
principles&#8217; was one element in making the rise of Stalin the &#8216;more
or less logical&#8217; result. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></p>

<p>There is clearly a case for revolutionaries to answer. Such an
answer must move beyond the general accusation that &#8216;Lenin led to
Stalin&#8217; and examine in detail the arguments of the Bolsheviks&#8217;
critics. This involves looking at some of the key questions about the
Russian Revolution: Was it a &#8216;premature&#8217; revolution? Was the
October revolution a coup? Were the Bolsheviks a monolithic party?
Were the Bolsheviks right to disperse the Constituent Assembly? What
about the Red Terror, the Cheka and Kronstadt?</p>

<p>Such questions are of more than historical interest. The October
revolution is the touchstone of 20th century politics. To know an
individual&#8217;s attitude to October is to know whether they stand for
capitalism, Stalinism or the genuine socialism of the classical
Marxist tradition. As Stalinism collapses the question is posed point
blank: is &#8216;reformed&#8217; capitalism now the only path the working
class can take? To those, like Martin Jacques, who can see only the
precursor of Stalinism in the October revolution, the answer is an
enthusiastic yes. Those who rot on the dole queues of the Western
world, those threatened by slump and war, racism and oppression may
not be so quick to agree. They may wish to know why today many
socialists rush to join in declaring that Lenin led to Stalin with
those who are in every other respect their bitterest enemies.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>A &#8216;premature&#8217; revolution?</h4>

<p class="fst">It has once again become fashionable to appeal to the Mensheviks
and to Kautsky and Plekhanov, to show that the Russian revolution was
&#8216;premature&#8217;, that the economic conditions in backward Russia
could not support the attempt to build a socialist society. This is
the gist of Hobsbawm and Kagarlitsky&#8217;s comments cited above. It is
also an important part of Robin Blackburn&#8217;s case:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In <strong>The Communist Manifesto</strong> and in other writings, Marx and
Engels famously insisted that a genuine socialism could only be built
on the basis already laid by capitalism; in <strong>The German Ideology</strong>
they observed that socialism would require social overturns in at
least several of the most developed countries. From this classic
Marxist conviction it followed that it was a complete delusion to
attempt to &#8216;build socialism&#8217; in one large and backward country.
<a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This argument is, of course, the ABC of Marxism. Its logic is
faultless so long as it is confined to the borders of one country.
But already in 1906, in <strong>Results and Prospects</strong>, Trotsky had
dealt with this objection in detail. He examined the maturity of
Western industry and the Western working class in the section on &#8216;The
prerequisites for socialism&#8217; and then went on to address precisely
the question that Robin Blackburn, using Kautsky as his authority,
raises. Trotsky&#8217;s conclusion was:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>Without the direct state support of the European
proletariat the working class of Russia cannot remain in power and
convert its temporary domination into a lasting socialistic
dictatorship</em>. Of this there cannot for one moment be any doubt.
But on the other hand there cannot be any doubt that a socialist
revolution in the West will enable us to directly convert the
temporary domination of the working class into a socialist
dictatorship. <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the course of 1917 Lenin and the Bolsheviks adopted this
perspective wholeheartedly. Even Stalin could summarise the
differences between Lenin, on the one hand, and Zinoviev and Kamenev,
on the other, over whether to make the October revolution in these
terms: There are two lines: one sets the course for the victory of
the revolution and relies on Europe, the second does not believe in
the revolution and counts only on being an opposition&#8217;. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a>
In the very midst of the revolution Trotsky, now speaking for the
Bolshevik government, repeated his prognosis of 1906:</p>

<p class="quoteb">If the peoples of Europe do not arise and crush
imperialism, we shall be crushed &#8211; that is beyond doubt. Either the
Russian revolution will raise the whirlwind of struggle in the West,
or the capitalists of all countries will stifle our struggle. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p class="fst">And Lenin, in an oft repeated argument, said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It is not open to the slightest doubt that the final
victory of our revolution, if it were to remain alone, if there were
no revolutionary movement in other countries, would be hopeless ...
Our salvation from all these difficulties, I repeat, is an
all-European revolution. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p class="fst">These were not, as Robin Blackburn claims, Lenin and Trotsky&#8217;s
&#8216;later justifications of the original Bolshevik seizure of power&#8217;.
<a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> They were the avowed perspective
of the Bolsheviks before, during and after the October revolution. It
was, concludes E.H. Carr, &#8216;the European revolution, on which the
confident calculations, not merely of a few optimists but of every
Bolshevik of any account, had been based&#8217;. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a>
And the Bolsheviks were not alone in looking to a European
revolution. Even Kautsky, in a passage from 1904 which somehow seems
to escape the notice of his modern admirers, acknowledged the
possibility of a revolution in Germany which:</p>

<p class="quoteb">must lead to the political domination of the proletariat
in Western Europe and create for the Eastern European proletariat the
possibility of contracting the stages of their development and,
copying the example of the Germans, artificially setting up socialist
institutions. Society as a whole cannot skip any stages in its
development, but it is possible for the constituent parts of society
to hasten their retarded development by imitating the more advanced
countries and, thanks to this, even to take their stand in the
forefront of development ... <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Kautsky&#8217;s post&#8211;1917 critique of the Bolsheviks depended on
casting off this creaking premonition of the theory of permanent
revolution. By then Kautsky was all too keen to avoid looking at
European capitalist society &#8216;as a whole&#8217; and to condemn a
revolution in one of its &#8216;constituent parts&#8217;. Yet even after the
October revolution, in the midst of his tirade against the
Bolsheviks, Kautsky could not quite shake off the power of the
Bolsheviks&#8217; analysis:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Bolsheviks must not be too much blamed for expecting
a European revolution. Other socialists did the same, and we are
certainly approaching conditions which will sharply accentuate the
class struggle, and which may have many surprises in store. And if
the Bolsheviks have till now been in error in expecting a revolution,
have not Bebel, Marx and Engels cherished a like delusion? This is
not to be denied. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This perspective was never the baseless optimism of which it is
accused by its latter day critics. It was founded on a detailed
examination of the way in which the world market, and with it
imperialism, had welded the capitalist world into a single organism.
It was an organism whose parts were simultaneously shaken by economic
crises and racked by war, and in which the great labour unrest of the
pre-First World War period had assumed similar intensity in a number
of major countries. Lenin and the Bolsheviks were alone in developing
a theory of imperialism which could explain the nature of modern
capitalism and the international scope of the class struggle which it
produced. No other socialists, including left Mensheviks like Martov,
even attempted such an analysis.</p>

<p>In the post-war years the Bolsheviks&#8217; prognosis was proved
absolutely correct. <em>There was a European wide revolutionary
upheaval</em>. The Easter Rising in Ireland pre-dated the October
revolution. The fall of the German Kaiser, precipitated by a naval
mutiny and a general strike, followed the revolution in November
1918. More revolutionary crises ensued. As Victor Serge recalls:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Revolution descended on the streets of Vienna and
Budapest ... From the Scheldt to the Volga the councils of workers&#8217;
and soldiers&#8217; deputies &#8211; the soviets &#8211; are the real masters of
the hour. Germany&#8217;s legal government is a Council of People&#8217;s
Commissars made up of six socialists. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In March 1919 a soviet government took power in Hungary and in the
same year massive labour unrest shook the British state to its
foundations. For &#8216;the two red years&#8217; Italy was convulsed by
massive class struggles, only brought to an end by what Serge
describes as &#8216;a preventative counter-revolution&#8217; <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a>
which brought Mussolini to power. Elsewhere Serge remembers:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The newspapers of the period are astonishing ... riots in
Paris, riots in Lyon, revolution in Belgium, revolution in
Constantinople, victory of the soviets in Bulgaria, rioting in
Copenhagen. In fact the whole of Europe is in movement, clandestine
or open soviets are appearing everywhere, even in the Allied armies;
everything is possible, everything. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p class="fst">At the other end of the political spectrum, Lloyd George wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The whole of Europe is filled with the spirit of
revolution. There is a deep sense not only of discontent but of anger
and revolt amongst the workmen against the pre-war conditions. The
whole existing order in its political, social and economic aspects is
questioned by the masses of the population from one end of Europe to
the other. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was on the basis of these class struggles, unprecedented in
scale and intensity, that the Third International was able to rally
to its banner mass Communist Parties numbering hundreds of thousands
of members in most European countries. By 1920 the Third
International could count on the following organisations: the Italian
Socialist Party, 300,000 strong; the Czechoslovak CP, with 400,000
members; the 140,000 of the French Socialist Party; the 35,478
comrades of the Bulgarian Socialists; the 17,000 members of the
Swedish Socialist Party; a mass German Communist Party, Norwegian
Labour Party and Yugoslav Socialist Party. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>

<p>What was lacking in these revolutionary upheavals was not the
objective European-wide crisis. Neither was it the willingness of
workers to struggle for power. What was lacking was a leadership of
sufficient clarity and an organisation with a core of sufficiently
experienced members to successfully lead these movements to power.
This was the decisive difference between the German and Russian
revolutions. It was a weakness which the Bolsheviks laboured
heroically to overcome in the Third International. It was certainly
not a struggle that was doomed to failure in advance.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviks correctly predicted a European revolution and they
strained might and main to provide that revolution with a leadership
which could bring it to a successful conclusion. They were right to
try. As Marx once observed, &#8216;world history would indeed be very
easy to make, if the struggle were taken up only on condition of
infallibly favourable chances.&#8217; <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a></p>

<p>What was Kautsky&#8217;s attitude to the German revolution? Surely
here, in the second most advanced industrial country of the day, none
of the arguments about the impermissibility of socialism in backward
countries need apply. While Kautsky <em>opposed</em> socialist
revolution in backward Russia, he would, surely, <em>support</em> it in
advanced Germany? Nothing of the sort. Kautsky opposed a socialist
revolution in the name of capitalist democracy every bit as
vehemently in Germany as he did in Russia. He declared Rosa Luxemburg
to be every bit as dangerous as Lenin. In debate with Luxemburg a
leader of Kautsky&#8217;s party, Hugo Haase, seemingly oblivious of the
contradiction, said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We cannot slavishly imitate the Bolshevik revolution
here, because the objective conditions are completely different.
Russia is a peasant country ... Only 10 percent of the population are
industrial workers. Germany, on the other hand, is a developed,
industrialised state which needs food supplies. The majority of its
population are proletarians. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Robin Blackburn is, of course, in the same bind. If the Russian
revolution was mistaken because it took place in a backward country,
then today, in Britain, the same injunction cannot apply. Yet Robin
Blackburn objects just as forcibly to a revolutionary strategy in
Britain today as he does to the Bolsheviks&#8217; strategy in 1917. The
unavoidable conclusion is that all the talk about &#8216;premature&#8217;
revolution, in Robin Blackburn and Kautsky&#8217;s cases, is an <em>excuse</em>
born of expediency, not a serious argument against revolutionary socialism.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>October: coup or revolution?</h4>

<p class="fst">The contrast between the spontaneous mass uprising of February
1917 and the &#8216;Bolshevik coup&#8217; of October 1917 is one of the
staples of right wing interpretation of the revolution. It is a view
which is gaining renewed force from events in Eastern Europe. As one
historian has recently observed:</p>

<p class="quoteb">[The] portrayal of the Bolshevik victory as the product
of the organisational skill of a ruthless, conspiratorial minority
has informed conventional wisdom in the West for so long that it has
made an all but indelible impression on popular assumptions about the
revolution. Although recent specialist work has cast doubt upon many
of its propositions, studies adhering to it continue to appear and it
still provides the common currency of Western media commentary.
Moreover, the spectacle of perestroika, of Communism repentant,
promises to lend it a new lease of life. The graver the travails of
the Soviet Union, the bolder the adherents of [this] view seem likely
to become. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus for Pipes the revolution was &#8216;a model of a modern coup
d&#8217;etat&#8217;. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a> Few socialists,
anarchists apart, have been willing to swallow much of the right wing
story. But while they accept that October was a genuine mass rising,
they tend to understate the degree to which the Bolsheviks had to
fight against <em>all</em> other socialist parties to make the
revolution possible in the first place. They also tend to
underestimate the intense polarisation that the revolution involved,
playing down the threat of counterrevolution. Both these arguments
are then used to buttress criticisms of the Bolsheviks&#8217;
post-October actions: their dispersal of the Constituent Assembly and
their conduct of the civil war.</p>

<p>But what had brought the Bolsheviks to power? Clearly their
programme and tactical flexibility were essential. But that is only
part of the story. The remainder is explained by how the other
parties responded to the growing crisis. The path from February to
October is not the royal road of the Bolsheviks&#8217; rise to power, it
is also the story of the other parties&#8217; steep descent in the
estimation of the mass of workers and peasants as they failed to give
adequate answers to the most pressing questions posed by the revolution.</p>

<p>The February revolution raised three key issues: the war, the land
and the factories. And there were three key political forces:
firstly, the old order whose most powerful remnants were the officer
corps of the Tsarist army supported, sometimes with reservations, by
the bourgeois Constitutional Democrats (Cadets). Secondly, there were
the parties of the working class the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks.
Finally there were the Socialist Revolutionaries (SRs), oriented on
and thinking of themselves as the representatives of the peasants,
though often led by intellectuals, lawyers and other sections of the
urban middle classes.</p>

<p>The regime which issued from the February revolution, headed by
the Provisional Government, was dominated by the Cadets. It refused
to distribute the land to the peasants, vowed to continue the war and
offered little to the workers. The Provisional Government had the
support of the Mensheviks and SRs who commanded a majority in the
soviets which mushroomed during and after the February revolution.</p>

<p>The economic and political paralysis of the regime drove a wedge
between the Provisional Government and the mass of workers, peasants
and soldiers. The first crisis of the Provisional Government came in
April. The issue was the war. The Cadet leader Miliukov provoked the
crisis by declaring that &#8216;Russia would fight to the last drop of
her blood&#8217;. It was an announcement which met with a bitter response
on the battlefields where Russian soldiers were &#8216;churned into
gruel&#8217;, according to General Sir Alfred Knox, &#8216;until casualties
in the firing line should make rifles available&#8217;. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p>Meetings, protests, street fights between pro-war and anti-war
demonstrators and, eventually, riots drove Miliukov from the
government. Indeed it brought an end to the purely bourgeois
government. The leaders of the moderate socialists joined a new
coalition government. As the Cadet Prince Trubetskoy wrote, &#8216;There
was apparently a wall between ourselves and the left, but it fell
down&#8217;. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a> As the Provisional
Government became progressively more unpopular it increasingly relied
on the SRs and other moderate socialists to lend it credibility,
ending with one such figure, Kerensky, as its leader.</p>

<p>The Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries were willing
co-optees. They were happy to participate in the Provisional
Government because they believed the revolution must limit itself to
bourgeois horizons. As Trotsky notes, &#8216;From the time of the first
revolution, the Mensheviks had inferred the necessity of a union with
the liberals from the bourgeois character of the revolution.&#8217; <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a></p>

<p>The leader of the Cadets agreed:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The socialist parties of the present time have a much
more intelligent view ... the revolution at the present time cannot
go further than the political victory of the bourgeoisie ... The
socialists have even managed to break with their own traditions and
doctrines and have entered the government. This represents a great
step forward ... <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This &#8216;intelligent view&#8217;, which &#8216;systematic thinkers&#8217; like
Robin Blackburn and Hobsbawm now laud as showing the October
revolution to be &#8216;premature&#8217;, was at the time the very theory
which earned its authors the contempt of the vast majority of workers
and peasants.</p>

<p>The moderate socialists earned this contempt by continuing
policies which mirrored those of the Cadet-only government. Kerensky
continued the insanity of the war effort by telling troops that &#8216;the
inevitability and necessity of sacrifice must rule the hearts of
Russian soldiers&#8217; and that &#8216;I summon you not to a feast but to
death&#8217;. To which one peasant replied, &#8216;What&#8217;s the use of the
peasants getting land if I&#8217;m killed and get no land?&#8217; It was an
argument whose elemental power launched tens of thousands of soldiers
on the long trek back to their villages. They simply walked away from
the front in the summer of 1917.</p>

<p>At the army headquarters the supposed representatives of &#8216;the
peasants in uniform&#8217; led a rather different life from those in the
barracks and trenches. Victor Serge records:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The supreme revolutionary authority was the committee of
the armies ... controlled by the Socialist Revolutionary party. This
committee hobnobbed amicably with the General Staff, denounced
Bolshevik plots and affirmed the indefatigable loyalty of the army to
the fatherland and Allies ... <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was no different on the home front. The Mensheviks and the
Socialist Revolutionaries temporised endlessly about declaring that
the land should betaken over by the peasants, despite the fact that
the peasants were already acting for themselves. The Mensheviks,
including Martov, were adamant in their opposition to workers&#8217;
control of the factories, again in spite of the fact that this was a
reality even before it became a Bolshevik slogan. But they could do
nothing to stop the crisis which was driving the workers to occupy
the factories and the peasants to seize the land: prices rose 2,300
percent between February and October and real wages fell by almost a
half. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a> The rate of bankruptcies and
closures rocketed. Strikes alone were not enough to combat this level
of social disintegration.</p>

<p>A second crisis erupted in July as Kerensky&#8217;s military offensive
failed and as the Provisional Government used Czech mercenaries to
drive recalled veterans to the front. The anger of the workers and
soldiers spontaneously boiled over into a near uprising &#8211; &#8216;more
than a demonstration and less than a revolution&#8217;, in Lenin&#8217;s
words. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a> At one point an angry mob
burst into the soviet and, white with anger, a worker jumped onto the
platform, shook his fist at the SR leader Chernov and shouted, Take
power, you son of a bitch, when it&#8217;s given you. &#8216;But the SRs and
Mensheviks had no intention of proclaiming, &#8216;All Power to the
Soviets.&#8217; As one historian generally unsympathetic to Bolshevism writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Too long used to debating the complexities of
revolutionary theory while they remained unschooled in revolutionary
practice, the men who stepped forward to lead the Petrograd Soviet
... proved to be timid advocates for Russia&#8217;s proletarians ...
these halting theorists preached that the revolution neither had &#8216;the
practical strength to bring about the rapid socialistic
transformation of Russia, nor were conditions ripe&#8217; for doing so.
Political power, they insisted, must be delivered first to those
sober politicians who represented Russia&#8217;s men and women of
property ... Petrograd&#8217;s workers and soldiers proved much less
willing to surrender their newly won revolutionary victories. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The immediate consequence of the July Days was not to increase the
support for the Bolsheviks. The wave of the revolution had broken
around the walls of the Provisional Government without yet being
powerful enough to breach them. As the movement temporarily ebbed,
reaction, confident that the moderate socialists were as fearful of
the masses as it was, seized its chance. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a></p>

<p>Just as polarisation was taking place within the soviet camp an
equal but opposite polarisation was taking place in the camp of the
bourgeoisie. Just as the soldiers, workers and peasants were
impatient for the Provisional Government and the moderate majority in
the soviets to resolve the situation decisively in their favour, so
the generals, the factory owners and the landlords were losing
patience with the Provisional Government&#8217;s inability to resolve the
situation once and for all in their favour. Inside the bourgeois camp
the mood began to swing in favour of a military dictatorship.
Kerensky ordered the formation of a special squad to hunt down Lenin
and shoot him on sight. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p>

<p>Trotsky and other leading Bolsheviks were imprisoned, Bolshevik
sympathisers were murdered and the organisation&#8217;s printing presses
smashed. &#8216;A common parlour topic became the need for an &#8220;exemplary&#8221;
German victory, to chasten the working class&#8217;. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a>
Marc Ferro has described what he calls this &#8216;terror in an minor key&#8217;:</p>

<p class="quoteb">A model of anti-Bolshevism was being assembled, and it
was reconstituted during the civil war. It was shaped between
February and October, and there was some similarity between it and
the Fascist model that came later in Italy and then Germany: it began
with resistance to social revolution, the primary role of leading
financiers and industrialists, with action by the army and the
church, denial of the class struggle, and an appeal to servicemen&#8217;s
masculine solidarity; it was followed by the use of &#8216;special action
groups&#8217;, the denunciation of governmental weakness, the emergence
of new men (often former revolutionaries who had supported the war),
with a leadership cult, anti-Semitism, attacks on democratic
organisations, and finally, the sympathy and armed intervention by
allied governments. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The appearance of General Kornilov in Moscow for the state
conference in August 1917, born aloft from his train by officers, was
the turning point. From that moment on the Provisional Government
became a fiction. Behind its fa&#231;ade the Bolsheviks prepared to
defend the revolution by ending dual power in favour of the soviets.
The right prepared to crush the revolution, the soviets and the
Provisional Government beneath the heel of the army. The choice was
either revolution or counter-revolution. Trotsky argued:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Just as out of the eagerness of the Petrograd masses
arose the semi-insurrection of July, so out of the impatience of the
property owners arose the Kornilov insurrection of August. And just
as the Bolsheviks found themselves obliged to take the side of an
armed insurrection, in order if possible to guarantee its success and
in any case to prevent its extermination, so the Cadets found
themselves obliged, for like purposes, to take part in the Kornilov
insurrection. Within these limits, there is an astonishing symmetry
in the two situations. But inside this symmetrical framework there is
a complete contrast of goals, methods and results. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Kornilov was clear that he and his fellow officers &#8216;would not
hesitate to hang all the soviet members if need be&#8217;, but he hoped
to operate under the wing of Kerensky&#8217;s government. Then a
Constituent Assembly could be summoned, quickly dispersed and
&#8216;Kerensky and Co will make way for me&#8217;. <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a>
&#8216;The <em>Kornilovshchina</em> was to begin, under the <em>Kerenshchina&#8217;s</em>
cover&#8217;. <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a> Kerensky belatedly
realised that Kornilov&#8217;s plans would end in his own demise and
turned to the soviets to defeat the Kornilov coup. The soviets, in
turn, were now disillusioned with Kerensky and increasingly looked to
the Bolsheviks for leadership.</p>

<p>So the same process which was draining popular support from the
Provisional Government towards the soviets also began, within the
soviets, to drain support away from the moderate socialists toward
the Bolsheviks. In August 1917 the president of the Mensheviks
declared that the organisation was in &#8216;total confusion. No one knew
what to do or how to proceed ... The Mensheviks and the SRs were
equally isolated from the people and from the soldiers.&#8217;
Plekhanov&#8217;s paper surveyed the work wrought by his theory that the
revolution was &#8216;premature&#8217; and concluded, &#8216;The Menshevik
faction is suffering one defeat after another, and one does not have
to be a prophet to foretell rapid demise&#8217;. <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a></p>

<p>In these circumstances the moderate socialists lost all purchase
on political reality. Continually declining in influence they were
tossed back and forth between wanting to prevent a second revolution
and realising that if they did not go forward they would be thrown
back into the arms of counter-revolution Kerensky&#8217;s increasingly
hysterical vacillations were the personification of this attitude.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviks&#8217; vital role in organising the defeat of the
Kornilov coup gave them the support of the majority in the soviets.
The Kornilov coup was defeated at the end of August and on 9
September the Bolsheviks won the majority in the Petrograd soviet,
Trotsky becoming its president. Between the defeat of Kornilov and
the October insurrection the task of the party was to organise its
supporters in the soviets, and indeed to convince some of the party&#8217;s
own leaders, so that the broken hulk of the Provisional Government
could be successfully deprived of the last vestiges of power.</p>

<p>Lenin insisted that the insurrection could only be the crowning
act of the mass revolution, not a party coup. Nikolai Podvoisky, the
Bolshevik head of the Petrograd soviet&#8217;s Military Revolutionary
Committee, recalled this conversation with Lenin on the eve of the
October revolution:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Comrade Lenin asked me what I thought of the work of the
Military Revolutionary Committee.</p>

<p class="quote">&#8216;The Military Revolutionary Committee&#8217;, I answered,
&#8216;is actually an extended bureau of the Military Organisations of
the Central Committee of our party.&#8217;</p>

<p class="quote">&#8216;And that is wrong!&#8217; said Vladimir llyich. &#8216;It
should not be a bureau, but a non-party insurrectionary body which
has full power and is connected with all sections of the workers and
soldiers. The committee must ensure that an unlimited number of
workers and soldiers are armed and participate in the insurrection.
The greater the initiative and activity of each member of the
Military Revolutionary Committee, the stronger and more effective
will be the influence of the entire committee on the masses. There
must not be the slightest hint of the dictatorship by the Military
Organisation over the Military Revolutionary Committee.&#8217; <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This was, of course, not the first time Lenin had had to argue the
difference between a revolution and a coup. Both the Mensheviks and
some of his own supporters, notably Zinoviev and Kamenev, had
objected that Lenin was planning a coup when he demanded practical
military preparations for the revolution. Lenin was variously accused
of Jacobinism, or of being a follower of the anarchist Bakunin or the
conspirator Blanqui. Lenin&#8217;s answer is worth quoting at length
since it shows both that he had no intention of mounting a coup and
precisely the preconditions for revolution which had been achieved by
October. These same arguments were contained in his pamphlet <strong>Marxism
and Insurrection</strong>, circulated in thousands of copies before the
October revolution:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Military conspiracy is Blanquism, <em>if</em> it is
organised not by a party of a definite class, if its organisers have
not analysed the political moment in general and the international
situation in particular, <em>if</em> the party has not on its side the
sympathy of the majority of the people, as proved by objective facts,
<em>if</em> the development of revolutionary events has not brought
about a practical refutation of the conciliatory illusion of the
petty bourgeoisie, <em>if</em> the majority of the soviet-type organs
of revolutionary struggle that have been recognised as authoritative
or have shown themselves to be such in practice have not been won
over, <em>if</em> there has not matured a sentiment in the army (if in
wartime) against the government that protracts the unjust war against
the will of the whole people, <em>if</em> the slogans of the uprising
(like &#8216;All Power to the Soviets&#8217;,&#8217;land to the peasants&#8217;, or
immediate offer of a democratic peace to all the belligerent nations&#8217;
... ) have not become widely popular, if the advanced workers are not
sure of the desperate situation of the masses and of the support of
the countryside, a support proved serious by a peasant movement or by
an uprising against the landowners and the government that defends
the landowners, if the country&#8217;s economic situation inspires
earnest hopes for a favourable solution of the crisis by peaceable
and parliamentary means. That is probably enough. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a></p>

<p class="fst">When Lenin believed that these conditions were <em>not</em> present,
during the July Days, he bent his every effort to <em>prevent</em> a
premature rising. Many other revolutionaries in Europe, as the German
revolution would show, were to pay with their lives for not being
able to make a similar assessment. But by October even Lenin&#8217;s
political enemies were forced to admit that he was no Jacobin. The
Menshevik N.N. Sukhanov writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">To talk about military conspiracy instead of national
insurrection, when the party was followed by the overwhelming
majority of the people, when the party had already <em>de facto</em>
conquered all real power and authority was clearly an absurdity. On
the part of the <em>enemies</em> of Bolshevism it was a <em>malicious</em>
absurdity, but on the part of the &#8216;cronies&#8217; [Zinoviev,
Kamenev] an aberration based on panic. Here Lenin was right ... <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Or as Robert Service simply expresses it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">What really counted was that the Bolshevik political
programme proved steadily more appealing to the mass of workers,
soldiers and peasants as social turmoil and economic ruin reached a
climax in late autumn. But for that there could have been no October
revolution. <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Martov wrote, &#8216;Understand, please, that before us after all is a
victorious uprising of the proletariat almost the entire proletariat
supports Lenin and expects its social liberation from the uprising&#8217;.
<a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a></p>

<p>Ultimately October was not a great contest between Menshevism and
Bolshevism, not between bourgeois democracy and soviet power but
between <em>bourgeois reaction</em> and military dictatorship,
on the one hand, and soviet power, on the other. The Mensheviks did
not understand this at the time of the revolution, they did not
understand it at the time of the dissolution of the Constituent
Assembly and they did not understand it during the civil war. The
Bolsheviks&#8217; ability to prevail lay in the fact that they did
understand this.</p>

<p>Those who dream today that there could have been a &#8216;third way&#8217;
which would have prevented the &#8216;premature&#8217; revolution of October
1917 need to think on two issues. Firstly, such a course was offered
to the workers of Russia in1917 and they rejected it and, secondly,
they rejected it in part because they saw behind the vacillations of
Kerensky the bayonet of Kornilov. Trotsky was right when he insisted
that fascism is the price paid by those who toy with revolution.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Bolsheviks: a monolithic party?</h4>

<p class="fst">The root of Stalinism is often said to lie in the Bolsheviks&#8217;
tyrannical and undemocratic party structure. This was the mantra
repeated by a generation of Cold War historians, now echoed in the
Russian media. Their central argument has been summarised with only a
hint of irony by liberal historian Stephen Cohen:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In October 1917, the Bolsheviks (Communists), a small,
unrepresentative, and already or embryonically totalitarian party,
usurped power and thus betrayed the Russian Revolution. From that
moment on, as in 1917, Soviet history was determined by the
totalitarian dynamics of the Communist Party, as personified by its
original leader, Lenin monopolistic politics, ruthless tactics,
ideological orthodoxy, programmatic dogmatism, disciplined
leadership, and centralised bureaucratic organisation. <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The left used to set its face firmly against what Cohen calls this
&#8216;malignant and inevitable straight line&#8217; theory. Now, however,
things have changed. Sam Farber connects Lenin&#8217;s attitude to
legality in the early Soviet state, which he defines as one of
&#8216;expediency at best and of contempt at worst&#8217;, with &#8216;Lenin&#8217;s
chronic distaste for codified rules, legal or otherwise&#8217;. This
attitude, Farber claims, &#8216;had sometimes played an important role in
his political practice concerning internal party organisation&#8217;.
<a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a> This lack of respect for &#8216;rules&#8217;
and &#8216;legality&#8217; helped pave the way for Stalin. For Robin
Blackburn, &#8216;Lenin&#8217;s Bolshevik current came to represent a species
of political voluntarism&#8217;. Lenin&#8217;s&#8217; cult of party organisation
and discipline&#8217; was a &#8216;double-edged discovery&#8217; which helped &#8216;to
fashion a political force that could be used for purposes he did not
approve&#8217;, a fact which he only recognised at the end of his life.
And although Lenin &#8216;does not carry full responsibility&#8217; he and
Trotsky &#8216;cannot escape the charge of having themselves prepared the
ground for Stalin&#8217;. <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a></p>

<p>These are remarkable sentiments to hear from socialists,
especially since much research done by liberal historians over the
last 30 years has demonstrated beyond all doubt that the Bolsheviks
were, until shortly before Stalin&#8217;s rise to power in 1928, an
organisation who were fanatical in only one sense: their devotion to
internal debate and argument.</p>

<p>Lenin&#8217;s early insistence on discipline and organisation in <strong>What
is to be Done?</strong> (1902) was a product of the chaos and anarchy that
reigned in the revolutionary movement at that time. Local groups
proliferated without contact with one another. Primitive and
amateurish, prey to police agents, they were often arrested before
they produced their first leaflet. The upsurge of strike activity
from which they had emerged had marked them with a healthy desire to
participate in the struggle but with a marked unwillingness to relate
this struggle to the wider issues of socialist change within society.</p>

<p>The famous themes of <strong>What is to be Done?</strong> addressed
themselves to these weaknesses. Where there were only leaflets, Lenin
demanded a party press. Where there was amateurishness, Lenin
demanded professionalism. Where there was syndicalism and economism,
Lenin demanded socialist politics. Where there was localism, Lenin
demanded coordination and centralisation. And all this itself
demanded an active, not passive, membership. Illegal conditions
required a high level of commitment from &#8216;professional&#8217;
revolutionaries. All these formulations from <strong>What is to be Done?</strong>
were at the time supported by Trotsky and by Martov.</p>

<p>On occasions Lenin&#8217;s arguments overstated the case &#8211; a
necessary evil given the chaos above which he was trying to rise. It
was untrue that socialism could only come to the workers &#8216;from the
outside&#8217; and it was untrue that workers could spontaneously reach
only trade union consciousness &#8211; faults which Lenin was only too
pleased to acknowledge three years later when he announced that
workers were &#8216;spontaneously&#8217; socialist during the 1905 revolution
and that the party should open its gates wide to admit as many of
them as possible. <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a> Even when
illegality and repression obliged the Bolsheviks to adopt tighter
organisation they were far from the totalitarian organisation of
legend. As one liberal historian notes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The image of a tightly knit bunch of inveterate
conspirators, so sedulously cultivated by their enemies, was ... a
cruel mockery of their real condition. Indeed so much of their public
reputation was wide of the mark. They did not look upon Lenin, even
when he succeeded in keeping in contact with underground committees,
as the only acceptable source of plans and policies. They did not
regard <strong>What is to be Done?</strong> as an organisational blueprint ...
they in fact wanted to found a mass socialist party as soon as it was
practicable. <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Bolsheviks were so far from being a monolithic party that
Lenin had enormous difficulty in getting many committees to separate
from the Mensheviks at all. Even in 1917 there were still joint
committees in some parts of Russia. At all points from 1905 to 1917
the Bolsheviks were a party in which heated discussion was the norm.
They divided over boycotting and later participating in the Duma,
over participation in the police inspired trade unions, over the
philosophical dispute between Lenin and Bogdanov and over a host of
lesser issues.</p>

<p>In 1917 itself &#8216;controversy was the lifeblood of Central
Committee activity&#8217;. <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a> They were
of course famously divided over the very nature of the revolution,
over if and when to call for a second revolution. After the
revolution they divided over whether there should be a coalition with
other socialists, over whether the elections to the Constituent
Assembly should be rerun and about whether there should be a peace
with German imperialism. This last had for a time ... brought the
party to the edge of the abyss of total disintegration&#8217;. <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a>
Yet it did not prevent further arguments over military policy during
the civil war, the role of trade unions under socialism and,
repeatedly, over economic issues. In his study of the internal
organisation of the Bolsheviks, Robert Service notes that even though
the devastating experience of the civil war had sapped the inner life
of the party:</p>

<p class="quoteb">This is not to say that the Bolshevik party of the mid&#8211;1920s was
yet the regimented grotesquerie it was to appear in the 1930s ...
with all these controversies raging throughout the 1920s it would be
ludicrous to maintain that the stuffing had been completely knocked
out of Bolshevik life not long after the civil war. <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a></p>

<p class="fst">These arguments often split the Bolsheviks from top to bottom, as
any serious argument in a revolutionary party is likely to do. At all
times, but especially in 1917, &#8216;insubordination was the rule of the
day whenever lower party bodies thought questions of importance were
at stake&#8217;. <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a> During 1917 the
Vyborg committee of the party sent out its own agitators to tour the
Baltic arguing against the Petrograd committee&#8217;s tolerant attitude
towards the Provisional Government:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Nor was there a well established system of subordination and
discipline along the hierarchical chain stretching from the Central
Committee at the apex to the primary &#8216;cells&#8217; at the base. Tension
and conflict were the rule, not the exception. If anything committees
tended to be called into account from below rather than above. Rank
and file members and lower activists could not only make their views
known at general open meetings but also re-elect their
representatives at frequent intervals ... few leaders succeeded in
acting in opposition to the viewpoint of their committee colleagues
over a lengthy period. <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was frequently the local party committees which inundated the
Central Committee secretariat with demands for more precise
guidelines about what they should do. Often Sverdlov, in charge of
the secretariat, could only tell them to look at <strong>Pravda</strong> for
guidance. As October approached he was unable to do more than tell
one inquirer, &#8216;You understand, comrade, that it is difficult to
give you instructions any more concrete than &#8220;All Power to the
Soviets&#8221; ... except to add that it is of supreme importance to take
charge of the post and telegraph offices and also the railway&#8217;.
<a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a> This minimal guidance, even in
Petrograd, was not always followed: both the comrades charged with
leading the detachment which seized the general telegraph office
forgot to bring the revolvers.</p>

<p>So what is left of the importance of organisation and the
operation of democratic centralism if this is a true picture of how
the Bolsheviks worked? Actually, a great deal. A revolutionary party
operates precisely by being in a relationship of &#8216;tension and
conflict&#8217; both with the mass of the working class and with the
ordinary members of the party who are subject to the pressure of the
mass of workers.</p>

<p>Without such pressure, without the tumultuous democracy and debate
which is the ordinary functioning of a revolutionary organisation, it
is impossible for the party to learn what is going on in the class,
to discuss and debate its own experience and to formulate policy. But
without the constant attempt to rationalise and systematise its work
and its arguments the party cannot act as the organ which attempts to
lead the class &#8211; that is why a party must try to discipline the
debate and discussion, even while it welcomes it. The only means that
the leadership of the party has to achieve this is the power of
argument and the record of its previous decisions. The stronger this
record, the more frequently the party and its leadership have been
proved right in struggle, the more weight it carries in the class and
with its own rank and file. And, in the last resort, the power of the
leadership&#8217;s arguments will depend on how quickly and effectively
it learns from workers in struggle, the only real source of theory.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviks could tolerate a high level of internal debate
because they had, over many years, created a high level of agreement
on general politics and a wide knowledge of the Marxist tradition.
Equally importantly they had sought at every available opportunity to
root themselves in the working class, training their members never to
stand aloof from the struggle and to express the party&#8217;s ideas in
terms which fitted the experience of those in struggle. In contrast,
Rosa Luxemburg&#8217;s Spartacus League had neither a common theoretical
framework nor well established links with at least an advanced
minority of workers. This is why it could neither act in a concerted
manner during key turning points in the struggle, nor could it
withstand fierce debate without running the risk of immobilising the
organisation. <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a></p>

<p>Once this dialectical relationship between the Bolsheviks and the
working class was broken, shattered because the working class itself
was broken backed after the civil war, freedom of debate gradually
and inevitably became first a monologue of the party with itself and
then merely a dispute among the leaders of the party.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Constituent Assembly</h4>

<p class="fst">The dissolution of the Constituent Assembly by the Bolsheviks in
January 1918 is one of their most contentious acts. It outraged
Kautsky and became one of the key accusations in <strong>The Dictatorship
of the Proletariat</strong>, his polemic against the October revolution.
Robin Blackburn is obviously sympathetic to Martov&#8217;s view that the
&#8216;bourgeois democratic revolution should be championed by Marxists&#8217;.
Blackburn goes on to argue that &#8216;consistent with this position,
Martov opposed dissolution of the Constituent Assembly in 1918 while
still favouring an independent role for the soviets and trade
unions.&#8217; Martov, says Blackburn, &#8216;attacked the Bolsheviks for a
sort of lumpen anarchism which failed to see the importance of
establishing a lawful and democratic polity based on an authoritative
state&#8217;. <a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a> Robin Blackburn isn&#8217;t
above bracketing Kautsky and Rosa Luxemburg together as &#8216;notable
Marxists of the day&#8217; who &#8216;repudiated the practice of party
dictatorship from the very beginning&#8217;. <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a></p>

<p>In an earlier issue of <strong>New Left Review</strong> Tim Wohlforth puts
the same kind of argument in more general terms. &#8216;It is hard to
view the young Soviet state as <em>structurally</em> superior to the
systems of parliamentary, &#8220;bourgeois&#8221; democracy excoriated in
Leninist doctrine&#8217;, argues Wohlforth. He goes on to say that
soviets should be supplemented by &#8216;the direct election by universal
suffrage and secret ballot, through free competition of parties, of
the highest decision-making body of government&#8217;. <a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a></p>

<p>Sam Farber is half willing to defend the Bolsheviks, but &#8216;<em>only
if we assume</em> that their arguments in defence of the soviet system
... represented a genuine long-term commitment to that alternative
form of democratic government&#8217;. <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a>
Yet this is precisely what Farber is <em>not</em> willing to assume
since his whole book is supposed to demonstrate that the Bolsheviks
failed to show any such commitment. Sam Farber too quotes Rosa
Luxemburg, whose criticism of the Bolsheviks&#8217; dissolution of the
Constituent Assembly is cited by right wingers who would never dream
of endorsing any other word that she wrote. In particular, they
forget her accolade to Lenin and Trotsky who, she said, had been &#8216;the
salvation of the honour of international socialism&#8217;. <a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a></p>

<p>The essential problem with all these criticisms is that they ask
the question: if we were the founding fathers of the workers&#8217;
constitution, what democratic blueprint would we propose? The
question they do <em>not</em> ask is: in the struggle for power which
institutions represent the interests of the workers and which the
interests of the ruling class? Around which institutions are the
opposing classes rallying? These questions need careful analysis in a
revolutionary period because the role of the different institutions
alters dramatically depending on the balance of class forces.</p>

<p>Before the October revolution all the socialist parties, including
the Bolsheviks, had been in favour of calling the Constituent
Assembly. Yet the Provisional Government, both before and after the
socialists joined it, had delayed calling the Assembly. This delay
had a social root. If the elections had been held the Mensheviks and
SRs would have had a majority. This would have forced them to address
the land question, the ending of the war and the occupations of the
factories. This would have meant that they would either have had to
agree to the Bolsheviks&#8217; programme &#8216;Land, Bread and Peace&#8217; or
they would have had to try and claw back the already half established
gains of the revolution. That would have meant siding with the
counter-revolution against the mass of workers and peasants.</p>

<p>So the Provisional Government did what it was best at: it
temporised and made excuses. On the one hand it said that it could
not decide the key questions of the day because it was only a
<em>provisional</em> government. On the other hand it delayed calling
the one body which it maintained did have such power, the Constituent
Assembly. In these circumstances the Bolsheviks called all the more
vociferously for the Constituent Assembly as a way of showing that
the bourgeois democrats had no intention of even carrying through the
tasks of the bourgeois revolution. Meanwhile, they continued to
insist that the tasks of the revolution could only be met by
transferring all power to the soviets.</p>

<p>Even before the October revolution the mass of workers understood
clearly that the soviets were their organisations, responsive to
their needs, and that the Assembly was a chimera of which they knew
little and from which they expected less. Boris Sokolov, one of the
leaders of the SRs, explains this graphically:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Of all the political parties the Socialist Revolutionary
Party was linked with the idea of the Constituent Assembly by
extremely close, might even say organic, ties ... It seemed to them,
and not only to them, that the crucial thing was to &#8216;bring the
country to the Constituent Assembly&#8217;. Theoretically perhaps, and
probably in fact, there was a very great truth in this, but
practically this peculiar idealism was fraught with the most
exasperating consequences and complications.</p>

<p class="quote">This was especially because the people were far from
being fully imbued with faith in the saving power of the Constituent
Assembly ... In the beginning, during the first few months after the
revolution, the Constituent Assembly was something absolutely unknown
and unclear to the mass of front line soldiers ... their sympathies
leaned completely, openly, and frankly to the soviets. These were
institutions that were near and dear to them, reminding them of
village assemblies ... From the very first days, the meetings of the
soviets influenced their decisions. Both the army committee, which
the soldiers called &#8216;our soviet&#8217;, and the soviets in the capital
cities seemed close to them, and their activities comprehensible.
During the first few months I more than once had occasion to hear
objections to the Constituent Assembly from soldiers, and not from
the least intelligent ones at that. To most of them the Assembly was
associated with the State Duma, an institution that was remote to
them. &#8216;What do we need some Constituent Assembly for when we have
our soviets, where our deputies meet and which can decide everything
and know how to go about everything?&#8217; <a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a></p>

<p class="fst">After the October revolution had transferred power to the soviets,
the SRs and the Mensheviks no longer wished to delay calling the
Constituent Assembly for now it had been transformed from a looming
embarrassment into a potential base from which they might be able to
regain all that they had just lost. Again the mood was very different
among the rank and file. Sokolov reports from a congress of soldiers
held on the south western front, where, it should be noted, Bolshevik
influence was much less than on the north western front:</p>

<p class="quoteb">A majority of the congress belonged to the SR Party,
which had approximately two thirds of the delegates. The remaining
third adhered to the Bolsheviks or a small number to the Ukrainians.
However, some of the SRs, primarily those sent by rearguard units in
the front line zone, took an ambiguous position, which could best be
summed up as follows: since the Provisional Government no longer
exists and since the Constitutional Assembly has not yet been
convened, all the power in the country ought to go to the soviets ...</p>

<p class="quote">The disputes that developed on this question showed how
contradictory the mood was even among the delegates ... They
discussed the advantages of the soviet system over parliamentarianism
and emphasised the fact, which seemed indisputable to most, that the
soviets were better than the Provisional Government since the
&#8216;soviets, you know, are ours&#8217;. Even the arrival of the former
Provisional Government minister Avksentiev at this congress and his
many speeches in defence of the slogan &#8216;All Power to the
Constituent Assembly&#8217;, did not convince the majority ... The front
line congress, though not by a very large majority, expressed itself
in favour of the formulation proposed by the Bolsheviks. It spoke out
for power to the soviets &#8211; essentially for Bolshevik power. <a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Thus these soldiers understood through experience what had become,
since Marx&#8217;s writings on the Paris Commune, a cornerstone of
revolutionary theory: that the soviet is a superior form of democracy
because it unifies political and economic power &#8211; unlike parliament
which leaves the most important power of the bourgeoisie, its
economic strength, untouched; because it brings under democratic
control the administrative and legislative functions of government &#8211;
unlike parliament which leaves the civil service, army and police in
unelected hands; and, most of all, because the soviet is an organ of
struggle responsive to the will of the workers and capable of
directly organising strikes, protests and so on.</p>

<p>A parliament could be a rallying point for the bourgeoisie during
their revolution precisely because they aimed only at <em>political</em>
power. In general they were already masters, or near masters, of the
economy. The Long Parliament of 1640 in England and the Constituent
Assembly of 1789 in France therefore restricted themselves to
conquering state power on behalf of an already economically powerful
class. Even in these cases parliamentary institutions had to be
propelled forward by, respectively, the arms of the New Model Army
and the force of the great popular mobilisations led by the Jacobin
clubs. In both the English and the French revolutions the most
radical sections of the bourgeoisie even had to purge their own
parliamentary institutions in order for the revolution to succeed.</p>

<p>But the socialist revolution must counterpose the soviet to
parliament, just as the bourgeoisie counterposed parliament to the
court, precisely because it needs an organ which combines economic
power &#8211; the power to strike and take control of the workplaces &#8211;
with an insurrectionary bid for political power, breaking the old
state and replacing it with a more democratic workers&#8217; state.</p>

<p>The bourgeoisie and the SRs clearly understood this and were keen
to restore all the old separations inherent in a bourgeois state as
the first step on the road to counter-revolution. The Constituent
Assembly was a rallying point for the right. The SRs planned what was
effectively a counter-revolution to coincide with the opening of the
Constituent Assembly:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Everything was ready to transform the event into an
insurrection. Thirty armoured cars were to advance against the Smolny
[the Bolshevik headquarters]; SR regiments would have supported the
coup. <a href="#n72" name="f72">[72]</a></p>

<p class="fst">&#8216;For weeks all preparations had been made with this end in view.
But by the new year it was evident that a strictly military coup
could not succeed,&#8217; comments Radkey, the historian of the SRs. <a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a>
At the last moment the SR leadership called off the rising.
Nevertheless the SR terrorist fraction still made plans to kidnap
Lenin and Trotsky and on 2 January 1918, three days before the
Assembly was due to open, two shots were fired at Lenin&#8217;s car. And
in southern Russia the first White &#8216;volunteer army&#8217; under General
Kaledin was already fighting soviet power under the banner of the
Constituent Assembly. Under these circumstances it would have been
absurd for the Bolsheviks to allow this invitation to
counter-revolution to remain open, even if the elections to it had
been scrupulously fair according to the lights of parliamentary democracy.</p>

<p>In fact they were not fair even according to those limited
criteria. Firstly, the elections only achieved a 50 percent turnout
and in some parts of Russia no poll was held at all. On some sections
of the front, officers hid the fact that the Provisional Government
had fallen. Secondly, the SRs had split after their election lists
had been drawn up. This meant that the Right SRs (RSRs) who were
little different to the &#8216;left&#8217; Cadets, dominated. The Left SRs
(LSRs), who were close to the Bolsheviks, only got their lists out to
some of the central Russian regions.</p>

<p>Thus the three weeks of polling which gave a massive majority to
the RSRs and about 25 percent of the votes to the Bolsheviks were
highly unrepresentative of the real situation. A brief look at three
of the areas where the LSRs did manage to stand candidates reveals
how much the result would have altered had they been allowed to stand
everywhere. In Petrograd the LSRs received 16.2percent of the vote
and the RSRs 0.5 percent; in Kazan the LSRs got 18.9 percent and the
RSRs 2.1 percent; in the Baltic Fleet 26.9 percent voted for the
LSRs, while just 11.9 percent voted for the RSRs. <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a>
Even allowing for the fact that these were favourable areas for the
LSRs it is clear that the election results were a mockery of the real
situation in Russia in 1917. <a href="#n75" name="f75">[75]</a> The
elections to the all-Russian congresses of the soviets give a much
more accurate picture of the Bolsheviks&#8217; support <a href="#n76" name="f76">[76]</a>;</p>

<p class="fst">The real weakness of the bourgeoisie was symbolically represented
by the scene at the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly. &#8216;Meeting
in this atmosphere of botched insurrection, the Constituent Assembly
felt itself doomed&#8217;, records Victor Serge. <a href="#n77" name="f77">[77]</a>
Certainly when the anarchist commander of the Red Guard, to chants
of &#8216;That&#8217;s enough! That&#8217;s enough!&#8217; from a packed gallery,
approached the chairman and told him that the Assembly would have to
disperse because &#8216;the guard is tired&#8217;, the delegates went meekly enough.</p>

<p>The only outcry was a small demonstration, dispersed with a few
casualties by the sailors, which even Sokolov described as &#8216;absurd,
ridiculous&#8217;. Victor Serge states that, &#8216;The dissolution of the
Constituent Assembly made a great sensation abroad. In Russia, it
passed almost unnoticed&#8217;. <a href="#n78" name="f78">[78]</a> And
that doyen of Cold Warriors Leonard Shapiro comments, &#8216;It was the
end of the Constituent Assembly. Its dispersal caused little stir in
the country and was reported to have been treated with indifference
in the army&#8217;. <a href="#n79" name="f79">[79]</a> W.H. Chamberlin,
the <strong>Christian Science Monitor</strong>&#8217;s Moscow correspondent in the
1920s, records in his valuable, though anti-Bolshevik, <strong>The Russian
Revolution</strong> that the dismissal of the Constituent Assembly &#8216;evoked
scarcely a ripple of interest and protest, so far as the masses were
concerned.&#8217; Even Pipes is forced to admit that &#8216;the dissolution
of the Assembly met with surprising indifference&#8217;. <a href="#n80" name="f80">[80]</a></p>

<p>There can be little doubt that if the situation had been reversed,
that is if a Bolshevik-dominated Constituent Assembly had been
elected while the right-wing still commanded sufficient armed force,
they would have dismissed the Assembly.</p>

<p>Once again the German revolution provides a negative proof of the
correctness of the Bolsheviks&#8217; attitude to the Constituent
Assembly. The revolution of 9 November 1918 had been won on the basis
of strike action, mutiny and the rise of workers&#8217; councils. But the
German soviets, like their Russian counterparts after the February
revolution, were dominated by reformists. The government of People&#8217;s
Commissars, drawn from the reformist SPD and the centrist USPD,
immediately began to argue that the soviets had done a marvellous job
in getting rid of the Kaiser, but that they should now prepare to
hand over power to a Constituent, or National, Assembly. This was
Kautsky&#8217;s repeated theme during these months. <a href="#n81" name="f81">[81]</a></p>

<p>Confronted with the practical question, &#8216;National Assembly or
soviets?&#8217; Rosa Luxemburg, less than a year after she first made her
criticisms of the Bolsheviks&#8217; attitude to the Constituent Assembly,
immediately abandoned them. Sam Farber mentions this change of heart
in a fleeting phrase, but then hurries on like a rich man avoiding a
beggar. Let&#8217;s halt this guilty conscience in its tracks and see
what Luxemburg said. She pilloried &#8216;the National Assembly as an
attempt to assassinate both the revolution and the workers&#8217; and
soldiers&#8217; councils&#8217;. <a href="#n82" name="f82">[82]</a> And her
paper, <strong>Rote Fahne</strong>, declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The National Assembly is a device with which to cheat the
proletariat out of its power, paralyse its class energy, and make its
final goals vanish into thin air. The alternative is to put all power
into the hands of the proletariat, develop this incipient revolution
into a mighty class struggle for a socialist order, and to this end
establish the political supremacy of the working masses, the
dictatorship of the workers&#8217; and soldiers&#8217; councils. For or
against socialism, for or against the National Assembly. There is no
third choice! <a href="#n83" name="f83">[83]</a></p>

<p class="fst">These were prophetic phrases. In the end the reformist led
counter-revolution felt strong enough to strike without waiting for
the National Assembly to be convened. But the propaganda for the
Assembly had done its work in demoralising and demobilising the
workers&#8217; councils. In Germany the contest of dual power was
resolved in favour of the bourgeoisie, with the help of propaganda
about the National Assembly.</p>

<p>The right exacted a terrible price. Armed bands of right wing
troops, the Freikorps, the swastika on their arms and the Constituent
Assembly as their slogan <a href="#n84" name="f84">[84]</a>,
inaugurated a reign of terror. Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht, Leo
Jogiches and Eugene Levine, the outstanding leaders of the German
revolution, were murdered. In Berlin alone 3,000 workers were
slaughtered in pitched battles with the Freikorps. It was a
counter-revolution planned and led by the reformist SPD. Its
figurehead was SPD deputy Gustav Noske. In Noske&#8217;s own words:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Nobody made any objection when I expressed the view that
order would have to be restored by force of arms. The Minister of
War, Colonel Reinhardt, drafted an order appointing as
commander-in-chief General Hoffmann ... It was objected that this
general would be too unpopular with the workers ... I insisted that a
decision must be taken. Somebody said: &#8216;Perhaps you&#8217;ll do the job
yourself?&#8217; To this I replied, briefly and resolutely: &#8216;I don&#8217;t
mind, somebody&#8217;s got to be the bloodhound. I&#8217;m not afraid of the
responsibility!&#8217; It was decided forthwith that the government would
grant me extraordinary powers for the purpose of re-establishing
order in Berlin. In his draft, Reinhardt struck out the name of
Hoffmann and replaced it by mine. That is how I was appointed to the
post of commander-in-chief. <a href="#n85" name="f85">[85]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Four days after the murder of Luxemburg and Liebknecht the
elections for the National Assembly took place. When it met, the SPD
formed a coalition with the two bourgeois parties. In Russia the
Bolsheviks&#8217; ability to win the majority in the soviets to take
power meant the crushing of the Constituent Assembly as a centre for
counter-revolution, at least in the heart of Russia. Henceforth
counter-revolutionary assemblies were expelled into the south and to
the east of the Urals. In Germany the Spartacus League&#8217;s weakness
and in experience allowed a reformist leadership of the workers&#8217;
councils to crush the revolution and hand power to a bourgeois assembly.</p>

<p>The scale of that tragedy spread all the way from Berlin to
Petrograd and Moscow. Without a successful German revolution the
Bolsheviks were thrown back into a bloody civil war with only limited
resources. The revolution was under siege.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The civil war and the White Terror</h4>

<p class="fst">The civil war was a bloody and brutal era. On many occasions the
life of the Soviet regime hung by a thread. To survive at all the
regime underwent a severe change which dramatically altered the
elementary freedoms which the Bolsheviks, like everyone else, took
for granted in the first period of Soviet power.</p>

<p>For many writers it was in this period of War Communism that the
first seeds of Stalinism were sown. Joe Slovo argues, &#8216;the
foundation for the institutionalised separation of socialism and
democracy, both in the party and in society, was laid in ideological
practices which preceded the emergence of an economically privileged
strata.&#8217; He cites Trotsky&#8217;s writings from the period of War
Communism as containing &#8216;quite a few ideological positions which
also degrade the ideas of communism&#8217;. <a href="#n86" name="f86">[86]</a>
For Robin Blackburn:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8217;War Communism&#8217;, with its far-reaching attempt to
replace all exchange by requisitioning ... cast a blight on
small-scale production in this backward country. It was also
associated with an intensified and hardened Bolshevik sense of
destiny that would brook no opposition. <a href="#n87" name="f87">[87]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Sam Farber is happy to repeat Robert C. Tucker&#8217;s designation of
this period as &#8216;Stalinist Leninism&#8217; and goes on to argue:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The governmental euphoria with War Communism also
implicitly revealed the political and ideological priorities of
mainstream Bolshevism. Thus, while this set of policies greatly
expanded the powers of the central state and vigorously attempted to
reduce the role of the market, at the same time it not only
consolidated the Red Terror but for all intents and purposes
eliminated workers&#8217; control of industry and democracy in the
soviets. Again there is no evidence indicating that Lenin or any
mainstream Bolshevik leaders lamented the loss of workers&#8217; control
or of democracy in the soviets ... <a href="#n88" name="f88">[88]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Slovo, Sam Farber and, to a lesser extent, Robin Blackburn all
have a similar methodological refrain to back up this attitude. It
runs like this: yes, objective conditions were bad during the civil
war, but this can&#8217;t explain everything. This simplified form of
economic determinism has its limits&#8217;, says Slovo. <a href="#n89" name="f89">[89]</a>
There must, therefore, have been some weakness in Bolshevik theory.
For Sam Farber &#8216;ideological inebriation&#8217; among the Bolsheviks&#8217;
negates the claim that War Communism ... was simply imposed on the
government by objective necessity&#8217;. <a href="#n90" name="f90">[90]</a></p>

<p>This sounds like sophisticated Marxism: rejecting crude economic
determinism in the name of taking &#8216;political factors&#8217; into
account. But, properly used, Marxism does not suggest that in every
circumstance political will or ideology can play a key role. The
degree to which workers can &#8216;make their own history&#8217; depends on
the weight of objective factors bearing down on them. At the height
of the revolutionary wave such freedom can be considerable. In the
concentration camp it can be reduced to virtually zero.</p>

<p>Of course there was a point on the revolutionary front where
consciousness, theory and organisation were decisive for the
Bolshevik revolution at this time: that point was the European,
particularly the German, revolution. But in Russia the limits of
action were reduced to withstanding a siege, under ever narrowing
constrictions. Every ounce of will power and political consciousness
was necessary to keep the workers&#8217; state from being overcome. The
&#8216;subjective factor&#8217; was reduced to a choice between capitulation
to the Whites or defending the revolution with whatever means were at
hand. Within these limits Bolshevik policy was decisive. But it could
not wish away the limits and start with a clean sheet. It is a
tribute to the power of the Bolsheviks&#8217; politics and organisation
that they took the measures necessary and withstood the siege for so long.</p>

<p>To decide in any given circumstance the weight of the subjective
and objective factors demands a concrete analysis of the balance of
forces. This is precisely what is missing in most accounts. Sam
Farber cheerfully brandishes his desire to concentrate on the
political, and criticises others who see &#8216;the question of democracy
as if it was in some way derivative of economics&#8217;. Presumably, in
this schema, &#8216;democracy&#8217; is equally possible under starving,
plague ridden feudalism as it is under 20th century capitalism. In
Sam Farber&#8217;s analysis of the civil war we are blankly told that
&#8216;the atrocities carried out by the White Terror are assumed to be
given&#8217;. <a href="#n91" name="f91">[91]</a> Yet this is what <em>cannot</em>
be assumed to be given. If we do not give a full account of the
economic crisis, the international situation and the depth of the
White Terror how can we be expected to judge how far the Bolsheviks
acted from necessity? How can we assess the force of circumstance?</p>

<p>So what were the conditions facing the Bolsheviks? The civil war
broke over a country already decimated by the First World War. By
1918 Russia was producing just 12 percent of the steel it had
produced in 1913. More or less the same story emerged from every
industry: iron ore had slumped to 12.3 percent of its 1913 figure;
tobacco to 19 percent; sugar to 24 percent; coal to 42 percent; linen
to 75 percent. The country was producing just one fortieth of the
railway track it had manufactured in 1913. <a href="#n92" name="f92">[92]</a>
And by January 1918 some 48 percent of the locomotives in the country
were out of action. <a href="#n93" name="f93">[93]</a> Factories
closed, leaving Petrograd with just a third of its former workforce
by autumn 1918. Hyperinflation raged at levels only later matched in
the Weimar Republic. The amount of workers&#8217; income that came from
sources other than wages rose from 3.5 percent in 1913 to 38 percent
in 1918 &#8211; in many cases desperation drove workers to simple theft.
The workers&#8217; state was as destitute as the workers: the state
budget for 1918 showed income at less than half of expenditure. <a href="#n94" name="f94">[94]</a></p>

<p>Starvation came hard on the heels of economic devastation. In the
spring of 1918 the food ration in Moscow and Petrograd sank to just
10 percent of that needed to sustain a manual worker. <a href="#n95" name="f95">[95]</a>
Now it was Chicherin, the People&#8217;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs,
who ironically repeated the threat first made by the millionaire
Ryabushynski: &#8216;The bony hand of hunger may throttle the Russian
Revolution&#8217;. <a href="#n96" name="f96">[96]</a> Disease necessarily
walked hand in hand with starvation, claiming perhaps 7 million lives
during the civil war, the same number of deaths as that suffered by
Russians in the First World War. The tone of this cry from Lenin
testifies to the seriousness of the crisis in 1918:</p>

<p class="quoteb">For God&#8217;s sake, use the <em>most</em> energetic and
<em>revolutionary</em> measures to send <em>grain</em>, <em>grain</em> and
<em>more grain</em>!!! Otherwise, Piter [Petrograd] may perish. <a href="#n97" name="f97">[97]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was against this backcloth of economic devastation that the
civil war took place. October had been a decisive turning point in
the revolution, but it was far from the end of the struggle. As
Chamberlin observes, &#8216;the alternative to Bolshevism, had it failed
to survive the ordeal of civil war ... would not have been Chernov,
opening a Constituent Assembly ... but a military dictator, a Kolchak
or a Denikin, riding into Moscow on a white horse&#8217;. <a href="#n98" name="f98">[98]</a></p>

<p>Most historians treat the revolution and the civil war as separate
processes. In reality they were one. The attempted suppression of the
Bolsheviks in July 1917 and the Kornilov revolt the following month
had been the precursors of civil war before the revolution. Just
three days after the revolution, while the revolution itself still
hung in the balance in Moscow, the workers of Petrograd were out
digging trenches before the city to defend it from General Krasnov&#8217;s
Cossacks who, with Kerensky, had already captured Tsarskoye Selo a
few miles from the capital.</p>

<p>The following day Colonel Polkovnikov led an insurrection of the
junkers of the military school in Petrograd. They captured the
central telegraph office and Commissar Antonov before they were
defeated. Antonov kept his promise to ensure their safety. But the
junkers did not keep their promise not to bear arms against the
soviets and, as soon as they were released, threaded their way
through Red territory toward the centres of White resistance in the
Don and Kuban territories and in the Ukraine where White armies were
already forming.</p>

<p>The day after the junker rising Krasnov&#8217;s forces, joined by
leaders of the Socialist Revolutionaries, did battle with the Reds on
the Pulkovo Heights outside Petrograd. Krasnov was beaten and the
Whites made their way to the south and east. Soviet power still did
not exist in much of the country and the civil war never entirely
died down. Fighting continued throughout the following months,
especially in the Ukraine. Trotsky left his post as Commissar for
Foreign Affairs to become War Commissar in March 1918. This catalogue
of armed resistance to the revolution makes a nonsense of Pipes&#8217;s
claim that &#8216;the Bolshevik terror&#8217; began long &#8216;before any
organised opposition to the Bolsheviks had had a chance to emerge&#8217;.
<a href="#n99" name="f99">[99]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, as most historians admit, the Red Terror did not begin in
earnest until the late summer of 1918. But three months earlier the
Bolsheviks had received a terrible lesson in terror from the Whites
in Finland. Until the October revolution Finland was part of the
Russian Empire, albeit with its own democratic constitution granted
as result of the 1905 revolution. In 1917 Kerensky dissolved the
Finnish parliament when the Social Democratic majority voted for
independence. New elections gave the Social Democrats 92 out of 200
seats, but by now a revolutionary situation was developing. Russia&#8217;s
October revolution was greeted with a general strike in Finland. By
January 1918 a Council of People&#8217;s Delegates had been formed and
red flags flew over the major towns. But White Guards had prepared to
meet this threat and they got the support of German troops. In the
brief civil war that followed the Reds were beaten, but the mass
killings were revenge, committed after the event.</p>

<p>In Helsinki the Whites made workers&#8217; wives and children walk in
front of their troops as they recaptured the city street by street.
One hundred of the women and children died. In all, some 300 corpses
were found in the streets. Later 40 women were laid out on the ice
and shot. In Tavastehus 10,000 prisoners were interned and many died
in the massacre which followed during which &#8216;murder of the wounded
was the norm.&#8217; In Kuumen 500 were shot after the battle and in
Rauma another 500 were shot&#8217;. <a href="#n100" name="f100">[100]</a>
In Sveaborg there were public executions and in Lahti &#8216;in one day
some 200 women were shot with explosive bullets: lumps of flesh were
spattered out in all directions.&#8217; In Viipuri 600 Red Guards were
lined up in three rows and machine gunned to death.&#8217; <a href="#n101" name="f101">[101]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">... from 28 April to 1 June the number of illegal
killings was 4,745, just over half of all such killings, and the peak
period from 5&#8211;11 May saw executions average 200 a day. In total the
illegal killings of captured Reds, or those taken to be such,
totalled 8,380, which included 58 victims under 16, and 364 women.
<a href="#n102" name="f102">[102]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In addition there were another 265 &#8216;legal executions&#8217;, but the
&#8216;formal investigations were perfunctory&#8217; and &#8216;the basis on
which the charges were brought illegal&#8217;. <a href="#n103" name="f103">[103]</a>
Nor was this the end of the White Terror. Some 80,000 were taken
prisoner during May:</p>

<p class="quoteb">they were herded into improvised prisons, often grossly
overcrowded, unsanitary and lacking the most basic facilities ...
nobody on the winning side felt that the food shortages of the
prisoners merited special consideration. <a href="#n104" name="f104">[104]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In four months 11,783 prisoners died of this deliberate neglect.
<a href="#n105" name="f105">[105]</a> In all, the Finnish White
Terror claimed the lives of 23,000 Reds. <a href="#n106" name="f106">[106]</a>
It was a fate which must have burnt itself into the minds of the
Bolsheviks and steeled their hearts during the civil war. Yet neither
Pipes nor Sam Farber can spare as much as a sentence for the White
Terror in Finland.</p>

<p>Imperialist intervention in Russia began to gather pace just as
the White Terror was taking its vengeance on the Finnish workers. It
was designed to exacerbate the economic and political crisis in
Russia to the point where the Bolshevik regime cracked into pieces.
The German occupation of the Ukraine meant that 80 percent of
Russia&#8217;s pre-war grain was now beyond the Bolsheviks&#8217; control.
After the Bolsheviks signed the peace of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918,
a peace which sanctioned the German occupation, they remained in
control of only one seventh of Imperial Russia&#8217;s sugar beet fields
and only one quarter of its coal mines, iron foundries and steel
mills. <a href="#n107" name="f107">[107]</a> And in 1918 the Allied
blockade of Russia began. By the start of the following year &#8216;not one
letter, not one food parcel, not one package of goods, not one
foreign newspaper could enter Red Russia&#8217;. <a href="#n108" name="f108">[108]</a></p>

<p>In April 1918 the British and the Japanese seized Vladivostok in
the east. By the end of the year there were 73,000 Japanese troops,
60,000 Czech troops, 8,000 US troops, 2,500 British troops, 1,500
Italian troops and 1,000 French troops fighting the Reds <em>in
Siberia alone</em>. <a href="#n109" name="f109">[109]</a> During the
course of the civil war the Bolsheviks would face armies from 14
different countries, including all the imperialist powers. From the
east these would support the White forces of Kolchak as they streamed
over the Urals toward Moscow. From the north the British and US
forces supported the Whites as they attempted to thrust south toward
Petrograd. From the south the French and others would support General
Denikin and the Don and Kuban Cossacks as they drove north toward
Moscow. Later the Polish would invade from the east and General
Iudenich would come within a rifle shot of Petrograd. By 1919 more
than 200,000 Allied troops were supporting the Whites. <a href="#n110" name="f110">[110]</a>
Trotsky describes the front in August 1918 as:</p>

<p class="quoteb">a noose that seemed to be closing tighter and tighter
around Moscow ... The soil itself seemed infected with panic ...
everything was crumbling. There was nothing left to hang onto. The
situation seemed hopeless.</p>

<p class="fst">Not for the last time, the Bolsheviks were only in
control of an area &#8216;now reduced to the size of the ancient Moscow
principality. It hardly had an army; it was surrounded by enemies on
all sides&#8217;. <a href="#n111" name="f111">[111]</a></p>

<p>It is often said that war imposes a terrible symmetry on its
opposing sides. This is particularly true of civil war. Trotsky
learnt cavalry tactics from the White Cossacks, just as Cromwell
learnt them from Prince Rupert. And Trotsky, like Cromwell, surpassed
his master. The Russian Civil War, fought in desperate economic
conditions, imposed a particular ferocity on each side. Brutality was
countered by brutality, White Terror by Red Terror. Yet inside the
symmetry of war there was also a vital difference which the war
highlighted: the difference in the class basis of the opposing
armies. White General Krasnov described his own army&#8217;s composition:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Not more than half were fit for combat. The remainder
were priests, nurses, miscellaneous females, officers of the
counter-intelligence services, policemen, aged colonels who had
signed up as commanders of non-existent regiments and, finally,
various &#8216;personalities&#8217;, all of them with a more or less
colourful past, who were in search of positions as governors,
vice-governors, and mayors. <a href="#n112" name="f112">[112]</a></p>

<p class="fst">As General Iudenich&#8217;s troops advanced on Petrograd from the
north &#8216;old officials, old landlords, old policemen were apt to
follow in their wake&#8217;, one observer noted. <a href="#n113" name="f113">[113]</a>
And in the early stages of the civil war when General Denikin
captured Ekaterinodar one Cadet exclaimed, &#8216;There are our
gendarmes, yes, indeed our old, pre-revolutionary gendarmes&#8217;. <a href="#n114" name="f114">[114]</a>
After his retreat from Ekaterinodar, General Denikin found himself in
charge of a force approaching 4,000 of whom 2,368 had been officers,
including 36 generals and 200 colonels. Another 1,036 had been
sergeants or corporals. <a href="#n115" name="f115">[115]</a></p>

<p>The US ambassador to Japan reported that &#8216;the Kolchak government
has failed to command the confidence of anybody in Siberia except a
small discredited group of reactionaries, monarchists and former
military officials&#8217;. This is unsurprising given the Siberian
government&#8217;s view that &#8216;it is impossible to abolish capitalist
forms of industry ... Capitalist forms of industry must exist, and
capitalists as a class must be allowed to direct them&#8217;. <a href="#n116" name="f116">[116]</a>And
of course everywhere and always the arrival of the Whites meant that
the old landlords tried to regain their land and to return to the
age-old rule of the knout.</p>

<p>Given the social composition of the Whites&#8217; leading circles and
the frankly counter-revolutionary programme on which they acted it is
no surprise to find that although terror was used by both sides it
was used most completely, with far greater barbarity, bloodshed and
loss of life by the Whites. This was an absolute necessity for the
Whites since they were unable to win the support of the population
with anything like the success that the Bolsheviks achieved. In those
areas controlled by the Whites the pretence of democratic government,
where it existed in the first place, was quickly abandoned. Both in
the Ukraine and in Siberia the short lived Constituent Assemblies
quickly handed power to military dictatorships. Serge observed:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Point for point, the experience of the Ukraine, where
democratic parties of the middle class could do nothing except open
the path for black reaction, is repeated in Siberia. Such, indeed, is
the inevitable function of these parties in civil wars, since the
peculiarity of the bourgeoisie is to have no politics of its own. It
is always situated between two dictatorships, that of the
proletariat, or that of reaction; its destiny is to prepare the
latter, up to a certain point, and then to submit to it. <a href="#n117" name="f117">[117]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Soon, everywhere that the Whites ruled, dictatorships of a kind
only later rivalled by the Nazis held sway. &#8216;The greater the
terror, the greater our victories,&#8217; declared Kornilov. &#8216;We must
save Russia,&#8217; he argued, &#8216;even if we have to set fire to half of
it and shed the blood of three fourths of all the Russians!&#8217; <a href="#n118" name="f118">[118]</a>
It was clear to the Bolsheviks what such declarations meant from the
time, early in the civil war, when the Whites loaded three freight
cars with corpses and marked them: &#8216;Fresh meat, destination
Petrograd&#8217;. <a href="#n119" name="f119">[119]</a></p>

<p>When the Whites retook Kiev in August 1919, &#8216;anti-Semitic venom
fairly dripped from some of the public pronouncements of Denikin&#8217;s
generals.&#8217; One of these vowed that &#8216;the diabolical force that
lives in the heart of the Jew-Communists will be destroyed&#8217;. <a href="#n120" name="f120">[120]</a>
W. Bruce Lincoln, not a pro-Bolshevik historian, writes that Denikin:</p>

<p class="quoteb">imposed a regime marked by ... a vicious hatred for all
Jews. As the pogroms of 1919 burst upon the Jews of the Ukraine with
an incredible ferocity, the enemies of Bolshevism committed some of
the most brutal acts of persecution in the modern history of the
Western world. <a href="#n121" name="f121">[121]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In these pogroms the &#8216;identification of the Jews with the
Bolsheviks played a central part&#8217;. No longer spontaneous outpourings
of racial and religious hatred, pogroms now became coldly calculated
incidents of wholesale rape, extreme brutality and unprecedented
destruction. In a single day at the end of August in the Jewish
settlement of Kremenchug, the Whites raped 350 women, including
pregnant women, women who had just given birth and even women who
were dying. <a href="#n122" name="f122">[122]</a></p>

<p>In Kiev, the anti-semitic Cadet Shulgin remembers, &#8216;gigantic
five and six storey buildings began to shriek from top to bottom&#8217;.
<a href="#n123" name="f123">[123]</a> In the town of Felshin a third
of the Jewish population perished. In 1919 alone, just in the
Ukraine, the Whites killed 150,000 Jews, a rate only exceeded by the
Nazi Holocaust. One in 13 of the Jewish population of the Ukraine had
been slaughtered. <a href="#n124" name="f124">[124]</a></p>

<p>In Kolchak&#8217;s Siberia the same methods held sway. Even the Cadet
Nikolai Ustrialov described it as &#8216;the darkest, most mindless sort
of military reaction ... the rearguard of a past that is slipping
into eternity&#8217;. <a href="#n125" name="f125">[125]</a> Under
Kolchak&#8217;s jurisdiction was Ataman Semyenov: &#8216;<em>Innocent</em> men
and women dangled by the scores from telegraph poles in the vicinity
of his capital, and his men machine-gunned <em>freight</em> cars full
of victims at execution fields along the railway&#8217;. <a href="#n126" name="f126">[126]</a>
Also fighting alongside Kolchak was Ivan Kalmykov, who Baron <em>Budberg</em>,
one of Kolchak&#8217;s own officials, described as &#8216;a sadistic <em>bandit</em>&#8217;
and &#8216;a fully qualified war criminal&#8217;. By the orders of another
White leader, Baron Urgan-Sternberg, &#8216;men and women suffered death
by beating, hanging, beheading, disembowelling and countless other
tortures which transformed them from living human beings into what
one witness called a &#8220;formless bloody mass&#8221;.&#8217; Even his own
staff physician described one of the Baron&#8217;s written orders as &#8216;the
product of the diseased brain of a pervert and a megalomaniac
affected with a thirst for human blood&#8217;. <a href="#n127" name="f127">[127]</a>
Admiral Kolchak himself, when some members of the executive of his
government suggested there should be some reforms, &#8216;pounded the
table with his fists, flung everything on the floor, seized a
penknife, and angrily slashed the arms of the chair&#8217; before replying:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Leave me in peace. I forbid you to bring up such
questions. Today I am going to the council of ministers and will
order that ... there will be <em>absolutely</em> no reforms. <a href="#n128" name="f128">[128]</a></p>

<p class="fst">For the troops of Kuban Cossack General Shkuro, a conservative
historian has written, &#8216;the chief inducement offered them was loot,
for Shkuro was not particular where he looted or how ... if he had to
kill people he preferred that they should be Bolsheviks&#8217;. <a href="#n129" name="f129">[129]</a>
Meanwhile, also in the Kuban:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Cadets ... looked on while reactionary General Dragomirov
began the persecution of Jews that would turn into full-fledged
pogroms ... and the sadistic General Pokrovski hanged socialists <em>en
masse</em> in the courtyard outside his window &#8216;to improve the
appetite&#8217;. <a href="#n130" name="f130">[130]</a></p>

<p class="fst">General Mai-Maevsky, a veteran of Denikin&#8217;s army, &#8216;was capable
of the greatest cruelty, and had a penchant for orgies&#8217;. <a href="#n131" name="f131">[131]</a>
Denikin&#8217;s successor, Wrangel, describes one of his own senior
officers, General Slaschev, as &#8216;thoroughly addicted to narcotics
and alcohol&#8217;. On visiting Slaschev&#8217;s quarters Wrangel found him
sprawled in a jumble of liquor bottles wearing a fantastical uniform
made from a long white Turkish robe trimmed with gold and fur. There
was&#8217;, Wrangel says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">a crane and a raven, a swallow and also a starling ...
fluttering here and there and perching on their master&#8217;s head and
shoulders ... I was dealing with a man completely overcome with
mental illness. <a href="#n132" name="f132">[132]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The whole existence of the White camp &#8211; its social composition,
its policies, its methods and the character of its leading figures &#8211;
is utterly at odds with the social profile of the Reds. Unless these
vital differences are understood it becomes impossible to explain how
the Bolsheviks won the civil war. Again and again we find that even
the Whites themselves admit the vital difference between their regime
and the Reds. An official report to Kolchak&#8217;s War Ministry,
detailing the state of one of its armies in 1919, says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Ataman Krasilnikov is completely inactive, devotes
himself exclusively to drinking and disorderly conduct; his officers
act in the same way: the soldiers carry out arbitrary searches with
the purpose of robbery and violate women. The whole population is
eager for Bolshevism. The situation is critical. <a href="#n133" name="f133">[133]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In Siberia, reported US General Graves, &#8216;the word Bolshevik
meant a human being who did not ... give encouragement to the
restoration to power ... of autocracy in Russia.&#8217; He went on to
assert that &#8216;outside the office holding and military class, the
Omsk [Kolchak] government had less than 1 percent of followers&#8217;.
<a href="#n134" name="f134">[134]</a> The Cadet Ustrialov reported
that in Omsk the &#8216;poor openly rejoice and wait for the Bolsheviks
to arrive&#8217;. <a href="#n135" name="f135">[135]</a></p>

<p>It was more or less the same story in other White areas. In the
Northern territory, the SR Boris Sokolov records, &#8216;the sentiment of
the population of Archangel and of the villages have convinced me
that the majority of the population is in sympathy with the
Bolsheviki&#8217;. <a href="#n136" name="f136">[136]</a> Another
supporter of the northern White government admitted that &#8216;the mass
of the people is turning back to Bolshevism&#8217;. <a href="#n137" name="f137">[137]</a>
And of Denikin&#8217;s regime in the south, Chamberlin says:</p>

<p class="quoteb">With all its shortcomings, the Soviet regime was popular
with the masses of the <em>inogorodni</em> [outlanders, non-Cossack
peasants with limited rights], who feared, with good reason, that the
return to power of the Cossack Rada [parliament] would mean not only
the end of their dreams of confiscating some of the more abundant
possessions of the Cossacks, but also a period of very sanguinary
revenge and repression. <a href="#n138" name="f138">[138]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Denikin himself describes his own governors:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In psychology, world outlook and habits they were so
alien to the upheaval that had taken place that they could neither
understand it nor deal with it. For them everything was in the past
and they attempted to resurrect this past inform and spirit. After
them followed the minor agents of the old regime, some of them
terrified by the Revolution, others embittered and revengeful. <a href="#n139" name="f139">[139]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Chamberlin acknowledges that in the last instance it was Denikin&#8217;s
lack of popular support &#8216;which was the fundamental cause of the
defeat of the Whites&#8217;. <a href="#n140" name="f140">[140]</a></p>

<p>Besides the different attitude of the Bolsheviks to the workers
and the peasants there was another vital difference with the social
policy of the Whites which helped ensure a Red victory: the attitude
to the rights of nations to self-determination. The Whites of course
were unremittingly hostile to any such right. Their constantly
proclaimed slogan was, &#8216;Russia shall be Great, United and
Undivided.&#8217; The great Russian chauvinism of the Whites made it
inevitable that they should take such a position, despite the fact
that it was to prove fatal to their cause.</p>

<p>In the north west &#8216;the stubborn unwillingness of the Whites,
obsessed with the idea of a &#8220;great undivided Russia&#8221;, to
recognise the independence of Finland and Estonia, the cooperation of
which would have been very desirable in operations against Petrograd,
was a not inconsiderable cause of their defeat&#8217;. <a href="#n141" name="f141">[141]</a></p>

<p>The White army of western Russia, headed by General Count Rudiger
von der Goltz, was:</p>

<p class="quoteb">notorious for its brutal treatment of Latvians, Estonians
and Bolsheviks. Called by some the &#8216;vanguard of Nazism&#8217; the
Freikorps units ... instituted what one British diplomat called a
&#8216;veritable reign of terror&#8217; that claimed the lives of some 3,000
Latvians in Riga alone. <a href="#n142" name="f142">[142]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the south:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It was Denikin&#8217;s misfortune that much of the population
in the territory under his control was non-Russian and that his
prospects of military victory depended very much on his ability to
conciliate Ukrainians and Poles, Georgians and Caucasian tribesmen; a
task for which he was completely unfitted ... <a href="#n143" name="f143">[143]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In fact Denikin forbade teaching of the Ukrainian language. With
such disaffection among the population of the White areas it is
little surprise to find that a similar attitude often developed among
the rank and file of the White armies, whether they were indigenous
Russians or foreign interventionists. Of course there were many cases
of desertion and passing over to the Whites in the Red Army. But the
scale was greater among the White troops. In north Russia in 1919
nearly half of the White troops, some 6,000 men, went over to the
Reds in two weeks when their commander gave them the choice. Whole
regiments went over en masse. At about the same time British and
French units in the area mutinied and one US sergeant recorded in his diary:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The majority of people here are in sympathy with the Bolo
[i.e. Bolsheviks]. I don&#8217;t blame them, in fact I am nine tenths
Bolo myself. <a href="#n144" name="f144">[144]</a></p>

<p class="fst">One Red officer, risking his life, deserted to Kolchak. But he was
so disgusted at the all pervasive indiscipline and debauchery that he
drew a sharp comparison with the Red Army where, he said, an
intoxicated officer would have been shot by the first commissar who
met him. Chamberlin concludes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Not all the Communists, certainly, were saints or
puritans. But their general behaviour and morale seem to have been
better than those of their opponents. <a href="#n145" name="f145">[145]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Towards the end of the Kolchak regime, even the dictator&#8217;s
personal bodyguards drew the same conclusion: when Kolchak gave them
a free choice about whether they should continue to follow him or
join the Bolsheviks, &#8216;almost to a man, the men in whose loyalty he
had believed absolutely repaid his trust by joining the Bolsheviks&#8217;.
<a href="#n146" name="f146">[146]</a> Such was the decomposition of
the White camp at the end of the civil war. But in order to achieve
this victory the Bolsheviks had to make, and had to demand that the
mass of peasants and workers make, the most costly of sacrifices.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>War Communism and the Red Terror</h4>

<p class="fst">In 1918 the economic wreckage in the country, the constant
pressure of foreign intervention and blockade and the terrifying
ferocity of the White Terror meant that the sacrifices necessary to
win the civil war would not be made, or could not be made in time,
simply through the normal methods of political debate.</p>

<p>When SRs assassinated leading Bolsheviks simply to rely on
political re-education to convince them of their error was an act of
suicide. While the Whites held a gun to the peasant&#8217;s head and a
bayonet to his child&#8217;s throat no amount of political propaganda
alone would convince the peasant to defy the Whites. When the
imperialist armies pressed towards Moscow conscription was a
necessity since there simply was not the time for a disciplined,
extensive, fully politically conscious, armed population to have been
organised to meet them. Ten years breathing space could have created
such an armed population, but the Bolsheviks&#8217; time scale was
measured in weeks. When the cities starved it would have been better
to bring the peasant to give grain to the regime in return for the
far greater gift of machinery but for that revolution in Germany, or
at least the revival of industry, was necessary. In the absence of
both all that stood between the workers&#8217; state and its destruction
at the hands of Kolchak and Denikin was grain requisitioning.</p>

<p>This dialectic of consent and coercion is, of course, an aspect of
any workers&#8217; revolution. More than 30 years ago Tony Cliff put it
like this:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Under capitalism discipline confronts that worker as an
external coercive power, which capital has over him. Under socialism
discipline will be the result of consciousness, it will become the
habit of free people. In the transition period it will be the outcome
of the two elements consciousness and coercion. Collective ownership
of the means of production by the workers, i.e. the ownership by the
workers&#8217; state of the means of production, will be the basis for
the conscious element in labour discipline. At the same time the
working class as a collective, through its institutions &#8211; soviets,
trade unions, etc &#8211; will appear as a coercive power as regards the
disciplining of the individual workers in production.</p>

<p class="quote">This conflict between the individual and the collective,
the necessity of uniting conviction with its ugly opposite, coercion,
the compulsion on the working class to use barbaric methods remaining
from capitalism to fight capitalist barbarism, is but another
affirmation that the workers are not liberated spiritually under
capitalism, and would take a whole historical period to grow to full
human stature. <a href="#n147" name="f147">[147]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In a country where the working class was a minority of the
population, where industry had been battered by years of war and in
conditions of White and imperialist encirclement, the balance
gradually tilted towards greater coercion. Each step of the way was
forced on the Bolsheviks by dire and pressing necessities. Every
element of coercion was an emergency measure adopted for the simple
reason that the only other alternative was the triumph of
counter-revolution. It was the realisation of this fact which ensured
that even while many workers and peasants bridled under the regime of
War Communism they fought to the death to defend it from the Whites.
It is also why the most draconian forms of coercion intertwined with
the most conspicuous acts of heroism in every aspect of the War
Communist regime.</p>

<p>In the economic field the Bolsheviks&#8217; immediate steps after the
October revolution were modest. They did not want wholesale
nationalisation and were content to gradually try and regularise a
situation where the workers&#8217; control in the factory coerced and
cajoled the existing owners. As S.A. Smith writes in <strong>Red
Petrograd</strong>, his detailed study of workers&#8217; control in the factories:</p>

<p class="quoteb">This awkward fact makes a nonsense of the claim in
Western historiography that, once power was in his grasp, Lenin, the
stop-at-nothing centraliser, proceeded to crush the &#8216;syndicalist&#8217;
factory committees. <a href="#n148" name="f148">[148]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Of course the fact that workers now controlled the state machine
meant that they had a powerful tool with which to circumscribe the
limits within which the jostling development of mixed companies would
take place. The local factory committees were the first to call for
the power of the workers&#8217; state to be used to structure industry.
They above all realised that workers&#8217; control in the factory <em>must</em>
be complemented by workers&#8217; control over the whole economy.
Indeed immediately after the revolution the All Russian Council of
Factory Committees passed a decree which demanded a central apparatus
to regulate the economy &#8211; it was Lenin&#8217;s decree on workers&#8217;
control which toned down this demand. <a href="#n149" name="f149">[149]</a></p>

<p>A similar urge to put an end to the anarchy which prevailed as a
result of competition between different labour organisations can be
seen in the debate on the role of trade unions. The absorption of the
factory committees by the trade unions is often portrayed as a
Bolshevik plot to undermine the committees. In fact it was a part of
the desire of rank and file militants to rationalise the mass of
organisations that had sprouted during the revolution and to overcome
the inherent localism of the committees. At the First All Russian
Congress of Trade Unions there were only six votes against merging
the committees with the unions. Both the Bolsheviks and the
Mensheviks vote for merger. <a href="#n150" name="f150">[150]</a> And the
Petrograd factory committees, at their sixth and final conference in
January 1918, agreed to merger. Their incorporation into the unions
helped to broaden the functions of the unions, giving them a role in
supervising production as part of a committee in each factory. <a href="#n151" name="f151">[151]</a></p>

<p>All these are perfectly healthy debates about how a workers&#8217;
state is to organise its economy. At this point the economic
structure is still a long way from the wholesale state control which
was rapidly to be forced on the regime. The need for a breathing
space, for the revolution to gather its forces, was at the heart of
this strategy of state regulated capitalism which Lenin advocated
immediately after the revolution. Two overwhelmingly powerful forces
obliged the Bolsheviks to abandon this &#8216;reformist&#8217; course.</p>

<p>One was the fact that the capitalists used their remaining power
to make the system unworkable. At the end of 1917 the All Russian
Congress of Employers declared that those &#8216;factories in which the
control is exercised by means of active interference in the
administration will be closed&#8217;. <a href="#n152" name="f152">[152]</a>
The workers&#8217; natural response to the wave of lockouts which
followed was to demand that their state nationalise the factories. So
it was that, of all the individual firms nationalised by July 1918,
only one fifth had been nationalised on the initiative of the state
while four fifths had been nationalised on the initiative of local
committees. <a href="#n153" name="f153">[153]</a> But the power of
the Russian capitalists alone would not have been sufficient to blow
the regime off course if it had not been for a second factor: the
start of the civil war and the allied intervention. One economic
historian explains the impact of the armed threat:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In the atmosphere of the kindling civil war every joint
effort of capital and the proletarian dictatorship (workers&#8217;
control, mixed joint stock companies etc.) is seen to be a quickly
evaporating Utopia. The intervention of world capital, which fanned
the expiring counter-revolutionary resistance within Russia into a
new blaze, forced its consequences onto the proletariat the
inexorable expropriation of large scale capital and capital
generally, the confiscation of the property of the ruling classes,
the suppression of the market and the construction of an
all-embracing proletarian organisation of political economy, which
depended on overcoming the market, and its exploitation. <a href="#n154" name="f154">[154]</a></p>

<p class="fst">So, far from being an example of inherently undemocratic Bolshevik
politics, as Sam Farber and others maintain, the nationalisations of
War Communism were an <em>ad hoc</em> measure which sharply departed
from the far slower, more measured path that the Bolsheviks would
have preferred to tread. In fact the nationalisation of all heavy
industry and joint stock companies in June 1918 was a hastily
prepared measure designed to circumvent the condition of the
Brest-Litovsk treaty which required compensation to be paid to German
investors whose firms were not nationalised by 1 July. <a href="#n155" name="f155">[155]</a>
Bruce Lincoln summarises the work of the Bolsheviks&#8217; Supreme
Council of National Economy as &#8216;reflecting little coherent
planning&#8217;. Its decisions were only internally generated in a
minority of cases:</p>

<p class="quoteb">far more often the Supreme Council worked to prevent
factories being shut down by anti-Bolshevik managers or to offset
crudely conceived local seizures ... At best the Supreme Council&#8217;s
first attempts to nationalise Russia&#8217;s industries reflected the
Bolsheviks&#8217; overwhelming concern for self-defence and survival.
<a href="#n156" name="f156">[156]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Bolshevik leader Milyutin wrote, &#8216;The process of
nationalisation went on from below, and the soviet leaders could not
keep up with it, could not take things in hand, in spite of the fact
that many orders were issued which forbade local organisations to
enact nationalisations by themselves&#8217;. <a href="#n157" name="f157">[157]</a>
Lenin recognised the enormous strain that the nationalisation policy
was placing on the workers&#8217; state. In April 1918 he declared, &#8216;If
we go on expropriating capital at this rate, we shall infallibly be
beaten&#8217;. <a href="#n158" name="f158">[158]</a></p>

<p>Yet the harder the Whites and the imperialists pressed on the
regime, the more unavoidable a siege economy became. With the civil
war came the need for stricter labour discipline and for the
committees which ran the factories to be replaced by &#8216;one man
management&#8217;. Both these processes developed in lock step with the
war. In 1919 only 10.8 percent of firms in Russia were under one man
management. This figure rose swiftly during the following year. But
even so, in Petrograd in 1920, only 31 percent of factories employing
more than 200 were under one man management. <a href="#n159" name="f159">[159]</a>
Labour discipline also tightened during the civil war, but as S.A.
Smith records:</p>

<p class="quoteb">During 1918 the desire to transform relations of
authority within the enterprise gave way to the drive for greater
productivity ... Yet one cannot see in this a triumph of the
Bolshevik Party over the factory committees. From the first, the
committees had been committed both to maintaining production and to
democratising factory life, but the condition of industry was such
that these two objectives now conflicted with one another. The
factory committees, in general, consented to the prioritisation of
productivity: they acquiesced in, and even initiated, impulses toward
stricter labour discipline. <a href="#n160" name="f160">[160]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In the towns and cities workers accepted, albeit not happily, the
rigours of War Communism as necessary to defend the revolution. But
beyond the towns the peasants were a different problem. In the
country food requisitioning &#8211; the taking of the peasants&#8217; grain,
often by force &#8211; became essential to ward off the spectre of
starvation. Food requisitioning was an act of desperation not, as Sam
Farber argues, a dogmatic attempt to &#8216;suppress the market&#8217;. The
Bolsheviks would far rather have avoided it, if for no other reason
than it threatened to split the alliance between the workers and the
peasants on which the whole edifice of the state rested. As Tsiurupa,
the People&#8217;s Commissar of Food Supplies, put it:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There are only two possibilities, either we perish from
hunger, or we weaken the [peasant economy] to some extent, but
[manage to] get out of our temporary difficulties. <a href="#n161" name="f161">[161]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Bolsheviks would have preferred the solution to the peasant
question opened up by the perspective of permanent revolution: to use
the industrial strength of the cities to improve the productivity of
the peasants and wed them to the rule of the working class. This was
also the plea from the peasants, encapsulated by peasant delegates at
the Eighth Congress of Soviets in 1920:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;If you want us to sow all the land ... just give us
salt and iron. I shall not say anything more.&#8217; We need horses,
wheels, harrows, other voices chimed in. Give us metal to mend our
tools and sheds. <a href="#n162" name="f162">[162]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was a simple request, but under the conditions of civil war and
without revolution in Europe it was a request which the Bolsheviks
could not satisfy.The only other alternative was to take grain by
sending out requisitioning and roadblock units from the towns. The
cry for grain came from the towns and cities, as the desperate
telegrams flooding into the People&#8217;s Commissariat for Food Supply
in 1918 testify:</p>

<p class="quoteb">WE HAVE NO BREAD. THE SITUATION IS HOPELESS. HUNGER
REIGNS. &#8211; 19 May, from the village of Pokrov.</p>

<p class="quoteb">IAROSLAV PROVINCE IS IN AN ABSOLUTELY UNPRECEDENTED
IMPOVERISHED AND CATASTROPHIC CONDITION SO FAR AS FOOD SUPPLIES ARE
CONCERNED. ABSOLUTELY NO SHIPMENTS OF GRAIN HAVE ARRIVED FOR TWO
WEEKS. &#8211; 24 May, from the provincial capital of Iaroslav.</p>

<p class="quoteb">STARVING WORKERS ARE COLLAPSING AT THEIR MACHINES ... WE
BEG YOU TO SEND US BREAD ... THIS IS NOT A THREAT BUT A FINAL CRY OF
DESPAIR. &#8211; 25 May, from the town of Vyksa. <a href="#n163" name="f163">[163]</a></p>

<p class="fst">There can be no better testimony to the desperation that lay
behind this policy than Lenin&#8217;s call of July 1918 when he urged the
workers of Petrograd to go &#8216;in their tens of thousands to the
Urals, the Volga and the south&#8217;, insisting that it was &#8216;criminal&#8217;
and &#8216;stupid&#8217; to sit and starve in empty factories. It was a
galling necessity that the very class base of the revolution had to
be consciously dispersed in order to avoid death by starvation. By
September 1918 the Petrograd labour force had fallen to just below 30
percent of its 1917 figure. <a href="#n164" name="f164">[164]</a> It
was a high risk policy. The countryside was aflame with peasant
revolts and the food detachments were likely to be ambushed and
killed. But as one official of the Food Commissariat exclaimed:</p>

<p class="quoteb">What do you think, the People&#8217;s Commissariat of Food
Supply does this for its own satisfaction? No, we do it because there
is not enough food. <a href="#n165" name="f165">[165]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The grain was certainly there: &#8216;Kulak [rich peasant] storehouses
in the Bolsheviks&#8217; shrunken domains at midsummer [1918] still
contained three quarters of a million tons of grain from the 1917
harvest plus a great deal more from earlier years&#8217;. <a href="#n166" name="f166">[166]</a></p>

<p>To make the requisitioning policy work it was also necessary to
highlight the difference between the village poor and the richer
peasants. The former were more likely to stand by the workers than
were the latter. In the short run the Committees of Poor Peasants
organised by the Bolsheviks split the united front of the village
into two hostile camps and therefore aided the food detachments. But
ultimately they fell victim to the success of the Bolsheviks&#8217;
redistribution of the land. This reduced the number of very wealthy
peasants <em>and</em> the number of poor peasants, thus recomposing the
united front of the peasantry. By the end of the civil war the policy
of requisitioning was worn threadbare: the New Economic Policy was a
recognition that the relations between the peasantry and the workers&#8217;
state had to find a new footing.</p>

<p>Both wholesale nationalisation and requisitioning were retreats
forced on the Bolsheviks by circumstance. It is part of the
Bolsheviks&#8217; achievement that they recognised the necessity and met
it face to face. Occasionally, however, they were inclined to make a
virtue of necessity, to claim that the harsh measures of the civil
war were the epitome of socialism. This is in part understandable;
any policy must have a rhetorical power if its necessity is to be
understood by millions. But what is required of historians,
particularly Marxists, is to separate phrase from substance. Yet this
is precisely what Sam Farber and Robin Blackburn fail to do. Instead
they take Lenin or Trotsky&#8217;s shouts of command in the midst of
battle and portray them as considered analyses of events.</p>

<p>The Red Army, more than any other institution of the civil war
years, embodied the contradiction between the political consciousness
and circumstantial coercion. On the one hand the creation of the Red
Army was a retreat: it was a conscripted, not a voluntary, army;
officers were appointed not elected; old Tsarist officers were
appointed by the thousand; there was severe military discipline,
including execution; there was desertion and atrocities, sometimes
committed by whole units. But the Red Army was also filled with a
magnificent socialist consciousness. Conscription may have been
necessary to build a mass army in a peasant country, but it was the
most active and class conscious workers (above all the Bolsheviks)
who volunteered again and again for the most dangerous tasks. In 1919
thousands deserted the party rather than fight Denikin, but thousands
more joined during &#8216;party weeks&#8217; when, as the Central Committee
bulletin put it, &#8216;to get out a party card in such conditions,
signified, to a certain extent, becoming a candidate for Denikin&#8217;s
gallows. &#8216;In the 1920 dash towards Warsaw the Red Army lost 33
percent of its force in casualties &#8211; but some 90 percent of the
army&#8217;s &#8216;hardened Bolsheviks&#8217; lost their lives. <a href="#n167" name="f167">[167]</a></p>

<p>Red Army discipline was harsh, but it was harshest of all for the
officers and commissars. Ordinary soldiers who returned to the Red
Army after desertion would often be sworn back in; the commissars of
units that deserted were frequently shot. For the White Cossack
cavalry looting, rape and murder were a way of life. Looting was
forbidden in the Red Army. Anti-Semitism and pogroms were rife in the
White armies; anti-Semitic publications were banned in the Red Army.
Pogromists were shot. In the Ukraine whole Jewish communities lived
behind the Red Army lines, advancing when it advanced, retreating
when it retreated. Who can imagine the White Army reproducing the
literacy and educational groups of the Red Army? Who can see the
White Cossacks putting letter boards on the backs of the first rank
of cavalry so that those behind could learn to read as they were on
the march? And who can see the White Army producing anything like
this Red Army marching song:</p>

<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" align="center">

<p class="quoteb">Two days of study, then a week in battle,<br/>
Two days with pencils, a week with bayonets. <a href="#n168" name="f168">[168]</a></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="fst">The differences between the two armies were not lost on the
peasants. In the south they nicknamed the White Army the
&#8216;Grabarmiia&#8217;, the looting army. In both the south and east the
population came to prefer the regular exactions of the Reds to the
riotous pillaging of the Whites. The difference in the class
programme of the Whites and Reds decisively affected both the support
which the population gave to each side and the morale of the Red and
White armies. Many peasants certainly resented the grain
requisitioning policies of the Bolsheviks and they often rose in
revolt against them &#8211; but they did not hate requisitioning as
deeply as they hated the idea that the land itself would be
repossessed by the old landlords. Red troops certainly carried out
atrocities, but they were not the <em>policy</em> of the Red commanders
as they were of the Whites. The Bolsheviks&#8217; social policy gave
other grounds for winning the trust of workers and peasants whereas
the Whites had to rely on force alone. The Red Terror was certainly
brutal, but unlike the White Terror it was not directed against the
mass of workers and peasants in the name of a tiny and discredited
old order. In the cities the Reds enjoyed the fierce and virtually
undivided loyalty of the masses throughout the civil war period.</p>

<p>If the Red Army typified the contradictions of the civil war, the
Red Terror pushed those contradictions to extremes. Of course any
workers&#8217; revolution would need force to subdue
counter-revolutionary risings and sabotage carried out by the old
capitalist class and the remnants of its state. It was against these
people that the Red Terror was directed in the first instance. As
Chamberlin observes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">White Russia also had its terror, its all-pervading
espionage, its frequent executions, its crowded prisons. The chief
difference was in the types of people whom one would have found in
the prisons of Moscow and Petrograd, on the one side, and of Omsk and
Rostov on the other. The Cheka directed its raids mainly against the
wealthy and the middle classes. The White police rounded up more
workers and people of the poorer classes. <a href="#n169" name="f169">[169]</a></p>

<p class="fst">One immediate cause of the Red Terror was the various
counter-revolutionary plots mounted by Russian Whites and supported
by the imperialist powers. R.H. Bruce Lockhart, the British
diplomatic representative in Moscow, for instance, had been
instrumental in ensuring that Kerensky escaped from Russia after his
unsuccessful military attempt to unseat the Bolsheviks. Bruce
Lockhart was also, by his own admission, passing money to
anti-Bolshevik groups. Sidney Reilly, a British intelligence agent, was
trying, unsuccessfully, to convince Lockhart that he &#8216;might be able
to stage a counter-revolution in Moscow&#8217;. <a href="#n170" name="f170">[170]</a>
But, according to Reilly, one part of his plan was prematurely put
into effect in August 1918: Socialist Revolutionary Fanny Kaplan shot
Lenin twice at point blank range, bringing him close to death.
Earlier Reilly had managed to establish himself as a Soviet official
with access to documents from Trotsky&#8217;s Foreign Ministry. And
another British agent, George Hill, became a military adviser to
Trotsky. <a href="#n171" name="f171">[171]</a> Overall, the British
secret service:</p>

<p class="quoteb">devoted the largest single part of its budget to Russia
... It sent its best agents fluent Russian speakers with a long
experience of the country and its people to Moscow and Petrograd with
a virtually free hand to establish networks, finance
counter-revolutionaries, and to do all in their power to crush the
Bolshevik menace in its infancy. <a href="#n172" name="f172">[172]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But the Red Terror also ran beyond these groups. The ultimate
cause of the <em>extent</em> of Red Terror lies, once again, in the
isolation of the Russian working class. The sea of peasants were the
element in which the counter-revolution swam. The SRs, who claimed to
represent the peasantry, were the foremost promoters of
counter-revolution behind Red lines. And it was the poverty of the
revolution which obliged it to use force rather than finance against
the peasants who hoarded grain in the countryside.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviks were faced with attempts at assassination and
counter-revolution such as those mounted by the (SR supported)
military cadets, two days after they had been released on parole
following their capture in the Winter Palace, and by the SRs at the
time of the dispersion of the Constituent Assembly. Lenin never tried
to hide or disguise the fact that the revolution would have to use
terror, up to and including shooting people. In the struggle between
revolution and counter-revolution people on both sides were willing
to die for their cause: prison, let alone parole, would not deter
many counter-revolutionaries:</p>

<p class="quoteb">How can one make a revolution without firing squads? Do
you think you will be able to deal with your enemies by laying down
your arms? What other means of repression do you have? Imprisonment?
No one attaches any importance to this during a civil war when each
side hopes to win. <a href="#n173" name="f173">[173]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In this Lenin was following the example of the French Revolution
which, also under the impact of foreign invasion and
counter-revolutionary pressure from the peasantry, used terror to
ensure its existence during its darkest hour. And in 1848 Marx, in
reaction to &#8216;the cannibalism of the counter-revolution&#8217;, argued
that there was &#8216;only one means to curtail, simplify and localise
the bloody agony of the old society and the birth pangs of the new,
only one means the &#8211; revolutionary terror&#8217;. <a href="#n174" name="f174">[174]</a></p>

<p>In December 1917 the Soviet formed the All-Russian Extraordinary
Commission to fight Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, known by its
Russian acronym as the Cheka or Vecheka. The Cheka was only one
element in the Red Terror, and not necessarily the most important
part. The Red Army, the grain requisitioning and road block
detachments were more important. Neither was the Cheka a specifically
Bolshevik proposal. It grew out of a number of investigative
commissions of the Soviet and out of the Military Revolutionary
Committee of the Soviet which had carried out the insurrection.
George Leggett, the intensely right wing historian of the Cheka, records:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There is no direct evidence that the Bolshevik Party ...
played any part in the creation of the Vecheka; perhaps this is
indicative of the relative lack of importance attached at that moment
to the hasty improvisation of yet another investigative commission. <a href="#n175" name="f175">[175]</a></p>

<p class="fst">It was a common understanding among all those in the revolutionary
camp that the revolutionary terror was necessary, although they might
argue about specific measures. The formation of the Cheka was quite
open: it was announced in the Soviet&#8217;s newspaper, <strong>Izvestia</strong>,
along with its office address, its opening hours and an appeal to the
public to help combat counter-revolution. For a period it produced
the <strong>Vecheka Weekly Bulletin</strong> in which the commission&#8217;s
activities, including the names of those it shot, were publicly
discussed. Bruce Lockhart was taken on the Cheka&#8217;s first raid as a
public witness. <a href="#n176" name="f176">[176]</a> In its early
days the Cheka had a small staff and its head, the Bolshevik Felix
Dzerzhinsky, could carry all its files around in his briefcase. <a href="#n177" name="f177">[177]</a></p>
<p>The Left Socialist Revolutionaries played a prominent role in the
Cheka both during and after their time as part of the Soviet
government they left the government in March 1918 in protest at the
Brest-Litovsk treaty. But it was the actions of the LSRs, alongside
the worsening civil war and the mounting imperialist intervention,
that precipitated a sharpening of the Red Terror.</p>

<p>The spring and summer of 1918 was a time of crisis for the
workers&#8217; state. In April, as we have seen, the White Terror began
in Finland. The Germans occupied the Ukraine following the
Brest-Litovsk treaty. Some 200 Kulak revolts flared through the
countryside. In June People&#8217;s Commissar Volodarsky was murdered. In
August Uritsky, the head of the Petrograd Cheka, was killed by a
Socialist Revolutionary. In the midst of this crisis, in July 1918,
the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets met. The LSRs chose this
moment to announce that their opposition to the Brest-Litovsk treaty
was now going to take the form of armed conflict with the Bolsheviks.
Their leader, Maria Spiridonova, appeared at the Congress and
announced the party&#8217;s return to its terrorist traditions with the
instruction to &#8216;take up the revolver and the hand grenade&#8217;. The
next day she followed her own advice and appeared at the Congress
brandishing a Browning and crying &#8216;Long live the revolt!&#8217;. <a href="#n178" name="f178">[178]</a></p>

<p>The LSR revolt took place simultaneously in Iaroslav and other
towns. It coincided with the revolt of the commander of the eastern
front at Simbirsk. In Moscow the LSRs used their base in the Cheka to
execute their plans. Iakov Bliumkin, the LSR head of Cheka
counter-espionage, forged Dzerzhinsky&#8217;s signature on a pass, gained
access to the German diplomatic representative in Moscow and shot
him, hoping to smash the Brest-Litovsk treaty and provoke a new war
with Germany. Bliumkin then fled to the barracks of the Cheka Combat
Detachment, who were sympathetic to the LSRs. When Dzerzhinsky, with
great heroism but not much tactical sense, arrived and demanded that
Bliumkin be handed over, the commander arrested Dzerzhinsky. Another
Bolshevik Cheka leader, Latsis, was arrested by the LSRs <em>inside</em>
the Cheka head office.</p>

<p>The day after Uritsky was murdered, Lenin was shot by Socialist
Revolutionary Fanny Kaplan. Although he was seriously wounded he
couldn&#8217;t be taken to hospital for fear that the surgeon would have
LSR sympathies. Lenin recovered and the LSR revolt was suppressed,
but the siege atmosphere in the revolutionary camp was heightened.
Spiridonova, who claimed full responsibility for the revolt, was
given a one year jail sentence and an immediate amnesty because of
her previous &#8216;services to the revolution&#8217;. Elsewhere the Red
Terror reached a peak of ferocity. In Kronstadt the sailors and the
Cheka killed 400 in a single night. In Iaroslavl, one of the seats of
revolt, 200 were killed. On a single day, 3 October, 200 killings
were reported in various parts of the country. Although Lenin was
wholeheartedly in favour of the terror, he tried to limit the
ferocity which resulted from the anger over the LSR revolt and the
attempt on his life. Bruce Lockhart himself records that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The whole situation seemed hopeless until Lenin was able
to take a hand in affairs. After he recovered consciousness, his
first remark, it was said, was &#8216;Stop the Terror&#8217;. <a href="#n179" name="f179">[179]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Certainly the terror rarely assumed the popular, nationwide
intensity that it reached in the period after the attempt on Lenin&#8217;s
life. Yet it is from this period that many right wing historians draw
their most lurid stories of Cheka atrocities. Let us examine three
which frequently recur. The first concerns the question of torture. A
letter from a provincial branch of the Cheka, published in the Cheka
paper in October 1918, demands to know, &#8216;Why are you so soft?&#8217;
Referring to the arrest of Bruce Lockhart it demands that he should
be subject to &#8216;the most refined tortures&#8217; and then sent to &#8216;the
other world&#8217;. <a href="#n180" name="f180">[180]</a> We are less
frequently told that the <em>Bolshevik</em> Central Committee
immediately upbraided the editorial board and closed the bulletin and
that the Soviet, while defending the terror, renewed its condemnation
of torture. <a href="#n181" name="f181">[181]</a></p>

<p>The point is not that units of the Cheka never used torture,
although the most extreme examples (scalping of victims, driving rats
down a heated pipe held against the victim&#8217;s stomach until the rat
gnawed its way through the flesh) come almost exclusively from White
literature &#8211; Denikin&#8217;s Commission on the Cheka and RSR leader
Chernov&#8217;s materials as even Leggett admits. <a href="#n182" name="f182">[182]</a>
The point is that the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet
and the Cheka itself tried to stamp it out whenever it became known.
Soviet law forbade torture. Lenin defended the terror and the Cheka,
but he was ruthless in punishing any abuse of its power:</p>

<p class="quoteb">He was concerned to establish, in each case that came to
his attention, whether the arrest had been necessary on purely
pragmatic security grounds. Why had the Kotelnichi Cheka arrested the
teacher Lubnin? Why had the Vecheka not released Kiril Semenovich
Ginsburg, despite assurances given by two party members? Why had the
Samara Provincial Cheka arrested the members of an expedition of
irrigation experts to Turkestan? Had the food confiscation
detachments and the Cavrilovo-Posadnaia Cheka acted correctly in
confiscating grain? Could not Viktor Ivanovich Dobrovolskii, under
arrest in Petrograd, be released? He was said to be ill, apolitical,
and his family&#8217;s only breadwinner ... On 20 May 1919 Lenin
telegraphed to the Novgorod Soviet, with a copy to the local Cheka:
It appears that Bulatov was arrested for putting a complaint to me. I
warn you that for this I shall arrest the chairman of the Cheka and
the chairman and members of executive committee, and I shall press
for their execution. Why did you not reply at the time to my enquiry?
<a href="#n183" name="f183">[183]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The second issue is the prison regime under the Red Terror. It is
a standard claim of the right wing, perhaps most famously made in
Solzhenitsyn&#8217;s <strong>The Gulag Archipelago</strong>, that the prisons and
concentration camps of War Communism led directly to the gulag of
Stalin&#8217;s day. The first and most obvious objection to this is the
question of numbers: under Stalin <em>millions</em> disappeared into
the camps, but even at the height of the civil war there were less
than 100,000, including ordinary criminals, in the prison system. The
Cheka itself had 56 camps with a holding capacity of just 24,750 in
1922. The following year the number of camps had been halved. <a href="#n184" name="f184">[184]</a>
Solzhenitsyn suggests that the low numbers are a result of mass
executions. Certainly there were some such executions of prisoners,
although they were not Cheka policy and the most serious were in
direct contravention of Cheka orders. <a href="#n185" name="f185">[185]</a>
In the White areas there were few camps for the simple reason that
mass execution was the policy, contrary to Pipes&#8217;s ridiculous claim
that &#8216;the White armies ... never elevated terror to the status of
policy&#8217;. <a href="#n186" name="f186">[186]</a> In the White
controlled Don of Krasnov and Kaledin, for instance, Order No.&nbsp;2428 read:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It is forbidden to arrest workers. The orders are to hang
or shoot them.</p>

<p class="fst">Order No.&nbsp;2431 elaborated:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The orders are to hang all arrested workers in the
street. The bodies are to be exhibited for three days. <a href="#n187" name="f187">[187]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Not only was the <em>extent</em> of the prison system utterly
different under War Communism from how it was under Stalin, so was
its <em>nature</em>. The systematic degradation and torture of
prisoners, so powerfully recounted by Solzhenitsyn, was not, as he
maintains, a feature of the pre-Stalin period. The 1924 Corrective
Labour Code stated:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The regimen should be devoid of any trace of cruel or
abusive treatment, the following by no means permitted: handcuffs,
punishment cells, solitary confinement, denial of food, keeping
prisoners behind bars during conversations with visitors. <a href="#n188" name="f188">[188]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Medvedev argues that &#8216;in most cases this code was observed at
the time&#8217; and that although &#8216;in the early 1920s there were quite
a few instances that could be classified as insulting treatment of
prisoners ... this was the exception, not the rule&#8217;. <a href="#n189" name="f189">[189]</a>
Indeed the Bolsheviks insisted that prisoners received the same food
as those outside, poor though it was. Prisoners were allowed freedom
of speech and of the press. They often produced their own journals
which expressed views hostile to the government. In Irkutsk prisoners
produced <strong>Thought Behind Bars</strong>, in Vitebsk, Omsk and elsewhere
<strong>Prisoners Thought</strong> appeared and in Kharkov, Penza and other
places <strong>The Prisoners Voice</strong> was published. <a href="#n190" name="f190">[190]</a>
Needless to say not a trace of this regime was to survive into the
Stalin years. In any case, the Bolsheviks were clear that the prison
regime was a product of the civil war. A Cheka decree of January 1921 read:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The prisons are filled to overflowing, not with bourgeois
but for the most part with workers and peasants [involved in theft or
speculation]. This legacy [of the civil war] must be done away with;
the prisons must be emptied and we must carefully see to it that only
those who are really dangerous to the Soviet regime should be put
there. <a href="#n191" name="f191">[191]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The third example often used by right-wing historians is based on
Cheka leader Latsis&#8217;s 1918 claim that whether a suspect was a
capitalist or a worker was enough to determine their guilt or
innocence. He went on to urge, &#8216;Don&#8217;t search the records for
whether someone&#8217;s revolt against the Soviet was an armed or only a
verbal one&#8217;. <a href="#n192" name="f192">[192]</a> Sam Farber
quotes Latsis, but does not bother to quote Lenin&#8217;s angry rebuttal
in which he said that &#8216;one need not go to the same absurd lengths
as Comrade Latsis.&#8217; Lenin went on to insist that Latsis &#8216;wanted
to say that Red Terror meant the forcible suppression of exploiters
who attempted to restore their rule, but instead he put it this way
... &#8220;Don&#8217;t search (!!?) the records for evidence of whether his
revolt against the Soviet was an armed or only a verbal one&#8221;.&#8217; <a href="#n193" name="f193">[193]</a></p>

<p>Nor was this attitude peculiar to Lenin. Dzerzhinsky himself
personified the high ideals at which the Cheka aimed. He had spent a
third of his life in prison for his political beliefs and he
ruthlessly punished Chekists who were guilty of abuses. He insisted
that Chekists must have &#8216;a cool head, a warm heart and clean
hands&#8217;. <a href="#n194" name="f194">[194]</a> Dzerzhinsky&#8217;s
integrity was irreproachable: he angrily turned away a fellow worker
who tried to give him bacon and potatoes during the terrible days of
Russia&#8217;s famine. The burden of his work weighed heavily on his
shoulders. On the eve of 1919, during the worst days of the terror,
he turned to his fellow Bolsheviks saying:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I have spilt so much blood that I no longer have any
right to live. You must shoot me now. <a href="#n195" name="f195">[195]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The same mood seized many other Chekists. Bukharin once said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Do not let us forget how many of them who remain are
nervous wrecks, and sometimes hopelessly ill. For their work was such
torture, demanding such enormous concentration, it was so hellish,
that it called for a truly iron character. <a href="#n196" name="f196">[196]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Of course not all Chekists possessed this &#8216;iron character&#8217;.
Some abused their power. Some tortured, imprisoned and executed
unjustly. Latsis, his outburst noted above notwithstanding, could,
like Dzerzhinsky, show understanding of the complexity of the Cheka&#8217;s
task. He insisted that to stop the power of the Cheka corrupting its
members they should meet three criteria: they should be a party
member, they should have a high degree of personal integrity and they
should not stay long in the service of the Cheka. <a href="#n197" name="f197">[197]</a>
Rotation of staff was partially implemented and many Bolsheviks spent
at least some time in the Cheka.</p>

<p>Are these mere anecdotal or biographical details? No, they speak
of the very nature of the regime. Among the Whites corruption and
utterly indiscriminate terror ran from top to bottom of the regime;
indeed, as we have seen, in many cases the senior commanders were
personally responsible for some of the worst atrocities. With the
Bolsheviks the atrocities ran against the nature of the regime and
once the necessity of the Red Terror could be dispensed with the
Bolsheviks moved swiftly to curtail it. Even while the civil war
raged the role of the Cheka was restricted once the periods of
immediate danger were past. Leggett notes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In the inevitable clash between the arbitrary violence of
the Cheka and the system of Soviet law evolved by the People&#8217;s
Commissariat for Justice, the Cheka gained the upper hand whenever
the regime came under threat; when the crises receded, the [People&#8217;s
Commissariat) won the advantage. <a href="#n198" name="f198">[198]</a></p>

<p class="fst">And Latsis himself argued that the Cheka:</p>

<p class="quoteb">has no place in our constitutional system. The time of
civil war, the time of extraordinary conditions of existence of
Soviet power, will pass, and the Cheka will become superfluous. <a href="#n199" name="f199">[199]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But the longer the civil war lasted, the more declassed the
proletariat became, the more relations with the peasantry worsened,
the more the Cheka grew and the worse the quality of its members
became. Latsis noted that &#8216;unworthy elements, sometimes even
counter-revolutionaries, attached themselves to the Vecheka, some for
motives of personal gain&#8217;. <a href="#n200" name="f200">[200]</a>
Serge observed the &#8216;rapid effects&#8217; of &#8216;professional
degeneration&#8217; among the Chekists and recorded that &#8216;Dzerzhinsky
himself judged them to be &#8220;half rotten&#8221;, and saw no solution to
the evil except in shooting the worst Chekists and abolishing the
death penalty as soon as possible&#8217;. <a href="#n201" name="f201">[201]</a></p>

<p>The Bolsheviks moved to dismantle the Cheka as soon as the civil
war was over. In 1921 Dzerzhinsky made his own proposals for the
reform of the Cheka. Kamenev believed they did not go far enough and
wrote to Lenin with his own proposal:</p>

<p class="quoteb">1.Relieve the Cheka of everything except political
crimes, espionage, banditry, security of railroads and stores.
Nothing more. The rest to go to the NKlu [People&#8217;s Commissariat of Justice].</p>

<p class="quoteb">2.The Cheka&#8217;s investigative apparatus to be merged with
the NKlu ... <a href="#n202" name="f202">[202]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Lenin replied:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Comrade Kamenev! My position is closer to yours than to
Dzerzhinsky&#8217;s. I advise you not to give way, and to raise [the
issue] in the Politburo. Then we shall make a stand for the very
maximum. In addition we shall make the NKlu responsible for any
failure to report to the Politburo ... on the Vecheka&#8217;s defects and
errors. <a href="#n203" name="f203">[203]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In February 1922 the Soviet government abolished the Cheka and
replaced it with a new force, the GPU. The Cheka&#8217;s extraordinary
powers were not transferred to the GPU. It could only deal with
political cases, it had no power to sentence and it had no power to
execute. Even its powers of search and arrest were more tightly
defined than those of modern Britain&#8217;s Special Branch. Any arrested
person had to be told of the charge against him within 14 days and
sent to trial or released within eight weeks. <a href="#n204" name="f204">[204]</a>
Of course, even when these reforms worked fully they left intact
institutions which had been brutalised by the experience of civil
war. Yet it was only later in the 1920s, as Stalin&#8217;s hand closed
around the throat of the revolution, that the GPU became the
terrorist organ of a new bureaucratic ruling class:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The reconstruction of the Cheka-GPU went on for some
years in the first half of the 1920s. But it slowed down after the
deaths of Lenin and Dzerzhinsky; indeed things started moving in an
entirely different direction. The GPU gradually began to resume the
functions that were appropriate only for a period of civil war. Under
pressure from Stalin, a punitive organisation reappeared, with the
right to put people in jail and camps, to exile them to remote
places, and later even to shoot them without any judicial procedure,
simply as an administrative act. <a href="#n205" name="f205">[205]</a></p>

<p class="fst">When, in 1930, one of Stalin&#8217;s victims told his interrogator
that his methods would have been impossible in Dzerzhinsky&#8217;s day,
the interrogator laughed, &#8216;You&#8217;ve found someone to remember!
Dzerzhinsky &#8211; that&#8217;s a bygone stage in our revolution&#8217;. <a href="#n206" name="f206">[206]</a>
And Bukharin, shortly before his own execution in 1938, observed:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Dzerzhinsky is gone; the remarkable traditions of the
Cheka have gradually faded into the past, when the revolutionary idea
guided all its actions. <a href="#n207" name="f207">[207]</a><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Peasant rebellion, Kronstadt and the crisis of War Communism</h4>

<p class="fst">The Bolsheviks won the civil war, but only at enormous cost. After
the First World War the country was battered and bloodied, large
sections of its industry were ruined and agriculture was severely
disorganised. After the civil war the situation was far worse.
Travelling in Russia in 1920 H.G. Wells saw only &#8216;a vast
irreparable breakdown&#8217;. <a href="#n208" name="f208">[208]</a> The
Central Committee for Labour Conscription reported:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The workers of the towns and some of the villages choke
in the throes of hunger. The railroads barely crawl. The houses are
crumbling. The towns are full of refuse. Epidemics spread and death
strikes to the right and left. Industry is ruined. <a href="#n209" name="f209">[209]</a></p>

<p class="fst">None of this was an exaggeration. <strong>Pravda</strong> reported that
there were 17 cartloads of rubbish piled up in <em>every house</em> in
Petrograd because it had not been collected during the civil war. In
the depopulated streets of the revolution&#8217;s first city grass and
flowers broke through the paving stones. In 1921 <strong>Pravda</strong>
reported that 25 million were suffering from famine. In the country
people dug up buried horses and ate the flesh. In some areas
cannibalism was the only alternative to death. &#8216;Everyday life was
prehistoric,&#8217; said Ilia Ehrenburg, &#8216;the everyday life of the cave
age.&#8217; <a href="#n210" name="f210">[210]</a> One Russian economist
of the 1920s wrote: &#8216;Such a decline in the productive forces ... of
an enormous society of a hundred million is unprecedented in human
history.&#8217; <a href="#n211" name="f211">[211]</a> Perhaps nothing
conveys the poverty of Russia more vividly than the fact that average
income in Russia was nearly 20 percent <em>less</em> than that of
Britain in 1688. And that was in 1913; after the civil war the
proportion must have been much lower. <a href="#n212" name="f212">[212]</a></p>

<p>The White and imperialist armies had of course directly caused
much of the damage. The workers&#8217; state was cut off from cotton
until 1920, from Baltic flax and Baku oil until late 1919, and from
iron and coal from the Ukraine until 1920. The economic blockade by
the imperialist powers was only lifted in 1920. And the war effort
had eaten up much of what remained of industry. The Bolsheviks, said
the critic Viktor Shklovski, &#8216;ruined whole factories to make boots
out of [machine] fan belts&#8217;. <a href="#n213" name="f213">[213]</a>
In Russia as a whole the size of the working class was more than
halved. In the major cities the proportion of workers fell even more
dramatically. In February 1921 <strong>Pravda</strong> announced a &#8216;severe
defeat on the labour front&#8217;. Sixty four of the largest factories in
Petrograd were forced to close for lack of fuel. Among them was the
Putilov works, the cradle of the revolution. <a href="#n214" name="f214">[214]</a></p>

<p>In mid&#8211;1920 the Polish army invaded Russia from the west and the
last White army in European Russia, headed by General Wrangel, drove
north from the Crimea. In the midst of this crisis rebellion swept
the countryside once again. Requisitioning was still in force,
despite the poor harvest of 1920. Two of the peasant revolts from
1920 and 1921 have acquired political significance: Antonov&#8217;s
&#8216;Green&#8217; revolt in the province of Tambov, and Makhno&#8217;s revolt
in the Ukraine. For Sam Farber the Reds&#8217; response to these
rebellions &#8216;which were socially and politically quite different
from the White rebellions&#8217; was based in part &#8216;on a monstrous and
schematic mockery of Marxist class analysis&#8217; which affected the
revolution&#8217;s &#8216;internal strength and ability to resist the logic
of Stalinist politics&#8217;. <a href="#n215" name="f215">[215]</a></p>

<p>In fact the Tambov and Ukrainian risings gained popular support
for precisely the same reason as the White rebellions: the
peasantry&#8217;s opposition to grain requisitioning. Of course the White
rebellions were headed by the personnel of the Tsarist old order
while the Tambov and Ukrainian risings were not. Yet the only
possible beneficiaries of any success that the peasant rebellions
might have had against the Reds would be the Whites: there is no
question that either Antonov or Makhno had either support outside
limited geographical areas or an articulated political programme of
their own. Indeed Antonov had backed Wrangel, as his fellow SRs had
backed the Whites throughout the civil war (although they distanced
themselves from Antonov&#8217;s revolt). The SR influenced Union of
Working Peasantry in the densely wooded, intensely rural Tambov
region had vowed to &#8216;fight the Bolsheviks to the end&#8217;. <a href="#n216" name="f216">[216]</a></p>

<p>And the methods used by Makhno and Antonov in their fight against
the Red Army often mirrored those used by the Whites. Bolsheviks
caught by the Tambov Greens were nailed to trees, a single railroad
spike driven through their left hand and foot lifting them a few feet
above the ground. Bruce Lincoln writes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The Greens maimed and mutilated their victims, flaying
some, quartering others, and disembowelling still others ... [they]
gouged out eyes, chopped off limbs, mutilated sexual organs, slashed
tendons ... unravelled intestines ... often buried captured enemies
alive, but took care to leave their victims&#8217; heads above ground so
that peasant women could urinate on them before the village dogs
closed in to gnaw the still living flesh from their faces and skulls.
<a href="#n217" name="f217">[217]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In response, the Red Army &#8216;at first alternated between wholesale
cruelty, in which they burned whole villages ... and extreme leniency
in which they pardoned prisoners <em>en masse</em>&#8217;. <a href="#n218" name="f218">[218]</a>
Later mass shootings became more widespread as the Red Army became
bogged down in a guerrilla battle with an enemy little different from
the mass of peasants who sheltered them. Characteristically, Sam
Farber mentions the shootings but not the pardons, the Red Terror but
not the Green Terror.</p>

<p>Makhno&#8217;s smaller rebellion in the Ukraine is distinguished from
the Tambov rising only by the muddled anarchism of its leader.
Makhno&#8217;s relations with the Bolsheviks were chequered, reflecting
the fast changing military situation in the Ukraine throughout the
civil war. The revolution released Makhno from prison and, with Lenin
and Sverdlov&#8217;s help, he returned to the Ukraine in July 1918 while
it was still under German puppet ruler Hetman Skoropadsky. Makhno
organised a partisan Insurgent Army to fight Skoropadsky and sided
with the Red Army when it marched against the Whites in December
1918. Cooperation continued until June 1919 when the Insurgent Army
broke from the Red Army: &#8216;as soon as Makhno left the front he and
his associates began to organise new partisan detachments in the
Bolsheviks&#8217; rear, which subsequently attacked strongholds, troops,
police, trains and food collectors&#8217;. <a href="#n219" name="f219">[219]</a></p>

<p>Denikin&#8217;s advance against Makhno&#8217;s territory in autumn 1919
quickly forced a renewal of the treaty with the Bolsheviks. Makhno
harassed Denikin&#8217;s troops from the rear, making their advance more
difficult. But by the end of 1919 the immediate White threat was
removed. Makhno refused to move his troops to the Polish front to
meet the imminent invasion and hostilities with the Red Army began
again on an even more widespread scale. The entries in the diary of
Makhno&#8217;s wife betray the nature of the movement in this period:</p>

<p class="quoteb">February 23,1920 &#8211; Our men seized Bolshevik agents, who
were shot.</p>

<p class="quoteb">February 25, 1920 &#8211; Moved to Maiorovo. Caught three
agents for the collection of grain there. Shot them.</p>

<p class="quoteb">March 14, 1920 &#8211; Today we moved into Velikaya
Mikhailovka, killed here one Communist. <a href="#n220" name="f220">[220]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Reports from the Soviet Ukrainian Front give the same picture:</p>

<p class="quoteb">June 18 &#8211; Makhno carried out a raid on the station at
Grishno, held out there three hours, shot fourteen captured officials
of the Soviet and workers&#8217; organisations, destroyed the telegraph
communication and robbed the food warehouse of the railroad workers.</p>

<p class="quoteb">July 26 &#8211; Bursting into Konstantinograd County, Makhno
in the course of two days cut down 84 Red Army soldiers.</p>

<p class="quoteb">August 16 &#8211; having seized Mirgorod for a day and a half
Makhno&#8217;s followers robbed all the warehouses of the county food
committee, destroyed the buildings of theSoviet and workers&#8217;
organisations, smashed 15 telegraph machines, killed 21 workers and
Red soldiers. <a href="#n221" name="f221">[221]</a></p>

<p class="fst">These actions were consistent with an earlier resolution of the
Insurgent Army which declared that it was &#8216;the actions of the
Bolshevik regime which cause a real danger to the worker-peasant
revolution&#8217;. In fact it was Makhno&#8217;s actions against the Red Army
which made &#8216;a brief return of the Whites possible&#8217;. <a href="#n222" name="f222">[222]</a>
General Wrangel attacked while Makhno&#8217;s forces were fighting the
Red Army: &#8216;As Wrangel advanced ... Makhno retreated north ...
leaving behind small partisan units in the villages and towns to
carry out covert destruction of the Bolshevik administrative
apparatus and supply bases&#8217;. <a href="#n223" name="f223">[223]</a>
These activities were so effective that White Colonel Noga reported
to headquarters that Makhno was crucial to Wrangel&#8217;s advance. <a href="#n224" name="f224">[224]</a>
Indeed Wrangel approached Makhno for a formal alliance and although
this was turned down Makhno did not fight with the Reds again until
October 1920 when Wrangel advanced on Makhno&#8217;s base. It was,
unsurprisingly, a treaty of convenience on the part of both sides and
as soon as Wrangel was defeated at the end of the year the Red Army
fought Makhno until he gave up the struggle and crossed the Dniester
river into Romania in August 1921.</p>

<p>Could Makhno have provided a libertarian alternative to the
Bolsheviks? The answer lies in the nature of the Makhno movement.
Firstly, the movement never had any real support from the working
class. Neither was it particularly interested in developing a
programme which would appeal to workers. Paul Avrich, the sympathetic
historian of the anarchists, writes that Makhno:</p>

<p class="quoteb">failed to win over more than a minority of workers, for
unlike the farmers and artisans of the village, who were independent
producers accustomed to managing their own affairs, factory hands and
miners operated as interdependent parts of a complicated industrial
machine ... He never understood the complexities of the urban
economy, nor did he care to understand them. <a href="#n225" name="f225">[225]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Makhno&#8217;s advice to workers aimed at reproducing the
petit-bourgeois patterns of the countryside &#8211; he told railway workers
in Aleksandrovsk who had not been paid for many weeks that they
should simply charge passengers a fair price and so generate their
own wages. <a href="#n226" name="f226">[226]</a> In the countryside
of course such politics could have greater appeal. But even here any
attempt to go beyond the traditional peasant economy was doomed.
Makhno&#8217;s memoirs admit that &#8216;the mass of the people did not go
over&#8217; to his peasant communes, which only involved a few hundred
families. <a href="#n227" name="f227">[227]</a> The real basis of
Makhno&#8217;s support was not his anarchism, but his opposition to grain
requisitioning and his determination not to disturb the peasant economy:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Makhno had not put an end to the agricultural
inequalities. His aim was to avoid conflicts with the villages and to
maintain a sort of united front of the entire peasantry. <a href="#n228" name="f228">[228]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In 1919 the local Bolshevik authorities made mistakes which played
into Makhno&#8217;s hands: despite Lenin&#8217;s advice they were dismissive
of Ukrainian nationalism and they tried to carry through
socialisation of the land, rather than handing it over to the
peasants. But by spring 1920 they had reversed the policy towards the
peasants and instituted Committees of Poor Peasants. These &#8216;hurt
Makhno ... his heart became hardened and he sometimes ordered
executions&#8217;. <a href="#n229" name="f229">[229]</a> This policy
helped the Bolshevik ascendancy.</p>

<p>It is hardly surprising, given this social base, that much of
Makhno&#8217;s libertarianism amounted to little more than paper decrees.
On paper the officers of the Insurgent Army were elected &#8211; in
practice the most senior commanders were appointed by Makhno. <a href="#n230" name="f230">[230]</a>
One resolution adopted at a meeting of the partisans gives the
flavour of the movement: &#8216;to obey the orders of the commanders if the
commanders are sober enough to give them&#8217;. <a href="#n231" name="f231">[231]</a>
In theory Makhno&#8217;s was a volunteer army. In reality &#8216;he was
compelled to inaugurate a form of conscription in order to replenish
his forces&#8217;. <a href="#n232" name="f232">[232]</a> Makhno held
elections, but no parties were allowed to participate in them. Papers
could be published, but the Bolshevik and Left Socialist
Revolutionary press were not allowed to call for revolution. <a href="#n233" name="f233">[233]</a>
Makhno was quick to denounce the Soviet &#8216;institutions of violence,
such as your Commissariats and Chekas&#8217;, but &#8216;Makhno&#8217;s private
Cheka ... quickly disposed of anyone who was suspected of plotting
against his life&#8217;. <a href="#n234" name="f234">[234]</a> Makhno&#8217;s
army actually had two security forces, the Cheka-like Razvedka and
the Punitive Commission, which &#8216;appears to have been headed by
Makhno&#8217;s wife&#8217;. <a href="#n235" name="f235">[235]</a> Their
activities were far from negligible:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Makhno&#8217;s later campaigns are among the most bloody and
vindictive in history, and in the circumstances we can safely assume
that these [security] services were responsible for frequent
injustices and atrocities. Volin [Makhno&#8217;s close associate] is
witness to the fact that they were under no effective control. <a href="#n236" name="f236">[236]</a></p>

<p class="fst">When a Bolshevik cell, which included a divisional commander, was
discovered in the Insurgent Army, the Bolsheviks were denied an open
trial and summarily shot by Makhno&#8217;s Razvedka. <a href="#n237" name="f237">[237]</a>
Neither Makhno&#8217;s social programme nor his political regime could
provide an alternative to the Bolsheviks. Even his military tactics
could only be effective in limited circumstances and only then so
long as they did not disturb the age old class structure of the
countryside. Ultimately his anarchism was a thin veneer on peasant rebellion.</p>

<p>The rising in Kronstadt in March 1921 had essentially the same
root as the peasant rebellions. Although it was preceded by a wave of
serious but quickly resolved strikes, the motivation of the Kronstadt
rebellion was much closer to that of the peasantry than it was to
dissatisfaction among what remained of the urban working class.
Kronstadt had, of course, been a stronghold of the revolution in 1917
but in 1921 it was strongly influenced by the mood of the peasantry.
There are several interlocking reasons why it became prey to the mood
sweeping the countryside.</p>

<p>Firstly, the composition of the garrison had changed. In September
and October 1920 the writer and Bolshevik Party lecturer Ieronymus
Yasinsky went to Kronstadt to lecture to 400 naval recruits. They
were &#8216;straight from the plough&#8217;. And he was shocked to find that
many, &#8216;including a few party members, were politically illiterate,
worlds removed from the highly politicised veteran Kronstadt sailors
who had deeply impressed him&#8217;. Yasinsky worried that those &#8216;steeled
in the revolutionary fire&#8217; would be replaced by &#8216;inexperienced,
freshly mobilised young sailors&#8217;. <a href="#n238" name="f238">[238]</a></p>

<p>By December 1920 only 1,313 recruits of the type interviewed by
Yasinsky had arrived in the Baltic Fleet (out of a planned total of
10,384). We do not know how many more new recruits arrived in the
three months before Kronstadt erupted in March 1921. But we do know
about the composition of some other units based at Kronstadt, like
the 2,500 Ukrainians of the 160th Rifle Regiment, recruited from
areas particularly friendly to the Makhno guerrillas and with less
than 2 percent of Bolsheviks in its ranks. <a href="#n239" name="f239">[239]</a></p>

<p>Further evidence of the changing class composition of the garrison
can be gleaned from the breakdown of the social background of the
Bolsheviks at the base. In September 1920, six months before the
revolt, the Bolsheviks had 4,435 members at Kronstadt. Some 50
percent of these were peasants, 40 percent were workers and 10
percent were intellectuals. <a href="#n240" name="f240">[240]</a> The
same figures for the Bolshevik Party as a whole in 1921 are: 28.7
percent peasants, 41 percent workers and 30.8 percent white collar
workers and others. <a href="#n241" name="f241">[241]</a> Thus the
percentage of peasants in the party in Kronstadt was considerably
higher than nationally. It was also higher than the already unusually
high percentage of peasants among the members who had joined the
party in 1921. <a href="#n242" name="f242">[242]</a> If we assume
that the Bolshevik Party was more working class in composition than
the Kronstadt base as a whole, then it seems likely that the peasants
had increased their weight in Kronstadt, as Trotsky suggested.</p>

<p>Sam Farber argues that the new peasant recruits would not have
been enough to alter the mood of the other sailors. He criticises the
Trotskyist tradition in general, and Chris Harman&#8217;s <strong>How the
Revolution was Lost</strong> in particular, for arguing that &#8216;Kronstadt
in 1920 was not Kronstadt of 1917. The class composition of its
sailors had changed.&#8217; <a href="#n243" name="f243">[243]</a> But
even if, for the sake of argument, we accept Sam Farber&#8217;s
interpretation of the evidence (and he does not look at the figures
for the composition of the Bolsheviks) his point only has any
validity if we take the statistics in isolation. But in reality this
change in composition acted on a fleet whose ties with the peasantry
had recently been strengthened in other ways. In particular, the
Kronstadt sailors had recently been granted leave for the first time
since the civil war. Many returned to their villages and came face to
face with the condition of the countryside and the trials of the
peasantry faced with food detachments. Stepan Petrichenko, the leader
of the Kronstadt rising, returned to his native Ukraine between April
and the autumn of 1920. He found that:</p>

<p class="quoteb">When we returned home our parents asked us why we fought
for the oppressors. That set us thinking. <a href="#n244" name="f244">[244]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In fact Petrichenko became so embittered that he tried to join the
Whites, and was only turned away because of his previous brief
membership of the Communist Party. <a href="#n245" name="f245">[245]</a>
Many other sailors had similar experiences to Petrichenko when they
returned to the villages, as the hundreds of letters to the
Complaints Bureau of the Baltic Fleet testify. Here is part of just
one from a sailor of the Petropavlovsk, the battleship at the heart
of the rebellion:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Ours is an ordinary peasant farm, neither Kulak nor
parasitical; yet when I and my brother return from serving the Soviet
republic people will sneer at our wrecked farm and say: &#8216;What did
you serve for? What has the Soviet republic given you?&#8217; <a href="#n246" name="f246">[246]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Desertions began to spiral and leave was cancelled. &#8216;By 1921 the
fleet was falling apart as an organised military force.&#8217; <a href="#n247" name="f247">[247]</a>
It was the fleet&#8217;s links with the peasantry which provided the
bedrock for the rebellion, but other factors exacerbated the
situation. The ideology of the Kronstadt garrison was one factor.
Even in its heroic days the garrison had an ultra-left air. Many
Kronstadters had sided with the left communists at the time of
Brest-Litovsk, a number of them had joined the LSRs uprising in the
summer of 1918. They had opposed food requisitioning in 1918 and were
fierce opponents of Red Army type discipline. <a href="#n248" name="f248">[248]</a></p>

<p>Another factor in the rebellion was the decline of the Bolsheviks&#8217;
influence in Kronstadt. Many of the best Bolshevik militants of 1917
had fallen during the civil war and in the six months before the
rising the party lost half its members at the garrison.When the
revolt broke the sailors took over the battleships and garrison.</p>

<p>It was clear from the start that the accumulated pressure would
allow no easy solutions. Indeed, in Petrograd Zinoviev had already
essentially withdrawn the most detested aspects of War Communism in
response to the strikes. The Kronstadt sailors&#8217; response was
contained in their <strong>What We Are Fighting For</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There is no middle ground in the struggle against the
Communists ... They give the appearance of making concessions: in
Petrograd province roadblock detachments have been removed and 10
million gold roubles have been allotted for the purchase of
foodstuffs ... But one must not be deceived ... No, there can be no
middle ground. Victory or death! <a href="#n249" name="f249">[249]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Kronstadters&#8217; insistence that they were fighting for a
&#8216;third revolution&#8217;, freedom of expression and for &#8216;soviets
without parties&#8217; has convinced many historians that this revolt was
fundamentally distinct from the White rebellions. But one must be
careful to analyse exactly the difference between the conscious aims
of the rebels and the possible outcome of their actions. The
Bolshevik regime still rested on the shattered remnants of the
working class. The Kronstadt sailors&#8217; appeals to the Petrograd
workers had met with little or no response. The sailors represented
the exasperation of the peasantry with the War Communist regime, but
Kronstadt had no nationwide organisation and no other peasant
insurrection reproduced the Kronstadters&#8217; demands.</p>

<p>Had the Kronstadters&#8217; demands for &#8216;soviets without parties&#8217;
been realised they would have expressed the ferocious, elemental
hostility of the peasants to the Bolsheviks in particular and to the
cities in general. Yet in the wake of the fall of the Bolsheviks it
would not have been the moderate socialists who took power. They were
in any case weaker than the Bolsheviks and where they had tried to
govern in the non-Bolshevik areas they had, time and again, succumbed
to (and often aided) military dictatorships. The Whites, even though
their armies had been beaten in the field, were still not finished &#8211;
as the emigre response to the Kronstadt rising shows. In the vacuum
which would have followed the fall of the Bolsheviks, the Whites were
the only remaining political force which could have profited. This
may not have been the aim of the Kronstadt rebellion but, given its
utopian programme and its class root, this would have been its outcome.</p>

<p>The Whites sensed this immediately. They had predicted a rising in
Kronstadt and the White National Centre abroad strained might and
main to provide food for the Kronstadters, raising a total of nearly
1 million French francs, 2 million Finnish marks, &#163;5,000, $25,000
and 900 tons of flour in just two weeks. Indeed the National Centre
was already making plans for the forces of the French navy and those
of General Wrangel, who still commanded 70,000 men in Turkey, to land
in Kronstadt if the revolt were to succeed. <a href="#n250" name="f250">[250]</a>
As it became clear that the revolt was isolated Petrichenko was
forced to come to terms with the reality of the balance of class
forces. On 13 March Petrichenko wired David Grimm, the chief agent of
the National Centre and General Wrangel&#8217;s official representative
in Finland, for help in gaining food. On 16 March Petrichenko
accepted an offer of help from Baron P.V. Vilkin, an associate of
Grimm&#8217;s whom &#8216;the Bolsheviks rightly called a White agent&#8217;.
<a href="#n251" name="f251">[251]</a> None of the aid reached the
garrison before it was crushed, but the tide of events was pushing
the sailors into the arms of the Whites, just as the latter had
always suspected it would.</p>

<p>After the revolt was crushed, the link between the leaders of the
rebellion and the Whites became even more marked. Paul Avrich, the
historian sympathetic to the Kronstadt rising, says there is
&#8216;undeniable evidence&#8217; that the leadership of the rebellion came
to an agreement with the Whites after they had been crushed and that
&#8216;one cannot rule out the possibility that this was the continuation
of a long-standing relationship&#8217;. <a href="#n252" name="f252">[252]</a>
Petrichenko himself got in touch with Wrangel, once more using Grimm
as an intermediary. He joined forces with Wrangel, recruiting sailors
to join an underground counter-revolutionary fighting organisation in
Petrograd. Petrichenko further suggested to Wrangel that he make use
of the slogan, &#8216;Soviets without parties&#8217;, but only as a
&#8216;convenient political manoeuvre&#8217;. Once the Bolsheviks were beaten
&#8216;the slogan would be shelved and a temporary military dictatorship
installed.&#8217; The balance of class forces had finally brought
ideology and reality into alignment. <a href="#n253" name="f253">[253]</a></p>

<p>The Bolsheviks had no choice but to crush the revolt. Had they
waited, the ice in the Gulf of Finland would have melted, allowing
the battleships to attack Petrograd. The battle to take the garrison
was bloody, especially for the Bolsheviks. As they made their way
across the ice, the guns of the battleships and the island fortresses
cut them down in interlocking fields of fire. Hundreds of Red Army
soldiers disappeared through holes in the ice. The death toll was 600
Kronstadt sailors, including those shot after the base was captured,
and at least 10,000 Reds, including 15 of the 320 delegates from the
Bolshevik Party&#8217;s Tenth Congress who had joined the assault. It
was, as Trotsky said, a tragic necessity.</p>

<p>The end of War Communism would have come whether or not Kronstadt
had revolted. But the revolt made it absolutely clear the era was
over. The Kronstadt events were like a flash of lightning which threw
more glare upon reality than anything else&#8217;, said Lenin. <a href="#n254" name="f254">[254]</a> The
Tenth Party Congress adopted the New Economic Policy (NEP) which
ended grain requisitioning. Lenin told the Congress: &#8216;Only an
agreement with the peasantry can save the socialist revolution until
the revolution has occurred in other countries&#8217;. <a href="#n255" name="f255">[255]</a>
The NEP was a retreat from War Communism which itself had been a
retreat from the policies adopted immediately after the October
revolution. The longer the revolution remained isolated and the more
desperate the economic conditions in Russia, the more the retreat
would necessarily become severe and dangerous.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The rise of Stalinism</h4>

<p class="fst">The civil war had reduced industry to rubble. The working class
base of the workers&#8217; state, mobilised time and again to defeat the
Whites, the rock on which Bolshevik power stood, had disintegrated.
The Bolsheviks survived three years of civil war and wars of
intervention, but only at the cost of reducing the working class to
an atomised, individualised mass, a fraction of its former size, and
no longer able to exercise the collective power that it had done
in1917. Lenin wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The industrial proletariat ... owing to the war and to
the desperate poverty and ruin, has become declassed ... dislodged
from its class groove, and has ceased to exist as a proletariat ...
It has sometimes figured in statistics, but it has not held together
economically. <a href="#n256" name="f256">[256]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The bureaucracy of the workers&#8217; state was left suspended in
mid-air, its class base eroded and demoralised. Such conditions could
not help but have an effect on the machinery of the state and
organisation of the Bolshevik Party.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviks&#8217; monopoly of political power had been established
by virtue of the simple fact that, one by one, the parties who
opposed them passed over to the camp of armed counter-revolution. The
Cadets had, of course, been hand in glove with Kornilov even before
the October revolution and were the mainstay of every White
dictatorship which surfaced during the civil war. The Right Socialist
Revolutionaries had planned armed counter-revolution at the time of
the dispersal of the Constituent Assembly and had become
indistinguishable from the Cadets during the course of the civil war.
The Left Socialist Revolutionaries had been part of the Soviet
government in 1918 and remained a legal opposition until, in the
summer of that year, they attempted to overthrow the government in an
armed coup.</p>

<p>The Mensheviks were different. They vacillated. Some Mensheviks,
and some LSRs, split and joined the Bolsheviks. Some joined the
Whites. The rest alternated between accepting the legitimacy of the
government and agitating for its overthrow. The Bolsheviks treated
them accordingly. The Mensheviks were legalised or extended greater
freedom during those periods when they accepted the October
revolution and suppressed during those periods when they vowed to
return to a pre-October regime. As E.H. Carr notes:</p>

<p class="quoteb">If it was true that the Bolshevik regime was not prepared
after the first few months to tolerate an organised opposition, it
was equally true that no opposition was prepared to remain within
legal limits. The premise of the dictatorship was common to both
sides of the argument. <a href="#n257" name="f257">[257]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The vice-like pressure of the civil war had transformed the state
in other ways. The weight of the bureaucracy, of the army, of the
Cheka, had grown enormously during the civil war. Without these
institutions the October regime would have been swept away in a
bloody, reactionary counter-revolution. With them the October
revolution had become sclerotic and authoritarian. There were so many
&#8216;horrifying facts about drunkenness, debauchery, corruption,
robbery and irresponsible behaviour of many party members that one&#8217;s
hair simply stands on end&#8217;, one Central Committee member told the
Eighth Party Congress. <a href="#n258" name="f258">[258]</a> The
power of the bureaucracy, and within the bureaucracy the power of its
top layers, grew.</p>
<p>The Bolshevik Party itself had undergone dramatic changes. By the
end of the civil war only one party member in every ten actually
worked in a factory <a href="#n259" name="f259">[259]</a>, six out of
every ten were employed in the government or party machine and a
quarter of party members served in the Red Army, often in positions
of political or military authority. The military often returned home
and &#8216;assumed leading posts in the local soviets, in the economy, in
education and they persistently introduced everywhere that regime
which ensured success in the civil war&#8217;, argued Trotsky in <strong>The
Revolution Betrayed</strong>. <a href="#n260" name="f260">[260]</a></p>

<p>The need for discipline during the civil war, for centralisation,
was not something simply foisted on the party by the leadership. It
was a pressing need felt by the rank and file members every bit as
much as by the leadership:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There were times between 1918 and 1921, indeed, when
Lenin and his associates lagged somewhat behind a vociferous body of
local opinion which urged an extension and reinforcement of the
centralising and disciplinary trends ... <a href="#n261" name="f261">[261]</a></p>

<p class="quoteb">... |I]t was the civil war which did the trick. Almost
overnight it was witnessed that nearly all those dyed-in-the-wool
defenders of local rights in 1917 were now ready, however
reluctantly, to recognise that the military crisis called for the
introduction of stem internal discipline. <a href="#n262" name="f262">[262]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Tenth Party Congress was a traumatic experience. The crisis of
War Communism produced a massive wave of debate and opposition among
the Bolsheviks. There were no fewer than eight different platforms
put forward by different groups and individuals. The Workers&#8217;
Opposition presented an extensive critique of the direction the
regime was heading. The Workers&#8217; Opposition wanted to reform the
system by handing power to the trade unions and workers in the
factories. The difficulty was that the working class, as we have
seen, had been decimated. The Workers&#8217; Opposition&#8217;s plans could
only have led to a disintegration of the regime.</p>

<p>Lenin had a different two-fold solution. Firstly, he wanted to
stop the party &#8211; which he described as &#8216;sick, feverish&#8217; &#8211;
from tearing itself apart under the pressure of events. He declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There should not be the slightest trace of factionalism &#8211;
whatever its manifestations in the past. That we must not have on any
account [when there is a] tremendous preponderance of peasants in the
country, when their dissatisfaction with the proletarian dictatorship
is mounting, and when the demobilisation of the peasant army is
setting loose hundreds and thousands of broken men who have nothing
to do, whose only accustomed occupation is war and who breed
banditry. The atmosphere of the controversy is becoming extremely
dangerous and constitutes a direct threat to the dictatorship of the
proletariat. <a href="#n263" name="f263">[263]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The Congress voted to ban factions. Again it was not simply a
leadership <em>diktat</em>. Radek spoke for many when he told the Congress:</p>

<p class="quoteb">In voting for this resolution, I feel that it can well be
turned against us, nevertheless I support it. Let the Central
Committee in a moment of danger take the severest measures against
the best party comrades, if it finds this necessary. Let the Central
Committee even be mistaken! That is less dangerous than the wavering
which is&nbsp;now observable. <a href="#n264" name="f264">[264]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Neither was the ban considered total or permanent. When one senior
Bolshevik tried to get the Congress to agree a ban on separate
platforms in Central Committee elections, Lenin replied:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We cannot deprive the party and the members of the
Central Committee of the right to appeal to the party in the event of
disagreement on fundamental issues. Supposing we are faced with a
question like, say, the conclusion of the Brest peace? Can you
guarantee that no such question will arise? No, you cannot. In the
circumstances, the elections may have to be based on platforms. <a href="#n265" name="f265">[265]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Secondly, Lenin fought, in the last battle of his life, to reform
the bureaucracy from within. He said:</p>

<p class="quoteb">You can throw out the Tsar, throw out the landowners,
throw out the capitalists but you cannot &#8216;throw out&#8217; the
bureaucracy in a peasant country ... You can only <em>reduce</em> it by
slow and stubborn effort ... for many years to come. <a href="#n266" name="f266">[266]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Lenin sought Trotsky&#8217;s aid in undermining Stalin&#8217;s growing
power, he fought to strengthen the Workers&#8217; and Peasants&#8217;
Inspectorate which was meant to counter bureaucratic abuse and he
tried to combat the growing Russian chauvinism in the state machine.
But Lenin&#8217;s worsening health hampered him. He first became ill in
mid-1921, suffered a stroke in May 1922, returned to work but fell
ill again in December 1922. In March 1923 he was again stricken by a
stroke which left him partially paralysed and virtually unable to
speak until his death in January 1924. His last notes were insistent
that Stalin should be removed from the post of General Secretary.</p>

<p>But Lenin&#8217;s last battle, like Trotsky&#8217;s opposition to Stalin
which began in 1923, suffered from a fundamental weakness. After the
war the regime was left stranded. The well head of renewal and
thorough reform &#8211; the activity of the workers &#8211; had dried to a
trickle. Bureaucratic abuse and corruption were the inevitable
result. To appeal outside the machine, as the Workers&#8217; Opposition
had wanted, was impossible. This is the tragedy of Lenin&#8217;s last
fight and of the Left Opposition. They knew the problem but the means
at their disposal was not equal to the task. Hence the paucity of the
measures they advocated: self reform of the bureaucracy. Here is the
root of Trotsky&#8217;s defeat. To fight within the bureaucracy was to
fight on terms more favourable to Stalin than to Trotsky. Trotsky&#8217;s
strength, like Lenin&#8217;s, had always been his link with the workers.
From them he drew inspiration. On them he placed all his hopes for a
socialist society. Against their experience he judged the correctness
of his strategy. And, most of all, it was on the consciousness and
organisation of the workers that he relied in every major struggle.</p>

<p>Stalin, by contrast, relied on the machine &#8211; on the committee,
the threat, the order and the bribe. He was determined to &#8216;bury
Trotskyism&#8217;, insisting that the Trotskyist &#8216;cadres can be removed
only by civil war&#8217;. And civil war there was. It began with
Opposition speakers being heckled and assaulted. Then the whole vast
propaganda machine of the bureaucracy was turned against them. Later,
they were exiled, imprisoned and shot.</p>

<p>The Trotskyist Opposition fought courageously. It sometimes saw
its arguments gaining considerable ground among party members. Many
party members, especially the experienced party members who had lived
and fought through 1917, were supporters of the Opposition.</p>

<p>But ultimately, without a revival of struggle in Russia or
successful revolution elsewhere, the Opposition was doomed to
failure. That, however, could not be known in advance. Trotsky fought
on, even though the ground on which he stood was being consumed by
fire, in the hope that a revival of domestic or international
struggle would come to his aid. The only other choice was capitulation.</p>

<p>The Trotskyists&#8217; struggle delayed Stalin&#8217;s rise to power, a
rise which was only complete after the Left Opposition was broken in
1928, not before. This is why the majority of historians note the
difference between the &#8216;revolution&#8217; from above which came after
1928 and the period before 1928. The struggle of the Left Opposition
also made it obvious that Stalin was the betrayer of the revolution
and that his regime was the counter-revolutionary antithesis of the
October revolution. Stalin&#8217;s regime not only reversed every
remaining gain of October but had to annihilate the entire leadership
and many of the ordinary Bolsheviks who had made the October
revolution. The fact that he could do so by administrative terror,
not by the more normal means of an armed counter-revolutionary
seizure of power, was a result of the atomisation of the working
class. No wider use of force was necessary, no martial law, no curfew
or street battles, because the condition of the working class had
reduced the battle between revolution and counter-revolution to a
struggle concerning, albeit not exclusively, different sections of
the Bolshevik party. This should not blind us to the scale of the
counter-revolution which did take place, to the essential difference
between the Stalin regime and even the regime of the mid&#8211;1920s.
Stephen Cohen argues:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Stalin&#8217;s new policies of 1929&#8211;33, the &#8216;great
change&#8217; as they became known, were a radical departure from
Bolshevik programmatic thinking. No Bolshevik leader or faction had
ever advocated anything akin to imposed collectivisation, the
&#8216;liquidation&#8217; of allegedly prosperous peasants (kulaks),
breakneck heavy industrialisation, the destruction of the entire
market sector, and a &#8216;plan&#8217; that was in reality no plan at all,
only hyper-centralised control of the economy plus exhortations.
These years of &#8216;revolution from above&#8217; were, historically and
programmatically, the birth period of Stalinism. <a href="#n267" name="f267">[267]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Michael Reiman&#8217;s invaluable <strong>The Birth of Stalinism</strong>
arrives at similar conclusions by tracing in impressive detail the
completeness of this rupture. <a href="#n268" name="f268">[268]</a>
Cohen also argues:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Official ideology changed radically under Stalin. Several
of those changes have been noted by Western and Soviet scholars: the
revival of nationalism, statism, anti-Semitism, and conservative, or
reactionary, cultural and behavioural norms; the repeal of ideas and
legislation favouring workers, women, school children, minority
cultures, and egalitarianism, as well as a host of revolutionary and
Bolshevik symbols; and a switch in emphasis from ordinary people to
leaders and official bosses as the creators of history. They were not
simply amendments but a new ideology that was &#8216;changed in <em>essence</em>&#8217;
and that did &#8216;not represent the same movement as that which took
power in 1917&#8217;. <a href="#n269" name="f269">[269]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The point is not to idealise the Bolshevik regime of the early
1920s. Of course they had arrived at a point far distant from the
goals of 1917. This analysis is merely meant to demonstrate two
points. Firstly, it was overwhelmingly the force of circumstance
which obliged the Bolsheviks to retreat so far from their goals. They
travelled this route in opposition to their own theory, not because
of it &#8211; no matter what rhetorical justifications were given at the
time. And secondly, the alternatives available at the time were worse
than the Bolsheviks. Even those movements which, on paper, appeared
to have a more democratic programme (Workers&#8217; Opposition,
Kronstadt, Makhno) were either frauds (Makhno) or utopians. They were
utopians because they looked back to the institutions of 1917 when
the class which made such institutions possible no longer had the
collective capability to direct political life. This is the tragedy
of the early 1920s: the Bolsheviks had beaten their opponents by
destroying the base on which they stood &#8211; literally destroyed it by
death incurred at the front or by depopulating the cities as a result
of starvation, disease and flight to the country. The lack of
democracy was a result of this, not a first cause. The secret of the
Stalinist bureaucracy&#8217;s success lay in the devastation and
isolation of the workers&#8217; state.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The October revolution and politics today</h4>

<p class="fst">In many major industrialised countries the 1980s were mostly a
period of retreat for the workers&#8217; movement and the left,
irrespective of whether right-wing governments (Reagan, Thatcher,
Kohl) or right wing social democratic governments (Mitterrand, Hawke,
Gonzales) were in power. Under these conditions very considerable
sections of the left began to evolve, first, in the direction of left
reformism. This was the era of infatuation with the Labour left in
Britain, the Socialist Party in France, PASOK in Greece, the collapse
of the Italian revolutionary left and the rise of movementism
internationally. Latterly, faced with the failure of these projects
and very much under the influence of events in Eastern Europe and the
consequent collapse of the Western Communist Parties, this evolution
tended toward outright and almost unqualified identification with
bourgeois democracy, at least in intellectual circles.</p>

<p>This process was accelerated by the second Gulf War, during which
a number of socialists (Norman Geras and Fred Halliday in Britain,
for instance) decided to back US and British imperialism. Significant
numbers of others, notably the editorial board of <strong>New Left Review</strong>,
were, at best, careful to couch their partial opposition in terms
circumscribed by bourgeois democracy (support for sanctions, advocacy
of the UN). The result is that much of what now passes for socialist
thought is indistinguishable from run of the mill liberalism. The
swelling literature on citizenship, democratic and constitutional
reform, the virtues of civil society and so on are the unmistakable
symbols of this process. In this world the superiority of the market
is taken as axiomatic.</p>

<p>In these developments the history of the October revolution has a
key place. Once the argument that Lenin led to Stalin is established,
any alternative to the market and bourgeois democracy becomes that
much more difficult to make. To stray from the straight and narrow
road walked by J.S. Mill and Adam Smith is to court the gulag. We
live in the best of all possible worlds, runs the argument, and the
fate of the October revolution demonstrates the foolhardiness of
trying to change it. Paul Hirst, now a leading figure in the civil
rights group Charter 88, has latterly become so convinced that the
market and the rule of law are the only viable forms of society that
any vision of an alternative &#8211; whether Lenin&#8217;s or the eco-social
democracy of Vaclav Havel &#8211; are treated as dangerous utopian
dreams. <a href="#n270" name="f270">[270]</a></p>

<p>Robin Blackburn&#8217;s attempt to try and find the non-existent
thread that is supposed to connect those high priests of the free
market, von Mises and von Hayek, with Trotsky is another response to
these developments. Blackburn&#8217;s point seems to be that, as Trotsky
argued that some form of market mechanism would be used in the
transition to a communist society, the leader of the Russian
Revolution must have something in common with today&#8217;s descendants
of von Hayek and von Mises. The small question of which class is in
power, the capitalist class or the working class, does not impinge on
this analysis. Or at least it only impinges to the extent that the
market is assumed to be a strategy for gaining power, rather than a
mechanism that may be used, under greatly altered conditions, once a
revolution has succeeded. It is, then, merely the difference between
reform and revolution.</p>

<p>So many of these arguments depend on a revival, in whole or in
part, of an essentially Cold War interpretation of the Russian
Revolution. Yet if the history of the October revolution is not as
one-time socialists would have us believe, then the workers&#8217;
movement of today still has a powerful weapon in its armoury. Mass
unemployment, war and imperialism, third world starvation and first
world poverty, homelessness and economic exploitation, racism and
sexism, anti-union laws and, at best, castrated political rights are
not all that the world has to offer. Then the unprecedented political
freedom, the cultural and artistic explosion, the unique economic
liberation, the sexual and national risings that were the hallmark of
the early days of the October revolution, and which this essay on the
dark hours of the revolution has had little time to consider, are
still within our reach. The October revolution is our past. It is
also our future. We should not relinquish it so easily.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f40" name="n40">40.</a> The Bolsheviks withdrew the
slogan, &#8216;All power to the soviets&#8217;, after the defeat of the July
Days since they worried that the leadership of the soviets had
irretrievably fallen into the hands of the moderate socialists.
Instead they briefly based their strategy on the more responsive
local factory committees. When the popular mood turned decisively
against the Provisional Government and the moderates in the soviets
the Bolsheviks returned to their original formulation. None of this
alters the essence of the Bolsheviks&#8217; strategy which was to take
power from the Provisional Government and put it in the hands of
popular organs of working class power a point later made explicit by
Trotsky in his <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1924/lessons/index.htm" target="new"><strong>The Lessons of October</strong></a> (Bookmarks, 1987).</p>

equivalent of the tactic now being pursued by museum curators in
Moscow: Trotsky&#8217;s portrait has been restored to the galleries, but
it is always placed alongside Stalin&#8217;s. The meaning is unspoken but
clear: &#8216;Stalin was bad, but so was Trotsky so there is no point in
looking to him for an alternative.&#8217; Slovo makes the point explicit:
&#8216;I believe we should exercise some caution before we accept Pallo
Jordan&#8217;s rather sweeping judgement that we must turn to the works
of &#8220;oppositionists&#8221; (including Trotsky) to discover the true
meaning of the communist vision.&#8217;</p>

It is worth noting that, even if the most exaggerated claims for the
killings of the Cheka were true, 140,000 over the whole of the civil
war (see Pipes, <strong>op. cit.</strong>, p.&nbsp;838), this figure is still
lower than the number of Jews murdered by the Whites in just one
area, in just one year: the Ukraine in 1919.</p>

see, for instance, pp.&nbsp;238&#8211;39. He also points out that some
workers&#8217; takeovers were meant to push the government into taking
some share in management because &#8216;workers&#8217; management proved
incapable of dealing with the immense problems affecting production&#8217;,
especially in the big factories.</p>

Leggett also cites S.P. Melgounov&#8217;s, <strong>The Red Terror in Russia</strong>.
But Leggett is quite wrong to describe Melgounov as a &#8216;respected
socialist politician&#8217; (p.&nbsp;185). Melgounov&#8217;s account is
partial and filled with unbalanced judgements. For example, &#8216;Not
for nothing do the three letters which stand for the title of the
All-Russian Extraordinary Commission of the Cheka stand also for the
three Russian words which denote &#8220;Death to every man&#8221;.&#8217; (!), p.&nbsp;41,</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f185" name="n185">185.</a> For instance the Cheka
executed prisoners the night before the death penalty was abolished
in 1920. See Mary McAuley, <strong>Bread and Authority: State and Society
in Petrograd 1917&#8211;1922</strong> (Oxford, 1991), p.&nbsp;391. The Cheka
also carried out executions by transferring prisoners to front line
areas when the death penalty was abolished in the rear during the
civil war. Further evidence that, unlike the White Terror, the Red
Terror was more severe the further it was from the leadership is
contained in McAuley, p.&nbsp;386: &#8216;As in the French revolution ...
terror was worse in provincial towns ... than in capital cities. It
was the terrible provincial blood letting that caused the concern in
the party press of October&#8211;December 1918 ... the terror of September
and October provoked a reaction within the party and was tacitly
abandoned within a few weeks.</p>
