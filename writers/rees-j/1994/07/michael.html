<p class="fst">Peter Linebaugh wrote to me about your case. While I can
understand the pressures on you to take such a decision, I cannot say
how strongly I hope that you will change your mind.</p>

<p>Peter is absolutely right to say that your decision will influence
much more than the feelings of the relatives of those who you killed.
It will influence the whole debate about capital punishment and
therefore the chances of others avoiding execution, some of whom will
have committed no crime.</p>

<p>You say in your letter to your friends and correspondents that you
would &#8216;like to expose these people for who they are in the hopes
that it will help prevent them from hiding the truth and manipulating
the outcome of someone else&#8217;s trial&#8217;.</p>

<p>I think you are mistaken in this argument. In this country the
Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire family have shown
that years of campaigning can force the judges and the political
establishment to back down. A host of other cases &#8211; the Cardiff
Three, the trials of those arrested in the anti-poll tax riot, the
case of the Taylor sisters wrongly accused of murder, those accused
of killing a policeman during the Broadwater Farm riots &#8211; have all
had success.</p>

<p>In your country many of these people would have been dead many
years ago, executed by the state. Any act which helps those who want
to keep or extend the death penalty endangers the lives of people
like these and many others.</p>

<p>That is why you must not give up the fight, even though you are
guilty. You cannot bring the women you killed back to life, but you
can play a part in saving the lives of those who the state will
execute if the pro death penalty lobby gains in strength. Many of
those the state will execute will be as innocent as the Birmingham
Six or the Taylor sisters in this country. Please stay alive to play
your part in saving their lives.</p>
