<p class="fst"><strong>What The Butler Saw</strong><br />
by Joe Orton</p>

<p class="fst">It could have been bad. The stalwarts of British TV sitcom, ancient (John Alderton from <em>Please Sir!</em>) and modern &#8211; Richard Wilson from the programme whose title overestimates its liveliness, <em>One Foot in the Grave</em> &#8211; lined up in a farce to pull the middle classes into the National Theatre. And all over by 10&nbsp;p.m. in time for the train to Guildford.</p>

<p>But, with the pen in Joe Orton&#8217;s hand, the joke is on the middle classes. Orton was famously and flamboyantly gay in a time when it was still a jailable offence no matter how old you were. He wasn&#8217;t interested in the farce of the Brian Rix variety.</p>

<p><em>What the Butler Saw</em> doesn&#8217;t even try to get a few chuckles out of mild innuendo about adultery. Orton&#8217;s out to get gales of laughter from transvestism, lesbianism, nymphomania and a few other things which it would do no good for potential audiences to find out about in a review.</p>

<p>The action takes place in a sanatorium where the doctor&#8217;s attempts to seduce an applicant for the post of his secretary, the calamitous state of his own marriage and the inconvenient arrival of a government inspector (by far the maddest of a barmy bunch) conspire to trigger the usual loss of sanity and outer garments.</p>

<p>In passing, quite a few establishment icons get demolished &#8211; Winston Churchill is revealed as, literally and metaphorically, a big prick, psychiatrists as crazed and/or sex maniacs, and policemen as crossdressers (well, actually, nearly everyone is a crossdresser in this play.)</p>

<p>Orton&#8217;s triumph is to take the almost moribund form of the farce and turn it into something which is progressive without being po-faced.</p>

<p>Orton&#8217;s intentions are most clearly signalled in his diaries:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;26 March 1967. Easter Day. Nothing on television but uplifting programmes. BBC crooning to itself as usual ... Kenneth [Halliwell, Orton&#8217;s lover], who read the <strong>Observer</strong>, tells me of the latest way-out group in America &#8211; complete sexual licence. &#8220;Its the only way to smash the wretched civilisation,&#8221; I said, making a mental note to hot up <em>What the Butler Saw</em>. Sex is the only way to infuriate them. Much more fucking and they&#8217;ll be screaming hysterics.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Now as a theory of revolution this may, as they say, leave something to be desired. Nevertheless, it produced a marvellously funny and subversive play, even if time and this production have taken out some of its bite.</p>

<p class="fst"><em>Plays at the National Theatre, London.</em></p>
