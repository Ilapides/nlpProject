<p class="fst">TO A TOURIST EYE, Paris in late July was back to normal. The <em>Folies Berg&egrave;res</em> &ndash; where the strike was one of the longest &ndash; is open again and the cobblestones of the Latin Quarter are being covered over with asphalt.</p>

<p>There is no obvious repression. Every bookstall is covered with books on the May events- The only shop we found that did not have a single book about May in its windows was the official Communist Party bookshop, which was concentrating on holidays in Rumania.</p>

<p>The satirical paper <strong>Canard Enchaine</strong> continued its anti-Gaullist [<em>line of text missing</em>] <strong>Action</strong> and <strong>Lutte Ouvri&egrave;re</strong> are sold on the streets of the Latin Quarter, despite the occasional seizure and arrest of sellers.</p>

<p>But behind this is a more sombre aspect. The banned groups proclaim their continued existence in slogans on the walls of the Underground. Plain-clothes policemen, carrying guns, follow suspicious elements.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Gaullist regime is quite clearly to act, not against freedom of ideas &ndash; which, with the word &ldquo;Revolution&rdquo; painted on every [<em>line of text missing</em>] tionary party a little sooner than some members of the libertarian left.</p>

<p>The general opinion of French comrades is that there is a long struggle ahead. There will not be a repetition of the May events in October, although it is possible that the universities will not be reopened as it will be impossible to prevent them being occupied by students.</p>

<p>In the factories a long struggle is developing. At the moment the crucial issue is overtime working to make up for the time during the strike.</p>

<p>[<em>line of text missing</em>] strike, hitherto almost unknown in France, is becoming more widespread, and there may be a wave of them in the autumn.</p>
