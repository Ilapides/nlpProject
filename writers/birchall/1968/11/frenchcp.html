<p class="fst">THE FRENCH COMMUNIST Party, battered by last summer&rsquo;s general strike and the Czech crisis, ran into new trouble when its Central Committee met on October 20 and 21.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest shock was the resignation from the Central Committee of Jeannette Thorez-Vermeersch. She is the widow of Maurice Thorez, leader of the party from its early years up to his death in 1964.</p>

<p>Mme. Thorez-Vermeersch has been angered by the party&rsquo;s disapproval of Russian intervention in Czechoslovakia, and has accused the leadership of helping &lsquo;anti-Soviet&rsquo; forces.</p>

<p>The party leaders also criticised one of France&rsquo;s leading communist intellectuals, Roger Garaudy, for having been too outspoken in his criticism of the Russians. Garaudy publicly accepted the criticisms.</p>

<p>This could be the first sign of a serious split in the party. There is a strong pro-Moscow group which has been distributing material published in Russia defending the Russian intervention. Some reports even suggest that this group may try to form a separate party.</p>

<p>But most of the leaders realise that to show public support for the Russians would ruin the party&rsquo;s parliamentary ambitions for years to come, especially since they can only win parliamentary seats in alliance with the social-democrats, who are strongly anti-Russian.</p>
