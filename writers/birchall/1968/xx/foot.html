<h2>Ian H. Birchall</h2>

<h1>[On the Labour Party]</h1>

<h3>(Autumn 1968)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <em>Letters from Our Readers</em>, <strong>International Socialism</strong> (1st series), <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isj/index.html#isj034" target="new">No.&nbsp;34</a>, Autumn 1968, p.&nbsp;28.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">In Paul Foot&#8217;s otherwise excellent article on <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/foot-paul/1968/xx/wilson.htm" target="new"><em>Harold Wilson and the Labour Left</em></a> (<strong>IS&nbsp;33</strong>), there is one questionable passage. Among <strong>Tribune</strong>&#8217;s sins is listed the fact that it &#8216;severely rebuked&#8217; Richard Gott for his independent &#8216;anti-Vietnam&#8217; candidature in 1966. In fact, <strong>Labour Worker</strong>, the then fortnightly organ of International Socialism, criticised Gott in rather more unkind terms than <strong>Tribune</strong>.</p>

<p>I raise this point, not out of historical pedantry, but because I think it is important to understand that we were right to take such a stand at that time. Gott&#8217;s action did not provide the basis for a real campaign against the Vietnam war, which has developed in a much more healthy non-Parliamentary fashion since, and it did isolate the anti-imperialist movement from the mass of the workers and trade unionists who might otherwise have been more sympathetic to it.</p>

<p>In more general terms, we have not sufficiently analysed the strategy of work in the Labour Party. There has been a tendency to forget about it as a wasted period; of course, social-democracy did not split, in classic 1920 style; the Labour fakers were not exposed to the masses in a blinding flash of light. But it is true that many militants, particularly youth, were attracted to the Labour Party in the 1962&ndash;1966 period. Their militancy has not been destroyed; some have joined revolutionary organisations; many more have turned to direct action on wages, rents or Vietnam; the rest still provide a reserve on which a new revolutionary party can draw. It is precisely this point that is missed by such undialectical analyses as Alasdair MacIntyre&#8217;s <em>Labour Policy and Capitalist Planning</em> (<strong>IS&nbsp;15</strong>), quoted approvingly by Foot. The installation of the Labour Government was not <em>purely and simply</em> a rationalisation of neo-capitalist planning; it was that, but it also had effects on consciousness that had a revolutionary potential.</p>

<p>A change of strategy is not necessarily opportunism. There is no need to rewrite our history; on the contrary, an honest writing of our own history is an essential part of the growth of our own self-consciousness.</p>
