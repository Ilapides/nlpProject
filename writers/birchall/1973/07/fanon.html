<p class="fst"><B>Frantz Fanon: A Critical Study</B><BR>Irene L.
Gendzier<BR><I>Wildwood House, &pound;1.75</I></p>

<p class="quoteb">&lsquo;We have seen military doctors, called to the
bedside of an Algerian soldier wounded in combat, refuse to treat
him. The official pretext was that there was no longer a chance to
save the wounded man. After the soldier had died, the doctor would
admit that this solution had appeared to him preferable to a stay in
prison where it would have been necessary to feed him while awaiting
execution. The Algerians of the region of Blida know a certain
hospital director who would kick the bleeding chests of the war
wounded while lying in the corridor of his establishment.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="fst">This account by Frantz Fanon of his experiences at the Blida
hospital in Algeria explains better than anything else in Gendzier&rsquo;s
book why this young West Indian psychiatrist abandoned medicine for
politics and joined the Algerian National Liberation Front.</P>
<P>Violence lies at the very heart of imperialism, and it was the raw
violence of the French war against the Algerian people that drew
together the threads of Fanon&rsquo;s thought.</P>
<P>The interest of Gendzier&rsquo;s book is that it is basically an
intellectual biography, showing how Fanon took his ideas from a
number of sources in order to weld together a critique of the
colonial situation. It is to be hoped this book marks the end of
Fanon as a trendy cult figure and opens the possibility of studying
him as a significant figure whose thought was still in formation at
the time of his early death. Gendzier traces the emergence of Fanon&rsquo;s
ideas, in particular looking in detail at the influence of Sartre. In
his book <B>Anti-Semite and Jew</B> Sartre had attempted to analyse
the psychology of the Anti-Semite: &lsquo;He is a man who is afraid.
Not of the Jews, to be sure, but of himself, of his own
consciousness, of his liberty, of his instincts, of his
responsibilities, of solitariness, of change, of society, and of the
world &ndash; of everything except the Jews ... Anti-Semitism, in
short, is fear of the human condition. The anti-Semite is a man who
wishes to be pitiless stone, a furious torrent, a devastating
thunderbolt &ndash; anything except a man.&rsquo; (The point is made
without the obscure jargon into which Sartre often lapses in his
short story <I>Childhood of a Leader</I>.)</P>
<P>From this starting point Fanon developed some important insights
into the ideological aspects of racialism and black consciousness:
&lsquo;It is the white man who creates the Negro. But it is the Negro
who creates negritude.&rsquo; But while Fanon&rsquo;s strength is in
his concern with consciousness, his weakness derives from his
tendency to see ideas out of a material context.</P>
<P>Hence his approach to the French Left &ndash; a moral criticism
for failing to pull their weight, rather than an attempt to
demonstrate the common interests of French workers and Algerian
peasants. Hence his grotesque description of the colonial proletariat
as &lsquo;pampered&rsquo;. Hence the flight into mysticism that sees
violence as a &lsquo;cleansing force&rsquo;.</P>
<P>In an interesting final chapter Gendzier discusses Fanon&rsquo;s
influence in independent Algeria, and quotes an Algerian official who
argues it is necessary to &lsquo;deFanonize Algeria&rsquo;. Fanon&rsquo;s
independent and original thought is too much for the men who now rule
Algeria; but it is unlikely to be the main inspiration for those who
will overthrow them.</p>
