<p class="fst"><strong>The French Communist Party <em>versus</em> the Students</strong><br />
Richard Johnson<br />
<em>Yale University Press, &#163;0.85</em></p>

<p class="fst">Over the last 20 years, there has been a flood of American historical and sociological studies of the European labour movement. The aim was two-fold &#8211; the Cold War struggle against Communist ideas and the need to understand the traditions of working-class organisation in countries where US-based multi-nationals were establishing their plants. Nonetheless, there was a serious standard of scholarship and books like Cammett&#8217;s <strong>Antonio Gramsci</strong> and Wohl&#8217;s <strong>French Communism in the Making</strong> can be read with profit by any socialist.</p>

<p>But bourgeois scholarship thrives on stability; it is allergic to the, sound of workers&#8217; feet on the streets. Though Johnson expresses a debt to the earlier generation of scholars, his book on the French CP, the students and the events of May 1968 is a mish-mash of pretentiousness and ignorance.</p>

<p>The bouregois world-view has two explanations for mass action &#8211; &#8216;outside&#8217; agitators and spontaneous irrationality. Johnson is not even consistent &#8211; on p.134 he tells us about the &#8216;seven types&#8217; of Communist agitator (identified in the Iraqi riots of 1947-48 by one Eugene Methvin), while on p.153 student self-defence against riot police becomes displaced &#8216;aggression toward the overbearing parent&#8217;.</p>

<p>As for the French CP, Johnson sees it as controlled by &#8216;proletarian <em>apparatchiki</em>&#8217;, who stifle the bourgeois intellectuals out of an &#8216;innate feeling of cultural inferiority&#8217;. Johnson&#8217;s scrupulous use of class categories is shown by the fact that he lists as a &#8216;bourgeois intellectual&#8217; the Italian Communist Gramsci, who scarcely had a square meal in his life. It would be churlish to add that the systematic misspelling of French names suggests that Johnson&#8217;s knowledge of French isn&#8217;t up to reading most of the books in his bibliography.</p>

<p>If you want to know about the French CP and intellectuals, read despite its limitations &#8211; David Caute&#8217;s <strong>Communism and the French Intellectuals</strong>, but if you want to know about the decline of American scholarship, read this book.</p>
