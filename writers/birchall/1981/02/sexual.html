<h2>Ian Birchall</h2>

<h1>Take the trouble</h1>

<h3>(February 1981)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Review</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/socrev/index1.html#sr81_02" target="new">1981&nbsp;:&nbsp;2</a>, 16 February&ndash;19 March 1981, p.&nbsp;30.<br />
Transcribed &amp; marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst">Anti-gay prejudice is disgusting and reactionary, and any sign of it in a revolutionary organisation should be firmly stamped on. But before the Manchester SWP Gay Group (<strong>SR</strong> 1981:1) start keeping files on comrades&#8217; alleged lapses, they should take the trouble to read what was actually written.</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>They claim that in <strong>Socialist Worker</strong> 711 I linked &#8216;sodomy (and therefore homosexuality) with French capitalism.&#8217; I linked nothing. I <em>quoted</em> a remark by Coluche, a clown who is running for the French presidency. I don&#8217;t in fact believe Coluche&#8217;s remark was anti-gay (anal intercourse may be homosexual or heterosexual), but in any case I felt it was quite legitimate to give a quotation &#8211; clearly labelled as such &#8211; of a typical comment from Coluche. After all <strong>SW</strong> in the past has quoted Thatcher and Martin Webster.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>It is claimed that in <a href="../../1980/11/raven.html" target="new">my article on Simon Raven</a> (<strong>SR</strong> 1980&nbsp;:&nbsp;10) I &#8216;equated&#8217; homosexuality with self-indulgence. I did nothing of the sort. I stated that Raven was gay and self-indulgent. (Anyone who reads <strong>The English Gentleman</strong> or the semi-autobiographical <strong>Fielding Gray</strong> can check the truth of this.) If I had said Idi Amin was a brutal black dictator would I be accused of generalising about all blacks? What I tried to argue in the article was that although Raven portrays his gay characters in a sympathetic light, their homosexuality is never allowed to challenge the structures of the existing order.<br />
&#160;</li>

<li>They have totally misinterpreted a passing &#8211; and perhaps too flippant &#8211; comment in <a href="../../1980/12/stalin.html" target="new">my piece on Stalinism</a>. (<strong>SR</strong> 1980&nbsp;:&nbsp;11) It was certainly never my intention to criticise masturbation as such. (If I had referred to people hanging pictures of Stalin on their walls, would Manchester SWP Art-Lovers Group have written to complain I was against painting?) Nor do I have any desire to censure anybody&#8217;s fantasies. But do the letter&#8217;s writers really believe that all fantasies are equally good? Surely we condemn fantasies about, say, the Yorkshire Ripper &#8211; and the porn merchants and millionaire publishers who get rich encouraging such fantasies. And Stalin killed far more people than the Ripper. All I was seeking to criticise was the distortion of sexuality that was one &#8211; small &#8211; component of the fascination of Stalin for a generation of the left. The comment was not anti-gay &#8211; Stalin had as many female fans as male. And it was not ageist: it&#8217;s simply a fact that the generation that loved Stalin are now getting on in years &#8211; they were worse when they were younger.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">There are a lot of questions about sexual politics that the SWP still needs to work on. The current debate on paedophilia in <strong>Socialist Review</strong>, for example, has scarcely scratched the surface of the problem. But the kind of discussion we need will not be helped by misquotation and unfounded accusation.</p>
