<p class="fst">Jay Woolrich is quite wrong to read my <a href="../09/naville.html" target="new">obituary</a> of Pierre Naville
as an attack on Andr&#233; Breton. Breton&#8217;s record, as a poet and
theoretician of revolutionary art, is an admirable one. But
admiration for Breton should not lead us to ignore the problems posed
by his political evolution.</p>

<p>It was not Breton who led the surrealists towards Communism; it
was Naville who pointed the way. And Breton was much slower than
Naville to recognise the rise of Stalinism. Breton was never a member
of any Trotskyist organisation. The real issue was not the
independence of surrealism, but the fact that Breton tried to make
the surrealist group into a political organisation in its own right.</p>

<p>There is no simple formula, in Trotsky&#8217;s works or elsewhere, for
the relation of artists to revolutionary politics. Artists who
involve themselves in revolutionary politics will necessarily be torn
by a contradiction between competing obligations &#8211; a contradiction
that cannot be resolved this side of the revolution. Such figures as
Sartre, Serge, Brecht and Gorky show different &#8211; but partial &#8211;
responses to the contradiction. Once that is understood we can learn
from both Naville and Breton.</p>
