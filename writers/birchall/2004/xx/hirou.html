<p class="fst"><strong>Jean-Pierre Hirou</strong><br />
<em>Du trotskysme au communisme libertaire</em><br />
Editions Acratie, La Bussi&#232;re 2003, pp.&#160;279, &#1028;25</p>

<p class="fst">JEAN-PIERRE Hirou, whose <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/revhist/backiss/vol8/no2/crawford2.html" target="new">obituary</a> appeared in <strong>Revolutionary History</strong>, Volume 8, no.&#160;2 (2002), joined <em>Voix ouvri&#232;re</em>, the predecessor of <em>Lutte ouvri&#232;re</em>, in 1963 at the age of 15, and soon became a regular contributor to the organisation&#8217;s paper. He and his partner Mich&#232;le left LO in 1979, and he subsequently called himself a &#8216;libertarian communist&#8217;, though he never again joined an organisation. He was best known for his insightful book on the pre-1914 French left, <strong>Parti socialiste ou CGT? (1905&#8211;1914)</strong> (Editions Acratie, 1995), which savagely undermines some widespread myths about the pre-1914 French left. He died at the shockingly early age of 53. His comrades have edited this collection of articles and letters as a tribute to his memory and as a contribution to continuing debates on the left.</p>

<p>The first section, consisting of articles published in <strong>Lutte ouvri&#232;re</strong>, is the least interesting. The articles, mainly on international and historical topics, are of the sort to be found in the left press the world over &#8211; clear, well-researched commentaries on current events, but basically second-hand accounts with few new insights. Since Hirou was a member of a tendency that considers innovatory analyses of the world as petit-bourgeois self-indulgence, this is no surprise. Many of the articles end with the familiar refrain that a revolutionary party is absent &#8211; undoubtedly true, but equally undoubtedly inadequate. However, the article on socialist election strategy before 1914 shows a scholarship rare in this kind of left journalism, while a piece on child torture reveals a controlled anger that gives us a glimpse of what made Hirou a revolutionary in the first place.</p>

<p>The latter part shows Hirou in a much more free-thinking mode. However, anyone looking for revelations about the inner life of <em>Lutte ouvri&#232;re</em> will be disappointed. In recent years a flood of articles have appeared in France concerned to &#8216;expose&#8217; LO&#8217;s effective leader, Hardy (Robert Barcia). Hirou had the elementary decency not to contribute to this process; while he knew that there are grave problems with LO, they were very different from the ones pointed to by ignorant and sensation-seeking journalists. In some ways he remained attached to LO; he supported Arlette Laguiller&#8217;s election campaigns, and noted that LO had, in general, made far smaller concessions to social democracy than either the <em>Ligue Communiste R&#233;volutionnaire</em> or the Lambertistes. He was clearly deeply hurt at not being allowed to present his book to a forum at the LO f&#234;te. He took a deep interest in the various small splits from LO, hoping to engage them in political dialogue. But he was strongly critical of Hardy&#8217;s authoritarian style of leadership, and from his new, &#8216;libertarian&#8217; standpoint, he regarded LO as being essentially centrist.</p>

<p>Hirou was a student in the period leading up to May 1968, and he has some interesting recollections of the movement. His memory of Daniel Cohn-Bendit at Nanterre in 1966, failing to sell a single copy of his magazine, will give a spark of hope to all frustrated paper-sellers. And he recalls something of which I for one had hitherto been unaware, that in June 1968 LO proposed to other far left groups that they should run a joint slate of candidates in the general elections. The idea came to nothing as everybody else was denouncing bourgeois elections. At the time, I should undoubtedly have rejected LO&#8217;s proposal, but in retrospect I think that LO were right; a revolutionary election campaign could have given a focus to the far left as the movement disintegrated.</p>

<p>Some of Hirou&#8217;s judgements of more recent events are more dubious. Thus he repeatedly refers to what he calls &#8216;Islamic&#8217; fascism. This is not the playground abuse of a Hitchens or an Aaronovitch; he invokes the work of Daniel Gu&#233;rin, whom he admired greatly, in support of his stance. Yet nowhere does he effectively make his case for believing that, for example, Osama bin Laden can meaningfully be described as a &#8216;fascist&#8217;. There are undoubtedly some very nasty Islamic fundamentalists, but many of them are hiding in caves while the equally nasty Christian fundamentalists are sitting in the Pentagon with nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>On his specialist area of French labour history, Hirou is much more perceptive. It is particularly good to read his devastating critique of Jaur&#232;s, a name still much admired on the reformist left. As Hirou argues, it was only the assassin&#8217;s bullet that saved Jaur&#232;s from joining Guesde and Herv&#233; in support for the First World War. Like Charles Kennedy, Jaur&#232;s was against war until the fighting actually started: &#8216;Jaur&#232;s always clearly anticipated that his tactical &#8220;pacifism&#8221; would turn into fierce strategic warmongering as soon as a foreign army had crossed the frontier.&#8217; Hirou claims that both Trotsky and Luxemburg (impressed by Jaur&#232;s&#8217; powerful intelligence and formidable oratory) had illusions in him, and only Lenin clearly evaluated him for what he was.</p>

<p>But whatever specific agreements or divergences one may have, Hirou&#8217;s book shows an active mind using the past to understand the present and prepare the future. Today, as in the early years of the Comintern, the border-line between Marxism and &#8216;ultra-leftism&#8217; of various varieties is becoming the locus of crucial debates in the movement. All the more pity that Hirou is not with us to contribute to them.</p>
