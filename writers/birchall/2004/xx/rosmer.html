<p class="fst">In 1952 George Allen and Unwin published Tony Cliff&#8217;s first
book, <strong>Stalin&#8217;s Satellites in Europe</strong> (under his real name,
Ygael Gluckstein), in which he applied the theory of state capitalism
to the &#8216;people&#8217;s democracies&#8217; of Eastern Europe. The work was
an extension of his 1950 document <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1950/07/index.htm" target="new"><em>On the Class Nature of the &#8220;People&#8217;s Democracies&#8221;</em></a>. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> The following year the book was published in French by the &#235;les d&#8217;or publishing house, which specialised in critical studies of Communism.</p>

<p class="fst">In November 1953 Cliff&#8217;s book <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/rosmer/1953/xx/cliff.html" target="new">was reviewed</a> in the French journal <strong>Preuves</strong> by Alfred Rosmer. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> Rosmer was a veteran of the movement. A revolutionary syndicalist, he had been one of the few to
oppose the First World War from the first day. After the war he
played a leading role in the Communist International and the Red
International of Labour Unions. He was expelled from the French
Communist Party in 1924, was for a time a Trotskyist, and remained a
close friend of Trotsky even after his political break with
Trotskyism. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p><strong>Preuves</strong> was the journal of the Congress for Cultural
Freedom, parallel to <strong>Encounter</strong> in Britain. This was a pro-US
and anti-Communist outfit, but in France especially it sought to give
itself credibility on the left by associating with anti-Stalinist
leftists. It was only in 1967 that it became public that it was
financed by the CIA. (The Communist Party had made accusations
earlier, but since they also accused <strong>Preuves</strong> of being &#8216;fascist&#8217;,
which it certainly was not, their criticisms were not taken seriously
outside their own ranks.) Rosmer had some rather loose links with
<strong>Preuves</strong> in the early 1950s, although by 1954 he seems to have
resumed a fully non-aligned position. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p>Rosmer already knew of Cliff&#8217;s work. In 1949 the Cuban
Trotskyist Group wrote a letter to the French journal <strong>Socialisme
ou barbarie</strong> (which had recently split from the Fourth
International on a state capitalist basis) urging them to study
Cliff&#8217;s <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1948/stalruss/index.htm" target="new">1948 internal document</a> on Russia. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> It went on to state
that Rosmer was translating Cliff&#8217;s document into French, though
nothing seems to have come of this. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> However, it is clear that
Cliff&#8217;s work was making some impact on the international movement.</p>

<p>Cliff recalls in his autobiography that he met Rosmer when he
visited Britain <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a>, but there is no reference to Rosmer&#8217;s review,
of which I have never seen mention previously. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p>That Cliff&#8217;s work should have been recommended by Rosmer, one of
the veterans of the Communist movement, and a man universally
recognised for his honesty, integrity and commitment to workers&#8217;
democracy, is itself significant. But Rosmer&#8217;s review is very
perceptive. He begins by referring to the show trials and executions
of Slansky and Clementis in Czechoslovakia, but concludes by
identifying the central strength in Cliff&#8217;s analysis.</p>

<p>In the circles around <strong>Preuves</strong> it was common to describe
Russia and the East European states as &#8216;totalitarian&#8217;. While this
identified the regimes as oppressive, it said little about the
dynamics of their development. By insisting that they were
capitalist, Cliff was also asserting that the oppressed were not
slaves but workers, that they would rebel just as workers had done in
the West, and that they would emancipate themselves rather than
requiring &#8216;liberation&#8217; from the Western powers.</p>

<p>To Rosmer, who had been politically active since the Dreyfus Case
of the 1890s, and who had seen over 50 years of ups and downs,
Cliff&#8217;s optimism seemed wholly plausible. In fact even before
Rosmer&#8217;s review appeared, East Berlin building workers had launched
a revolt in June 1953, to be followed in 1956 by the massive risings
of Polish and Hungarian workers. For Cliff, as for Rosmer, it was
workers&#8217; capacity for self-emancipation that was paramount.</p>
