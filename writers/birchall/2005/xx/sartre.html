<p class="fst">This year&#8217;s centenary of the birth of Jean-Paul Sartre will be
an ambiguous affair. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> In France, and even in Britain, there will
be academic conferences and articles in the more intellectually
inclined papers and magazines. But enthusiasm will be distinctly
restrained. As Lenin pointed out long ago, the bourgeoisie tries to
convert dead revolutionaries into &#8216;harmless icons&#8217;. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> But
Sartre &#8211; like Lenin himself &#8211; remains resistant to conversion. It
is scarcely possible to deny that he was both a great writer and an
important philosopher, but his political commitment still sticks in
the throats of our rulers and their intellectual errand-boys.</p>

<p>His steadfast opposition to French colonialism in Algeria and
American imperialism in Vietnam has all too many echoes for today&#8217;s
occupation of Iraq. His insistence on the unity of theory and
practice is anathema to the postmodernists, for whom the rejection of
the &#8216;unitary subject&#8217; provides the ideal alibi for intellectual
and political inconsistency. Even on the socialist left some will try
to prove their political virility by stressing their differences with
Sartre rather than what they have in common. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> So we can expect
tributes to Sartre to be qualified with quibbles about his role
during the German Occupation <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a>, and above all with the claim that
he was a supporter of Russian Stalinism.</p>

<p>Back in the 1950s and 1960s things looked very different. For
those of us who discovered Sartre in the aftermath of the political
crises of 1956 (Suez and Hungary), his plays and novels reflected on
the one hand alienation and the loneliness of individual freedom, on
the other a demand for responsibility, commitment and action. It was
a potent combination at a moment when the old certainties of
Stalinist Marxism had crumbled forever, and a new left was still
struggling to be born. In France Sartre&#8217;s opposition to the
Algerian War made him a hero for those campaigning against the war,
many of whom went on to be leaders of the student revolt in 1968. In
the 1960s Sartre and Bertrand Russell, the two most renowned living
philosophers, albeit from very different traditions, came together to
oppose the Vietnam War. They inspired many thousands of young people
who joined the anti-war movement, and in May 1968 Sartre backed the
insurgent French students from the very first day. In the aftermath
of 1968, when he sold banned socialist newspapers on the streets to
defy the state <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> and addressed a meeting outside the Renault car
factory, he seemed to embody the hope that Marxist theory and
revolutionary practice were coming together for the first time since
the 1920s.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Sartre&#8217;s century</h4>

<p class="fst">Even the French so called &#8216;new philosopher&#8217; Bernard-Henri
L&#233;vy, hostile to Sartre&#8217;s politics, calls the 20th century
Sartre&#8217;s century. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> He was born in the year of the Russian &#8216;dress
rehearsal&#8217; revolution of 1905 into a bourgeois family; one of his
earliest political memories was of the Russian Revolution of 1917. He
died just before the rise of Solidarnosc in Poland in 1980. His
lifetime covers the historical epoch stretching from the birth of
Leninism to the death of Stalinism. Sartre witnessed the great events
of his lifetime, commented on most of them, and took part in a number
of them. He lived through a period marked by violence and social upheaval.</p>

<p>He had a successful academic career in the inter-war years,
studying in Berlin in 1933&#8211;1934, but scarcely seeming to notice the
Nazi regime. He was then best known for his novel, <strong>Nausea</strong>
(1938). In 1940 he was taken prisoner by the German army, and spent
time in a prisoner of war camp, where he wrote his first play. Later
he returned to France and briefly attempted to organise a resistance
grouping, Socialism and Liberty. In 1943 he published his first major
philosophical work, <strong>Being and Nothingness</strong>.</p>

<p>After the war he became famous with several plays and novels; he
launched the monthly journal <strong>Les Temps modernes</strong>, which was
intended to publish political and literary material from an
independent left standpoint. He was involved in the launch of the
RDR, a movement that stood for a socialism independent of both
Washington and Moscow. When this collapsed, Sartre moved for a time
very close to the French Communist Party (PCF), though he preserved
his political independence. But in 1956 he violently denounced the
Russian invasion of Hungary, and broke his links with the PCF. In
1964 he refused the Nobel Prize.</p>

<p>The years 1939&#8211;1962, in which most of Sartre&#8217;s major work was
produced, were a period of almost uninterrupted violent conflict for
his native land. The German Occupation gave way almost immediately to
national liberation struggles, first in Indochina, then in Algeria.
The centrality of violence in Sartre&#8217;s work cannot be detached from
this context. The question of racism, a central issue in the politics
of the 20th century, was of great importance to Sartre. His 1946 book
<strong>Anti-Semite and Jew</strong> attempted to give a psychological and
political explanation of anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>But if it is clear that Sartre&#8217;s work is deeply rooted in the
events of his own time, is he relevant to the 21st century? For most
of his life Sartre believed that the solution to the problems of
humanity must consist in some sort of socialist reorganisation of
society. For those who believe that the very idea of socialism is
obsolete, Sartre&#8217;s work can have little value other than as purely
aesthetic documents. Many would be only too glad to let Sartre&#8217;s
corpse fester under the ruins of the Berlin Wall. But for those of us
who believe that socialism &#8211; stripped of the monstrous deformations
of Stalinism &#8211; still offers hope to humanity, Sartre&#8217;s work
belongs not just to the 20th century, but also to the 21st.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Existentialism</h4>

<p class="fst">Sartre first became famous &#8211; or notorious &#8211; as the
representative of the philosophy of existentialism. He did not choose
the label; it was imposed on him. He was often caricatured as being a
pessimistic philosopher, a gloomy figure who dwelt on the most
squalid and miserable aspects of human existence. And some of his
statements seem to justify such criticism. His novel, <strong>Nausea</strong>,
depicts a young writer confronted by the absurdity of existence, the
realisation that in a godless universe nothing has any meaning. It
contains the statement: &#8216;Every existing thing is born without
reason, prolongs itself out of weakness, and dies by chance.&#8217; <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></p>

<p>Sartre&#8217;s attack on conventional moral values and his defence of
the oppressed made him a natural enemy for those on the political
right. In the 1950s the young Jean-Marie Le Pen declared that &#8216;France
is ruled by homosexuals: Sartre, Camus, Mauriac&#8217;. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a> Sartre&#8217;s
main philosophical work, <strong>Being and Nothingness</strong>, is several
hundred pages long and frequently obscure, and it is not altogether
surprising that Sartre&#8217;s philosophy was often misunderstood.
However, some sections convey their message vividly, notably the
section on what Sartre called &#8216;bad faith&#8217; (the strategies we
adopt to evade responsibility for our own freedom), with its
portraits, almost like short stories, of the caf&#233; waiter and the
woman unsure how to respond to her lover&#8217;s advances.</p>

<p>A closer study of Sartre&#8217;s thought makes it clear that what
characterises it above all is a vigorous and indeed scandalous
optimism. Sartre acknowledged this in his 1945 lecture
<em>Existentialism and Humanism</em>, saying of his critics:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Their excessive protests [against existentialism] make me
suspect that what is annoying them is not so much our pessimism but,
much more likely, our optimism ... What is alarming in the doctrine
... is ... that it confronts man with a possibility of choice. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The most fundamental assertion of Sartrean philosophy is that we
are condemned to be free &#8211; free in all circumstances. Even with a
gun held against my head, I can choose to resist &#8211; and die. Since
we are free, we make the world &#8211; there are no external obstacles
other than those we determine by the choice of our own projects. We
are responsible for the world as it is &#8211; and free to make it other
if we so choose. For Sartre there is no human nature: human society
is something quite independent of the laws of nature. Hence society
does not have to be as it is; it is possible to change the world.
Each of us is free to accept or reject our condition in the world;
even if we fail, we are always free to rebel. The laws of the economy
are quite different from meteorological laws, since they result from
human choice. There is no such thing as an &#8216;economic climate&#8217;.</p>

<p>Thus in <strong>Being and Nothingness</strong> Sartre argues that
&#8216;destruction is an essentially human thing and ... it is man who
destroys his cities through the agency of earthquakes&#8217;. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a>
Earthquakes are a human creation. If there were no human beings, an
earthquake would be a purely meaningless movement of matter. It
becomes a catastrophe only when it comes up against the human project
of building a city. Sartre&#8217;s point is very relevant to the recent
tsunami. This was not a simple &#8216;natural disaster&#8217; or an &#8216;act of
god&#8217;; the disaster was very largely the product of poverty,
inadequate precautions and the fact that warning systems were too expensive.</p>

<p>The central theme of all Sartre&#8217;s work is the question of the
unity of theory and practice. Sartre&#8217;s whole philosophy is geared
to the fact of human action; it centres on the question of values,
and hence is a highly moral philosophy, even though Sartre disavows
any kind of conventional moralising. This sets him firmly in
opposition to postmodernism, which is based on a quite willing
disjunction of theory and practice, leading to a fatalistic attitude
towards both knowledge and action.</p>

<p>This concern for the unity of theory and practice led Sartre to
become less interested in pure philosophy or pure literature, and
more directly interested in political questions. For Sartre writing
was not an activity separate from other human practices that could be
judged only by its own standards. In 1964 he caused great
consternation when he stated in an interview that &#8216;alongside a
dying child, <strong>Nausea</strong> does not make the weight&#8217;. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> That he
should put Third World starvation and a novel in the same scales
seemed outrageous to many people. But such a comparison is central to
Sartre&#8217;s whole worldview.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Sartre and Marxism</h4>

<p class="fst">Sartre&#8217;s concern with political action brought him into dialogue
with Marxism. This was not only a dialogue with the intellectuals of
the French Communist Party such as Roger Garaudy and Jean Kanapa, but
also with a number of independent anti-Stalinist Marxists such as
Pierre Naville, Claude Lefort and Daniel Gu&#232;rin. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p>In 1960 Sartre published the <strong>Critique of Dialectical Reason</strong>,
in which he proposed to reconcile existentialism with Marxism. It is
a very long and difficult work; perhaps if Sartre had been less
famous, his publisher might have sent him away to cut it to half the
length, which might have been a great improvement. He never completed
the second volume, and he certainly failed to resolve all the
theoretical questions he had posed. But it does contain some very
illuminating passages, notably the section on the bus queue and the
storming of the Bastille discussed below.</p>

<p>For me, the question of whether Sartre was a Marxist does not seem
very important &#8211; indeed, such questions easily become almost
theological. What is important are the questions that Sartre asks
about Marxism, the challenges he puts to Marxists. (In general Sartre
is more interesting for the questions he asks than for the answers he
gives.) Certainly in the period after 1956, when many Communist
intellectuals in France and elsewhere broke with Stalinism and
started looking for ways to renew Marxism, Sartre made an important
contribution to the rebirth of Marxism as a critical and radical
method of thought rather than a sterile dogmatism.</p>

<p>For Sartre one of the most important questions was the place of
the individual human being in the Marxist explanation of the
historical process. This had long been a preoccupation of Sartre, but
it acquired additional relevance in the crisis of Marxism after 1956.
In 1956 the Russian leader Khrushchev had given his so called &#8216;secret
speech&#8217; in which he denounced the crimes of Stalin. But
Khrushchev&#8217;s account was very much a psychological account. It is
undoubtedly true that Stalin was an extremely unpleasant and brutal
person &#8211; what Khrushchev did not and could not explain was why such
an unpleasant individual had become all-powerful in a so called
workers&#8217; state.</p>

<p>In the introduction to the <strong>Critique of Dialectical Reason</strong>
Sartre discussed Marxist literary criticism and the ways in which
Marxist critics had analysed the French poet Val&#233;ry. As he put it,
&#8216;Val&#233;ry is a petty bourgeois intellectual, no doubt about it. But
not every petty bourgeois intellectual is Val&#233;ry.&#8217; <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a> It is
important to point out that Sartre was not innovating here, but
rather reviving a current in Marxism which had been suppressed by
Stalinism. At the time of the rise of Hitler Leon Trotsky had
written, &#8216;Not every exasperated petty bourgeois could have become
Hitler, but an article of Hitler is lodged in every exasperated petty
bourgeois.&#8217; <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p>By raising the question of the role of the individual in Marxism,
Sartre asked important questions for political practice which had
been neglected in the classic Marxist tradition. Marx argued that
class struggle was the motor of history; Lenin contended that a
revolutionary party was necessary for the conquest of state power.
But neither of them posed the existential question &#8216;Why should <em>I</em>
join, why should <em>I</em> get involved?&#8217;</p>

<p>Sartre thus came into conflict with the deterministic philosophy
that was current in the French Communist Party. In a polemic against
Sartre, Roger Garaudy wrote a passage in which he denied that he
exercised any free choice, or that he had any responsibility for his
own actions:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I AM A COMMUNIST WITHOUT ANGUISH. First of all because I
didn&#8217;t choose to be a Communist. I didn&#8217;t choose it because it is
not for me to deny the reality of the internal contradictions of
capitalism, of its crises and of the class struggle which is the
motor of its development. Since the day when the analyses of <strong>Capital</strong>
taught me the dialectic of history, I have found myself faced by a
compelling force. And at no moment have I the choice between Marxism
and those who deny it. I should gladly say, as Luther did to his
judges: &#8216;Here I stand: I can do no other.&#8217; <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>

<p class="fst">That Garaudy himself began as an orthodox Communist, became a
dissident Communist, then a Christian and finally a Muslim shows that
the explanation of individual conduct through historical laws is not
so easy.</p>

<p>Here again Sartre was not saying anything new. Rather he was
counterposing the genuine Marxist tradition to the crude determinism
of the Stalinist tradition. He quoted with approval the position
argued by Engels that &#8216;men make their own history, but in a given
environment by which they are conditioned&#8217;. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p>Sartre developed his view that we are not the products of our
circumstances, but that we choose ourselves within our given
circumstances, in various biographical studies. Jean Genet was born
illegitimate, abandoned at birth and farmed out to a peasant family;
he soon found himself in a juvenile penal colony. He might have
seemed condemned to a life of crime on the margins of society;
instead he became one of the finest writers of his generation. Sartre
attempted to resolve this enigma in his book <strong>Saint Genet</strong>
(1952). Later he spent many years on a biographical study of the 19th
century novelist Flaubert, designed to develop in concrete fashion
the themes of the <strong>Critique of Dialectical Reason</strong>. Flaubert was
born into the middle class, yet instead of becoming a doctor or
lawyer like other members of his family he became a writer. Sartre
traces this back to his childhood slowness in learning to read. Yet
at the same time he analyses what it meant to choose to be a writer
at this time, examining ideas of literature in the post-Romantic
period. Sartre never completed the study, <strong>The Family Idiot</strong>,
but he provided a fascinating example of what biographical writing
involved. (He was, incidentally, strongly influenced by Isaac
Deutscher&#8217;s biography of Trotsky.)</p>

<p>Sartre&#8217;s concern for the role of the individual led him to
confront the question of morality. In 1947&#8211;1948 he wrote a
manuscript of over 600 pages on the question. He never completed it
to his satisfaction, and it was published only after his death. Here
he argues that the question of morality cannot be evaded: if we
attempt to exclude it from our analyses, it returns in one way or
another. As Sartre points out, the PCF had a private and a public
doctrine. In the manuals of Marxist theory capitalists acted
according to immutable historical and economic laws, but in the pages
of the party&#8217;s daily newspaper, <strong>L&#8217;Humanit&#233;</strong>, employers
were described as &#8216;wicked&#8217;. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a> At the same time Sartre insists
that morality is not autonomous, that it is impossible to impose
universal moral standards in a world in which human beings live in a
situation of gross inequality. It would only be possible to have a
real morality in a world where all human beings found themselves in
an equal situation; in the meantime the most important moral
imperative is to change the world.</p>

<p>The question of morality is therefore tied up with the question of
history. In his discussion of ends and means, Sartre rejected the
idea, held by some Marxists, that history has a pre-given end, which
it is possible to know, and towards which the historical process is
making its way. For Sartre there is no pre-given end to history &#8211;
how history develops will depend on human action and human choice.
Thus he wrote during the Second World War, &#8216;Tomorrow, after my
death, some men may decide to establish fascism, and the others may
be so cowardly or so slack as to let them do so. If so, fascism will
then be the truth of man, and so much the worse for us. In reality,
things will be such as men have decided they shall be.&#8217; <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p>Today it is very clear that not only can we not talk about an
inevitable future, we do not have any certainty that, in human terms,
there will be a future at all. In his last play, <em>Altona</em>,
Sartre gave a vision of the world in the 30th century, when humanity
had disappeared and the only beings able to judge the history of
humanity were a court of crabs. Sartre was thinking of nuclear war,
but the crabs could well be swimming in the waters that will have
overwhelmed our cities after centuries of global warming.</p>

<p>Here again, Sartre stands in the classic Marxist tradition, the
tradition of Karl Marx, who wrote that each stage of the class
struggle leads either to a new and higher form of society, or to the
&#8216;common ruin of the contending classes&#8217;. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> As Rosa Luxemburg
put it, &#8216;socialism or barbarism&#8217;.</p>

<p>Sartre was also very much concerned with the question of
collective action. In his play <em>In Camera</em> three people are
brought together in a hotel room &#8211; a Latin American radical
journalist, a snooty upper class woman who has killed her baby and an
aggressively working class lesbian (the true heroine of the play).
Slowly they realise that they are all dead, and that they only have
each other to give meaning to their past existence. The play contains
what is perhaps the best known quotation from Sartre: &#8216;Hell is
other people.&#8217; <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a> But Sartre does not argue that human beings are
inevitably in conflict with each other and that collective action is
impossible. He notes the fact that it is very difficult to achieve.
This puts him in opposition to the rhetoric of the PCF in the 1940s
and 1950s, which presented the working class as an already formed
collective which could be counted on to act in a united and cohesive
fashion, a collective generally seen as identical with the Communist
Party or the trade unions under its control, a rhetoric which
announced that, for example, &#8216;the working class will not permit&#8217;
certain policies.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Critique of Dialectical Reason</strong> Sartre argued that
human groups could take two different forms. On the one hand there
was seriality, of which he gave the example of the bus queue. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a> In
the bus queue a number of human beings come together in the same
physical space. They share the same objective &#8211; to get on the bus.
But because of scarcity &#8211; there are not enough places &#8211; each of
them opposes the interests of the others, each is an obstacle to the
aims of the others. But sometimes seriality is replaced by the &#8216;fused
group&#8217;. Here the example is the crowd storming the Bastille. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a>
Again human beings come together in the same physical space to pursue
the same aim. But this time, rather than each being an obstacle to
the other, nobody can achieve their aim without the assistance of the
others. I cannot storm the Bastille on my own.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Sartre, Stalinism and political action</h4>

<p class="fst">Sartre did not content himself with merely confronting Marxism on
the theoretical level. From 1945 onwards he made a consistent effort
to involve himself in political activity that was compatible with his principles.</p>

<p>Many of Sartre&#8217;s critics have attempted to discredit him by
claiming he was naive about Stalinism or even corrupted by it. The
recent study of Sartre by the former Maoist Bernard-Henri L&#233;vy is
based on total rejection of Communism in its very essence &#8211; &#8216;it
was revolution as such which was perverse and criminal&#8217;. For L&#233;vy
Communism is &#8216;that Sartrean passion, the object of his desire for
at least 30 years&#8217;. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a> The actual story of Sartre&#8217;s relations
with the USSR, the PCF and Communism is rather more complicated. He
made mistakes, some of which deserve vigorous criticism. But they
were mistakes made amid the difficulties of a multifaceted historical
period, and Sartre&#8217;s motivation was rather more complex than is
often suggested.</p>

<p>At the Liberation Sartre did not as yet see himself as a Marxist,
but he certainly used many ideas borrowed from Marxism. In October
1945 he decided to launch <strong>Les Temps modernes</strong> as a journal of
the independent left. Sartre was quite happy to co-operate with the
PCF, while at the same time maintaining a dialogue with other
Marxists and socialists. He recognised that the majority of French
workers felt an allegiance to the Communist Party, and considered
that the USSR, whatever its weaknesses, still at least aspired
towards socialism.</p>

<p>The PCF, however, saw Sartre&#8217;s popularity as a threat to its own
hegemony, especially over intellectuals and students. A flood of
books and articles were published to denounce Sartre and
existentialism. Roger Garaudy wrote a book about Sartre and others
entitled <strong>Gravediggers of Literature</strong> (1947). Sartre responded,
&#8216;Gravediggers are honest people, certainly unionised, perhaps
Communists. I&#8217;d rather be a gravedigger than a lackey.&#8217; <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a> He
was attacked by name by Stalin&#8217;s cultural policeman Zhdanov, and
<strong>Les Temps modernes</strong> was condemned by the same figure for
publishing the decadent work of Jean Genet. In 1952 complaints were
made at a meeting of the PCF Political Bureau that factory libraries
(run by factory committees controlled by the PCF-led CGT union
federation) were ordering a book by Sartre. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a></p>

<p>As the PCF attack got stronger Sartre began more and more to
stress his independence of both Washington and Moscow. In 1948 he wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">It would be strange if I were accused in New York of
anti-Americanism at the very moment when in Moscow <strong>Pravda</strong> is
denouncing me as an agent of American propaganda. If that did happen,
however, it would show one of two things &#8211; either that I am indeed
unhandy at my job, or that I am on the right track. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In 1948, at the time of the Communist take-over in Czechoslovakia
and the Berlin blockade, Sartre joined with the former Trotskyist
David Rousset, and various other activists from the social
democratic, non-Communist and Trotskyist left to form the
Rassemblement d&#233;mocratique r&#233;volutionnaire (Revolutionary
Democratic Assembly) (RDR). Its founding statement in February 1948
stressed independence of both blocs:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Between the rottenness of capitalist democracy, the
weaknesses and defects of a certain social democracy and the
limitation of Communism to its Stalinist form, we believe an assembly
of free men for revolutionary democracy is capable of giving new life
to the principles of freedom and human dignity by binding them to the
struggle for social revolution.</p>

<p class="fst">As Sartre put it in December 1948, &#8216;To refuse to choose between
the USSR and the US does not mean yielding first to the one, then to
the other, letting ourselves be tossed about between them. It means
making a positive choice: that of Europe, socialism and ourselves.&#8217; <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a></p>

<p>Initially the RDR seemed to have great potential, with large
meetings and many enthusiastic supporters. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a> But the bureaucracies
of the Socialist Party and the PCF succeeded in preventing its
further expansion. Then Rousset and other leaders moved more and more
towards a pro-American position. By the autumn of 1949 it had collapsed.</p>

<p>Rousset then launched a campaign against the labour camps in the
USSR. Sartre&#8217;s position on this question is often misrepresented.
Sartre did not deny the existence of the camps, as some PCF members
did. <strong>Les Temps Modernes</strong> published several articles, including
one by Victor Serge, about the Russian camps. In an editorial in
January 1950 Sartre and his fellow editor Merleau-Ponty declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">There is no socialism when one out of every 20 citizens
is in a camp ... Two years ago one of us wrote here that Soviet
society is ambiguous, and that both signs of progress and symptoms of
retrogression are found in it. If there are 10 million concentration
camp inmates &#8211; while at the other end of the Soviet hierarchy
salaries and standard of living are 15 to 20 times higher than those
of free workers &#8211; then quantity changes into quality. The whole
system swerves and changes meaning; and in spite of nationalisation
of the means of production, and even though private exploitation of
man by man and unemployment are impossible in the USSR, we wonder
what reasons we still have to speak of socialism in relation to it. <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a></p>

<p class="fst">However, Sartre refused to associate himself with Rousset&#8217;s
campaign because the latter had launched it in a right wing newspaper
&#8211; <strong>Le Figaro Litt&#233;raire</strong> &#8211; and refused to condemn
repressive regimes in the Western bloc, such as Greece and Spain.</p>

<p>However, Sartre now seems to have despaired of the possibility of
an independent left. He later claimed that before 1968 &#8216;there was
nothing to the left of the PCF&#8217;. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a> In fact his own writings show
that this was untrue. In the 1950s Sartre polemicised against Ernest
Mandel, Claude Lefort and Pierre Naville <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a>; he was certainly aware
of the existence of the Fourth International and of the <strong>Socialisme
ou barbarie</strong> grouping which argued that Russia was state capitalist.</p>

<p>In 1952, when the government was taking repressive measures
against the PCF at the time of mass demonstrations against General
Ridgway, the new head of NATO, Sartre announced his &#8216;agreement with
the Communists on certain precise and limited subjects, reasoning
from my principles and not from theirs&#8217;. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a> For four years Sartre
became &#8211; almost &#8211; the model fellow traveller. But his motivation
was not the totalitarian mentality which Bernard-Henri L&#233;vy
attributes to him, but a much more complex set of tactical considerations.</p>

<p>Firstly, as he had put it in 1947, &#8216;The majority of the
proletariat, strait-jacketed by a single party, encircled by a
propaganda which isolates it, forms a closed society without doors or
windows. There is only one way of access, a very narrow one, the
Communist Party.&#8217; <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a> The crucial fact about the Communist Party
for Sartre was not its doctrine nor its link to Russia, but the fact
that it had the votes of some 5 million workers and, through the CGT
union federation, led the best organised section of the working
class. And secondly Sartre&#8217;s alignment with the USSR was motivated
by Karl Liebknecht&#8217;s principle that for revolutionaries &#8216;the main
enemy is at home&#8217;. In a world divided into warring blocs, both of
them guilty of aggression, brutality and repression, Sartre insisted
that his first priority was to attack the crimes committed on his own side.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that Sartre, especially between 1952 and
1956, defended the indefensible in Russian society. In particular he
published five articles in <strong>Lib&#233;ration</strong> in which he took a
naively uncritical view of Russian society and made some appallingly
dishonest claims about the freedom of criticism permitted there. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a>
However, it should be added that Sartre&#8217;s concessions to Stalinism
were relatively small in comparison to those of some of his
contemporaries. He never wrote anything comparable to Brecht&#8217;s
defence of the Moscow Trials. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a> British writers like Raymond
Williams, Eric Hobsbawm <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a> and Edward Thompson <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a>, who made an
enormous contribution to Marxist understanding were, before 1956, far
more deeply implicated with Stalinism than Sartre ever was. In fact
his alliance with the PCF was short-lived. In 1956 Sartre denounced
the Russian intervention in Hungary, saying that socialism &#8216;is not
brought at bayonet point&#8217;. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a> But he denied the right of
criticism to those who had backed US imperialism in Guatemala in
1954, or who supported the Franco-British invasion of Egypt taking
place at that very moment.</p>

<p>But even before this break with the PCF Sartre&#8217;s position had
sharply diverged from that of the Communists over the war in Algeria.
As early as 1955 <strong>Les Temps modernes</strong> committed itself to a
course of opposition to the war that would soon run up against the
limits of legality. In October of that year an editorial statement
appeared under the title <em>Refusal to Obey</em>. This described
Algeria as a &#8216;colony&#8217; (rejecting the official fiction that it was
an integral part of France) subject to &#8216;the most obvious
exploitation&#8217;. It went on: &#8216;A war is starting in North Africa; it
is up to the government whether to stop it, or, on the contrary, to
make it inevitable ... To this war, we say no.&#8217; At this time almost
the only active campaigning against the war was coming from a handful
of anarchists and Trotskyists. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a> In 1956 the PCF voted in favour
of &#8216;special powers&#8217; for the government to deal with the situation
in Algeria.</p>

<p>Over the next few years, Sartre&#8217;s consistent anti-imperialism,
and his courage and outspokenness in the service of Algerian
independence, were an inspiration to a new generation who had been
radicalised by Algeria, and who were repelled by the role played by
the traditional left in the PCF and the SFIO. In September 1960
Sartre was one of the most prominent signatories of the celebrated
<em>Manifesto of the 121</em>, drafted by Maurice Blanchot and Maurice
Nadeau. (Nadeau had been a Trotskyist in the 1930s and 1940s and
close to surrealist circles.) The statement declared:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We respect and consider justified the refusal to take
arms against the Algerian people. We respect and consider justified
the actions of those French people who regard it as their duty to
offer assistance and protection to Algerians oppressed in the name of
the French people.</p>

<p class="fst">The PCF did not support the <em>Manifesto</em>. But it was signed by
Alfred Rosmer, a veteran opponent of the First World War, the
surrealist Andr&#233; Breton, the historian and anti-imperialist
campaigner Daniel Gu&#232;rin and others from the non-Stalinist left.</p>

<p>In 1968 Sartre, siding with the students against the authorities
from the very outset, denounced the PCF for its attitude, which he
said was not revolutionary and not even reformist. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a> His position
on Russia also became much firmer. After the Russian invasion of
Czechoslovakia he spoke of &#8216;Soviet imperialism&#8217; <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a>, while
saying that it followed different laws to US imperialism. He argued
that &#8216;it is impossible to reach socialism by starting from
Stalinism, for one will never reach anything except something whose
instrument has been Stalinism&#8217;. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a> In 1973, Sartre developed the
argument further by claiming that there was nothing specifically
socialist about nationalisation. If an enterprise was nationalised
while the capitalist structure was preserved, then what resulted was
&#8216;state capitalism&#8217;. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a></p>

<p>This was scarcely a man who worshipped Stalin or who was
essentially a totalitarian.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Sartre, violence and resistance</h4>

<p class="fst">One of Sartre&#8217;s most important articles is called <em>To Write
for One&#8217;s Own Age</em>. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a> The strength of Sartre&#8217;s work is that
it is rooted in the problems of his own age, and it is therefore
dangerous to try and argue what Sartre would have thought of the very
different world in which we live. Yet such speculation may have some
value. Sartre lived through an age of violence, and much of his
thought revolved around the question of violence. So it may be
interesting to enquire what Sartre might have thought of the war
against terrorism in our own day.</p>

<p>Sartre is often seen as an apologist for violence and terrorism.</p>

<p>Many of his critics recall his visit to Andreas Baader of the
armed German group, the Red Army Faction, in 1974. But Baader
scarcely felt that Sartre was a supporter. He commented, &#8216;I thought
I was dealing with a friend but they sent me a judge.&#8217; <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a></p>

<p>Sartre observed that throughout the course of history the holders
of power and privilege have not lightly abandoned their positions,
and that it has almost invariably been the case that they had to be
violently removed. Human history is, whether we like it or not, the
history of violence, and our present ills and privileges are rooted
in violence. Hence in Algeria, and later in Vietnam, he refused to
equate the violence of the oppressed with that of the oppressors. As
he wrote:</p>

<p class="quoteb">During the Algerian war I always refused to make a
parallel between the terrorist use of bombs, the only weapon
available to the Algerians, and the actions and extortions of a rich
army of half a million, which occupied the entire country. It&#8217;s the
same in Vietnam. <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The text often quoted to show Sartre&#8217;s support for violence is
his <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/1961/preface.htm" target="new">preface</a> to Fanon&#8217;s <strong>The Wretched of the Earth</strong>. The
language is angry and at times provocative, but time and again Sartre
repeats the point that the violence of the national liberation
struggle is a product of, a response to, the existing violence of colonialism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">For at first it is not their violence, it is ours, which
turns back on itself and rends them ... It is the moment of the
boomerang, it is the third phase of violence; it comes back on us, it
strikes us, and we do not realise any more than we did the other
times that it&#8217;s we that have launched it. We have sown the wind: he
[the peasant fighter] is the whirlwind ... If violence began this
very evening and if exploitation and oppression had never existed on
the earth, perhaps the slogans of non-violence might end the quarrel ... <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Sartre was first practically confronted with the questions of
violence and terrorism during the German occupation of France. The
PCF, like the Iraqi resistance today, had a policy of killing as many
occupying soldiers as possible. Often the PCF was in fact sending its
own members to a certain death, so there is a close parallel with
suicide bombers. Moreover, the Nazis executed hostages in response to
attacks by the French Resistance. Sartre commented in 1944 that when
he wrote <em>The Flies</em>, &#8216;the real drama, the drama I should have
liked to write, was that of the terrorist who by ambushing Germans
becomes the instrument for the execution of 50 hostages&#8217;. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a>
Though Sartre saw the necessity for armed resistance, he was not
entirely happy about the means advocated by the PCF.</p>

<p>One of the philosophical questions that preoccupied Sartre
throughout his life was that of ends and means. His most extensive
consideration of the problem occurs in the incomplete manuscript on
morality from 1948. Here he was heavily influenced by a reading of
Trotsky&#8217;s short book <strong>Their Morals and Ours</strong>, where Trotsky
rejects the formulation that the end justifies the means in favour of
an argument that there is a dialectical interrelation between ends
and means. Sartre&#8217;s formulation was very close to Trotsky&#8217;s. <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a>
As he put it later, &#8216;We are of those who say: the end justifies the
means; adding, however, this indispensable corrective: these means
define the end.&#8217; <a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a></p>

<p>So, for Sartre, the question exists on two levels. On one level
the violence of the oppressed may be justified by the greater
violence of the oppressor. But there is also the second question: the
effectiveness of terrorist methods in achieving the goal of a more
just society. Such a distinction is very relevant to today&#8217;s war on terror.</p>

<p>Sartre&#8217;s work does not give us a doctrine or a strategy in face
of today&#8217;s world. No organised political tendency can claim his
legacy. But in studying Sartre we see a man facing the problems of
his own age, a man grappling with the question of freedom and
responsibility, of morality and politics, of violence, of the
possibility of collective action. The way in which he asked the
questions may help those who are still seeking answers.</p>

<h4>Note on reading</h4>

<p class="fst">The main themes of Sartre&#8217;s work come across most powerfully in
his plays and novels. The best plays to read (or see if possible) are
<em>The Flies</em> (in which Sartre uses a Greek myth to condemn the
Nazi occupation), <em>In Camera</em> (where three dead souls form an
eternal triangle), <em>The Respectful Prostitute</em> (for which Sartre
was criticised for suggesting that there might be racism in the US!),
<em>Dirty Hands</em> (a political drama based on the assassination of
Trotsky), <em>Lucifer and the Lord</em> (a moral and political allegory
set in 16th century Germany), and <em>Nekrassov</em> (a satire of the
right wing press which still rings true today). There is a collection
of short stories entitled <strong>Intimacy</strong> (also published under the
title <strong>The Wall</strong>) in which <em>The Wall</em> (on the Spanish Civil
War) and <em>Childhood of a Leader</em> (on how a middle class
adolescent becomes a fascist) are particularly interesting. The three
novels of the <strong>Roads to Freedom</strong> trilogy (<strong>The Age of Reason</strong>,
<strong>The Reprieve</strong> and <strong>Iron in the Soul</strong>) give a fascinating
picture of France before and during the outbreak of the Second World
War, where a group of individuals are caught up by the historical
process and have to remake their lives.</p>

<p>Sartre&#8217;s major philosophical works tend to be very long and very
difficult. Sartre&#8217;s 1945 lecture <em>Existentialism and Humanism</em>
contains many oversimplifications, but is a useful introduction. It
also contains a confrontation with the Trotskyist Pierre Naville (who
organised the founding conference of the Fourth International).
<strong>Anti-Semite and Jew</strong> is a lucid and thought-provoking study of
the roots of racism. While the <strong>Critique of Dialectical Reason</strong>
is hard going, the opening section, published separately in English
as <strong>The Problem of Method</strong>, is fairly readable and introduces a
number of key problems.</p>

<p>Note that many of Sartre&#8217;s works have been published or
performed in English under several different titles. There are
various political articles and extracts from the <strong>Critique of
Dialectical Reason</strong> at <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/index.htm" target="new">www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre</a>.

<p class="note"><a href="#f4" name="n4">4.</a> In recent years a number of Sartre&#8217;s critics have raised
questions about his behaviour under the German occupation, for
example the fact that <em>The Flies</em> was first performed at a
theatre formerly named after the Jewish actress Sarah Bernhardt and
renamed by the German occupiers. Such criticisms generally come from
people of a later generation, who fail to realise that the
institutions of a fascist occupation cannot be boycotted like South
African oranges. To survive one had to compromise. In the immediate
post-war period Sartre worked with a number of people who had
impeccable Resistance records, and some of whom, like Claude Bourdet,
had been in German concentration camps. None of them questioned
Sartre&#8217;s conduct. Certainly he was not a Resistance hero &#8211; he
never claimed to be &#8211; but the attacks on his record seem to be
motivated by spite rather than fact.</p>
