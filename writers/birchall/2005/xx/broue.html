<p class="fst">Pierre Brou&#233; (1926&#8211;2005) who died in July, was one of the most
important historians in the revolutionary socialist tradition.</p>
<p>Brou&#233; became a Trotskyist in 1944. It was not an easy time.
Militants faced lethal danger not only from the Nazi occupiers of
France, but also from the Stalinist Communist Party. Towards the end
of his life he returned to his roots, publishing a book investigating
the deaths of Pietro Tresso and three other Trotskyists killed on
Stalinist orders in 1943.</p>

<p>Brou&#233; always remained true to his initial commitment. After the
splits of the early 1950s he remained for over 30 years in the group
led by Pierre Lambert. The experience was not without friction &#8211;
Brou&#233; once threw a chair at Lambert during a meeting &#8211; and ended
with his expulsion in 1989. Right up to his death he continued to
write on current issues for <strong>Le Marxisme aujourd&#8217;hui</strong>, which
he edited.</p>

<p>From his experience as an activist he got an understanding of the
dynamics of political organisations and their relations to the ups
and downs of class struggles that could never be grasped by a
historian who simply remained buried in the archives.</p>

<p>For many years Brou&#233; taught at the University of Grenoble. His
lectures were popular and inspiring: a former student, Jean-Pierre
Juy, recalls that &#8216;he related the taking of the Winter Palace as
though he&#8217;d been there&#8217;. But his most important contribution was
the string of books he wrote, together with a huge number of
articles. He founded and edited the journal <strong>Les Cahiers L&#233;on
Trotsky</strong>, devoted to the history of the revolutionary movement.</p>

<p>Brou&#233; was that rare combination, a scholar-militant. His works
show a tireless ability to trawl through obscure documents in
numerous languages in order to establish historical facts. But all
his wide-ranging work centred on one central question &#8211; the fate of
the Communist movement, born in 1917, which offered unprecedented
hope to humanity, and its transformation into the monstrosity of Stalinism.</p>

<p>His first major book was <strong>The Revolution and the Civil War in
Spain </strong>(1961). Earlier works, like Orwell&#8217;s <strong>Homage to
Catalonia</strong>, had shown how the revolutionary potential of 1936 was
strangled and betrayed by Stalinism and the Popular Front. But Brou&#233;
and his co-writer Emile T&#233;mime provided a comprehensive and fully
documented account of the events. His history of the Bolshevik Party
(1963) showed in remorseless detail how Lenin&#8217;s party was
transformed into the brutal and murderous instrument of Stalin&#8217;s
rule. <strong>The German Revolution 1917&#8211;1923</strong> (1971) [reviewed
below] was probably his masterpiece.</p>

<p>Brou&#233;&#8217;s biography of <strong>Trotsky</strong> (1988) was consciously
written in order to correct and go beyond the three volumes by Isaac
Deutscher. Deutscher gave a magnificent portrait of the individual
Trotsky, but gave relatively little importance to his efforts to
build a new organisation to oppose Stalinism. Brou&#233; stressed the
importance of Trotsky&#8217;s long struggle to found a new international.</p>

<p>His final major work was a synthesis of his earlier writings, a
history of the Communist International (1997). Here Brou&#233; broke new
ground. Previous histories of the Comintern had come from Cold
Warriors who saw it as a conspiracy against human freedom, or from
Stalinists who simply suppressed all the real problems. Even
Trotskyist historians, faced with terrible isolation, tended to a
defensiveness in which they applauded everything from the early
pre-Stalin years &#8211; &#8216;the First Four Congresses&#8217;. Brou&#233; showed
that although the Comintern had its roots in massive social
struggles, it also had substantial defects from the very first day,
notably narrow-minded bureaucrats who thought the revolution could be
spread simply by mechanically copying Russian experience. As he put
it, history sometimes progresses &#8216;by stammering&#8217;.</p>

<p>Brou&#233; opened the way for a new, non-defensive history of the
early years of international Communism (though neither man might have
welcomed the comparison, his approach had much in common with that
adopted by Tony Cliff in his <strong>Lenin</strong>).</p>

<p>Brou&#233; did not limit his attention to the Trotskyist current. He
helped to rescue from oblivion many other individuals from the
history of the left opposition. He was the first to publish the
writings of Victor Serge from Germany in 1923 and he collected the
correspondence between Trotsky and Alfred and Marguerite Rosmer.</p>

<p>Brou&#233;&#8217;s work provides a vital foundation for the study of the
successes and failures of the 20th century revolutionary movement,
for the honest and objective understanding of the past that we need
if we are to be more successful next time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, relatively little of Brou&#233;&#8217;s work is available
in English. <strong>The Revolution and the Civil War in Spain</strong>
(translated 1972) may still be available in libraries; <strong>The German
Revolution 1917&#8211;1923</strong> had to wait 33 years for an English
version. It is hoped that it may be possible to produce a special
issue of <strong>Revolutionary History</strong> containing material by Brou&#233;
not previously translated. At all events, Brou&#233; has left us a
valuable legacy on which a new generation of socialist historians
will have to build.</p>
