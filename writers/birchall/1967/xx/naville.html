<p class="fst"><strong>La Guerre et la R&#233;volution &#8211; 1: Guerres d&#8217;Asie: Vietnam et Cor&#233;e</strong><br />
Pierre Naville<br />
<em>&#201;tudes et Documentation Internationales, F18.50.</em></p>

<p class="fst">This volume contains, in unaltered form, the journalistic articles written by Pierre Naville on the questions of Vietnam and Korea between 1949 and 1956.</p>

<p>One admires M. Naville&#8217;s courage in submitting such transient writings to his readers&#8217; knowing hindsight; but it is hard to see the value of presenting the work in this form, especially when it contains such misguided judgments as the assertion that the Geneva Agreements were a victory for Ho Chi Minh. Would even Ho claim this now?</p>

<p>Certainly the work contains useful facts and insights. M. Naville stresses the importance of demoralisation among US troops in Korea; and shows how the US were weakened by the fact that soldiers served no more than one year &#8211; very relevant to Vietnam today. Equally interesting is the fact that, within a month of the outbreak of the Korean War, the Indian CP replaced an anti-Mao leadership by a pro-Mao one.</p>

<p>Moreover, M. Naville shows a knowledge of military strategy which could be equalled by few Marxists &#8211; perhaps to the extent of overestimating purely military factors. This is at the cost of social analysis; M. Naville&#8217;s clear partisanship for North Korea and the Vietnamese Revolution does not make up for the absence of this.</p>

<p>In both Korea and Vietnam there was a genuine national liberation movement based on guerillas; in both cases an underdeveloped country was cynically manipulated by two opposing world power blocs. The independent revolutionary movement was a bigger factor in Vietnam than in Korea; but was the quantitative difference great enough to become a qualitative one? Of this problem we still await an adequate Marxist analysis.</p>
