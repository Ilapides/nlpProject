<p class="fst"><strong>Ian Birchall</strong> writes: The Belgian situation of the last few months, with prolonged Parliamentary crisis and spasmodic outbreaks of nationalist violence, has been a complex and confused ones but the economic factor is a unifying thread.</p>

<p>It is ironic that, while the Common Market presents the main challenge to European workers, the Fleming-Walloon split still persists with such violence in Belgium. But the interpretation in purely racial terms is a superficial one. It is true; that the linguistic question is taken highly seriously by many, including students; true that neo-fascist groupings like the Flemish <em>Volksunie</em> have a marked influence; true that many Flemings still regard Nazi collaborators with affection.</p>

<p>But the real conflict is to be explained historically and economically. The Southern, Walloon area was industrialised nearly half a century before Flanders. It has a deeper socialist tradition, and provides the backbone of support for the social-democratic <em>F&#233;d&#233;ration G&#233;n&#233;rale des Travailleurs Belges</em>. It has also given birth to movements like the left-wing but ambiguously nationalist <em>Mouvement Wallon Populaire</em>. Flanders, without the same socialist traditions, is under Catholic influence, and furnishes die strength of the <em>Centre Syndical Chr&#233;tien</em>. The situation is complicated by the rapidly increasing Flemish population, which will be twice that of Wallonia by 1980; and by the presence in Belgium of over half a million foreign workers (six per cent of the total population, ten per cent of the population of Brussels, and 14 per cent of that of Li&#232;ge.)</p>

<p>The, violence at Limbourg in January, when two miners were murdered by the police, arose From the overproduction of coal in Western Europe (which affects Germany, NOW facfcdu with a stockpile of 16 million tons), as well as Belgium. In the days before the Limbourg incident, pit closures cost the jobs of 60,000 Walloon workers, and of only 4,000 Flemings.</p>

<p>At the same time, Belgium faces economic problems. The high level of public expenditure and the budget deficit threaten inflation; the national debt is expected to rise by 15 per cent in 1967.</p>

<p>While taxes for workers increased, the doctors took advantage of the situation to demand 25 per cent increases in medical charges. This was the immediate cause of the fall;of the Socialist-Social Christian Cabinet. Mr Van den Boeynants&#8217; Liberal-Social Christian coalition confirms the basic law for Social Democratic parties; no reforms can be won by entering coalition governments, and you finish up out anyhow.</p>

<p>Many years ago, Rosa Luxemburg urged the workers of Europe to team to &#8216;speak Belgian&#8217;; it is now even more urgent that the workers of Belgium learn to speak European.</p>
