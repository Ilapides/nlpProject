<p class="fst"><strong>Politics in England<br />
</strong>Richard Rose<br />
<em>Faber, 30s</em></p>

<p class="fst">In this book Rose claims to give a &#8216;sociological&#8217; analysis of political structures ana attitudes in modern Britain. What we get is a string of assertions, platitudinous or impressionistic about the British (ourselves?), curranted with some quite useful statistical material, mainly taken from such works as Almond and Verba&#8217;s <strong>The Civic Culture</strong>.</p>

<p>Rose&#8217;s definition of politics is a narrow one; he accepts on its face value the survey finding that 85 per cent of the population are not &#8216;very interested&#8217; in politics. He is interested in form rather than content; thus the same paragraph on pressure groups can compare the National Union of Mineworkers and the Automobile Association. CND rates a few bewildered mentions; the relation of the Bomb to the political power structure is not within Rose&#8217;s compass. He is struck by the fact that half the electorate read pro-Labour papers &#8211; but not by the fact that virtually the whole press is anti-trade-union. The relation of economics to politics is summed up in the inane sentence: &#8216;Money does not have the same weight in politics as in business, because though it may purchase goods in business, it cannot be used in politics to purchase votes&#8217; (p.110).</p>

<p>As a result, Rose is impressed above all by the degree of consensus in British society. &#8216;Wildcat strikes&#8217; get one brief mention. (Rose doesn&#8217;t want a demarcation dispute with the industrial sociologists.) Society is stable because of the &#8216;general socialisation process.&#8217; Thus &#8216;for the Etonian, the goal may be going into politics; for a boy at a local secondary modern school, becoming an apprentice engineer in a motorcar factory. Such individuals do not compete with one another for advancement in society; they do not meet&#8217; (p.123). Except in the non-political struggle for wages.</p>

<p>Some day soon Rose&#8217;s cardboard model of England is going to explode in his face.</p>
