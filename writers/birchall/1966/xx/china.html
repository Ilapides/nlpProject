<p class="fst"><B>La Question Chinoise dans l&rsquo;Internationale Communiste
(1926-1927)</B><BR>(presented by) Pierre Brou&eacute;<BR><I>&Eacute;tudes
et Documentation Internationales, 16.10F</I></P>
<p class="fst">Readers of French will find great interest in this collection of
documents on the Chinese question in the Communist International in
the period 1926-1927. It contains texts by Stalin, Trotsky, Zinoviev,
the Chinese left oppositionist Chen Du-xiu, and others, as well as
the letter from Shanghai by the mission of the Communist
International to China. Stalinist opportunism during this period
meant neglect of building an independent workers&rsquo; movement in
favour of work within the Kuomintang. The Chinese Communist Party
opposed strikes by non-industrial workers so as to preserve a front
with the petty-bourgeoisie, and the German Communist Press even
presented Chiang Kai-schek as the leader of the Chinese workers. The
outcome was the massacre and destruction of the Chinese proletarian
movement.</P>
<P>The texts by Stalin are an object-lesson in how to transform
dialectics into bourgeois relativism; any opportunism or betrayal is
justified by &lsquo;specific national conditions.&rsquo; Trotsky, on
the other hand, makes a lucid adaptation of the permanent revolution
theory to Chinese conditions. The Chinese question posed
internationalism in a concrete form, for the betrayal of the Chinese
workers was closely linked to the smashing of the left opposition in
Russia. Two questions remain with the reader. Firstly, have those
Maoists who today revere the memory of Stalin any knowledge of this
period? Second, how many revolutionaries in underdeveloped countries
will be betrayed because they trust Mao in the way the Chinese Party
trusted Stalin?</p>
