<h2>Ian Birchall</h2>

<h1>The careless party</h1>

<h3>(October 1987)</h3>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Worker Review</strong>, No.&#160;102, October 1987.<br />
Transcribed by Christian H&#248;gsbjerg.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217; Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<hr width="100%" noshade="noshade" size="1" />
<p class="fst">DURING the election campaign Kinnock was asked his views on religion; he replied that he wasn&#8217;t sure whether he was an agnostic. I have a certain sympathy with this sort of double-strength agnosticism, as I have similar feelings about the current debate as to whether <strong>Labour Weekly</strong> should be closed down.</p>

<p>I know the arguments. It is the left in the Labour Party which wants to keep <strong>Labour Weekly</strong>; Kinnock is trying to close it because he wants to stifle any possible criticism from the left. It&#8217;s a fairly straightforward question of principle, and if I had a vote on the matter I could be relied on to use it the right way.</p>

<p>But against this I have to balance the powerful argument that if <strong>Labour Weekly</strong> were shut down I should not have to read it any longer. I have always believed that, alongside the pleasures of belonging to a revolutionary organisation (like selling papers in the snow and reading <strong>Internal Bulletins</strong>) a true Bolshevik should do one really unpleasant job for the party. For some years now my contribution has been reading <strong>Tribune</strong> and <strong>Labour Weekly</strong> every Saturday. Somebody has to do it.</p>

<p><strong>Labour Weekly</strong> has, throughout its 16 years, set a consistent standard of journalistic drabness. <strong>New Socialist</strong> (also for the chop) does from time to time carry intriguing, if obscure, debates on such topics as whether you should let the <em>au pair</em> breast-feed the baby. <strong>Labour Weekly</strong> keeps its feet firmly on the ground with reports of regional Labour Party Conferences, a view of the world in which all evil is the fault of the Tories, and lots of details about internal organisation.</p>

<p>The front page of the 11 September issue carries not only a large picture of Norman Willis, but also the stirring banner headline: <em>Unions Have Doubts On The College: Opinion Moving Towards OMOV</em>.</p>

<p>Not, you might feel, a good front page to sell in your local shopping centre. But then nobody much sells <strong>Labour Weekly</strong>. The circulation is around 19,000, while the Labour Party has some 300,000 members.</p>

<p>Some years ago at a CND conference I saw a <strong>Labour Weekly</strong> seller. One of my comrades, whose style I must admit is sometimes a little abrasive, accosted him, commenting that he was the only <strong>Labour Weekly</strong> seller he had ever seen. A few weeks later I was on a demonstration in Liverpool and saw someone selling <strong>Labour Weekly</strong>. So my sectarian comrade had been wrong, I thought. I looked again and realised it was the same man.</p>

<p>But soon even that valiant salesperson will become redundant. If Kinnock has his way, the drab <strong>Labour Weekly</strong> will be replaced by the vacuous <strong>Labour Party News</strong>. <strong>Labour Party News</strong> isn&#8217;t sold, so you can&#8217;t buy it. It is mailed direct to 110,000 Labour Party members.</p>

<p>Or so they think. In fact the tight security of Walworth Road has been breached, and one copy of <strong>Labour Party News</strong> is being sent to an SWP member, heavily disguised under an implausible pseudonym.</p>

<p>So we can reveal something of the mind-numbing contents of <strong>Labour Party News</strong>. There is useful information, ranging from how to plug a 30-watt amplifier into your car cigarette lighter to how to get a bone china &#8220;Roses for Socialism&#8221; plate for just &#163;25. There are pictures &#8211; many in full colour. Issue number three has seven pictures of Kinnock, number four has five. Almost like <strong>Pravda</strong> in the golden days.</p>

<p>And then there are advertisements. The back page carries full page adverts for the <strong>Daily Mirror</strong>. These used to appear in <strong>New Socialist</strong> until that journal carried a mildly impolite interview with Robert Maxwell, whereupon they promptly disappeared. There is little danger that <strong>Labour Party News</strong> will insult Robert Maxwell &#8211; or anyone else with advertising revenue to dispose of.</p>

<p>With all these delights it is surprising to read that &#8220;there are still almost 200,000 members who are entitled to a copy, but aren&#8217;t getting one. We can&#8217;t help unless we know who they are and where they are.&#8221; This despite the fact that <strong>Labour Party News</strong> is free and can be obtained by returning a reply-paid card.</p>

<p>As Oscar Wilde&#8217;s Lady Bracknell said: &#8220;To lose a parent may be considered as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.&#8221; It must be a very careless party that loses two-thirds of its membership.</p>

<p>Except for the fact that this is just the sort of party Kinnock wants. For reformist parties are based on passivity, and a membership that is so passive that it can&#8217;t be bothered ordering a free magazine won&#8217;t give the leadership much trouble.</p>

<p>The bitterest insult in the Labour vocabulary is now &#8220;activist&#8221;. Of course, one or two people are allowed to be active. Neil Kinnock and Roy Hattersley can attend 15 meetings a week, alternatively bullying and arselicking to advance their careers. That&#8217;s called &#8220;dedication&#8221;. But if the rest of us prefer to attend meetings instead of watching the television, we become &#8220;unrepresentative activists&#8221;.</p>

<p>The Labour Party has the press it deserves. And remember, only 24 years ago the Labour Party had its own <em>daily</em> paper. That paper was sold to become the <strong>Sun</strong>. And now Labour can&#8217;t &#8211; or daren&#8217;t &#8211; even produce a weekly. Remember that next time someone tells you the Labour Party is the mass organisation of the working class.</p>
