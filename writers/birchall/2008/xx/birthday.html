<p class="fst">September 1958 saw the first issue of a journal called
<strong>International Socialism</strong>. It was in duplicated form and
undoubtedly had a very limited circulation, being produced and
distributed by the tiny Socialist Review Group which counted its
members in tens rather than hundreds. Even in the small world of
1950s British Marxism it was marginal in comparison to the Communist
Party&#8217;s monumentally tedious <strong>Marxism Today</strong>, <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>
to the <strong>New Reasoner</strong> and <strong>Universities and Left Review</strong>,
which in 1960 would merge to form <strong>New Left Review</strong>, and, on the
Trotskyist fringe, to the Socialist Labour League&#8217;s <strong>Labour
Review</strong>, which in the late 1950s was a lively journal with such
contributors as Peter Fryer, Brian Pearce and Alasdair MacIntyre. <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a></p>

<p>But for the far left it was a time of new opportunities. The
ferment of debate provoked by the Hungarian Revolution of 1956
continued. At Easter 1958 the first Aldermaston march for unilateral
nuclear disarmament had taken place. In the summer and autumn there
was a minor wave of industrial struggle involving bus crews, dockers
and building workers. There were also threats: over the Channel in
France the Fourth Republic had collapsed and been replaced by a more
authoritarian regime under General de Gaulle. The presentation of the
new journal was, in a modest and highly realistic manner, optimistic:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The decline in Western capitalism &#8211; however protracted
&#8211; is steadily undermining the stranglehold of reformism, its
servant, over the working class. Stalinism &#8211; the ideological
expression of the state capitalist world &#8211; is losing its potency as
an alternative. Once again the international working class is looking
to its own resources for strength and inspiration.</p>

<p class="fst">The two main articles were by the main theoreticians of the group
Tony Cliff and Mike Kidron. Cliff&#8217;s article, <em>Changes in
Stalinist Russia</em>, examined changes in industrial management in
the Khrushchev period and the attempts to deal with lagging labour
productivity. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> Despite developments
since Joseph Stalin&#8217;s death Russia remained a repressive,
irrational society. Kidron&#8217;s <em>The Economic Background of the
Recent Strikes</em> took up two themes that would be developed in his
later contributions to the journal: the decline in Britain&#8217;s
imperial role and the significance of the arms budget. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a></p>

<p>In a sense the launch of the journal was a false start. In 1959
what purported to be a double issue of the journal was in fact a
small book by Cliff on <strong>Rosa Luxemburg</strong>. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a>
Then, in the autumn of 1960, the journal was relaunched as a
quarterly. This time its editorial board was not limited to the
Socialist Review Group but included supporters of the Fourth
International (including two who were to become followers of Juan
Posadas <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a>) and others who would become
members of the Solidarity grouping. <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a>
As so often this effort at left unity collapsed, and from 1963 the
journal was simply the organ of the International Socialism group (as
the Socialist Review Group was now known). <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a>
It appeared quarterly and then monthly until 1977 when it was
replaced by a new quarterly series in book format which has continued
to the present.</p>

<p>Fifty years for a theoretical journal is a substantial
achievement. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> There are close on 1,000
articles plus editorials, reviews and letters. Obviously the quality
is uneven. There are mediocre, boring and obscure articles, and
polemics that seemed terribly important at the time but are now of
little interest. There are also some historical curiosities of
particular interest to students of renegacy. These include youthful
efforts by Christopher Hitchens, <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a>
actually more intelligent and better written than his current output,
and some industrial commentaries by Roger Rosewell, <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a>
later unofficial spokesperson for Dame Shirley Porter and more
recently author of a tome on medieval wall paintings. There are also
some dubious predictions such as Duncan Hallas&#8217;s claim in 1977 that
&#8220;it may well be the case that Callaghan&#8217;s is the <em>last</em>
majority Labour government&#8221;. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a></p>

<p>However, overall a collection of the two series provides a rich
store of political analysis and commentary. In comparison with its
main rival, <strong>New Left Review</strong>, which for long periods produced
relatively little that was directly relevant to contemporary
struggle, <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a> <strong>International
Socialism</strong> was always geared to practice, to an interpretation of
the current world in the perspective of changing it.</p>

<p>But if the journal has always been a party journal, geared to the
priorities of the organisation, it has been alive to the various
debates on the British and international left. It has published
contributions from all parts of the spectrum of the left on both
directly political and broader cultural questions. Thus the journal
has carried pieces by Tariq Ali and others on the Fourth
International (<strong>IS2/6</strong>), Robin Blackburn on Cuba (<strong>IS2/9</strong>),
John Saville on the Marshall Plan and the Cold War (<strong>IS2/46</strong>),
Dan Atkinson and Larry Elliot on Keynes and the economic crisis, <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a>
John Berger on mass demonstrations <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a>
and Picasso (<strong>IS2/40</strong>), Terry Eagleton on Shakespeare (<strong>IS2/49</strong>)
and Steven Rose on animal rights (<strong>IS2/54</strong>).</p>

<p>From the international left there have been contributions from
Jean-Jacques Marie on Gaullism (<strong>IS1/3</strong>), Ellen Wood on
alternatives to reformism (<strong>IS2/35</strong>), Ernest Mandel on the
analysis of Russian society (<strong>IS2/49</strong>, <strong>IS2/56</strong>), and Susan
George, <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a> Walden Bello <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a>
and Boris Kagarlitsky <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a> on
perspectives for the anti-capitalist movement.</p>

<p>Until recently comrades who wished to consult material from back
issues had to hunt it down in libraries or beg, steal or borrow it
from older comrades who had kept files. Now, thanks to the wonders of
modern technology, <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> a great many
articles from the past 50 years are available at the click of a
mouse. In particular comrades can consult three valuable websites.</p>

<p>The <em>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism OnLine</em> has a complete index
of the first series of <strong>International Socialism</strong> with the full
text of many articles and reviews. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a>
It is worth checking this site regularly as new material is being
added all the time. The Socialist Review and International Socialism
Journal Index has an index arranged by subject covering the first 108
issues of the second series with the full text of articles from issue
61 onwards. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a> And the International
Socialism website has the full text of all issues from 100 onwards
together with a small archive of items from earlier issues. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a>
Again it is worth checking for updates. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p>What follows is intended simply as a guide to a small selection of
articles that comrades may find of interest. It will be no more than
a brief survey of <strong>International Socialism</strong> over the past 50
years. This is not a greatest hits compilation. The decision of what
to include has been largely subjective. My sincere apologies to
comrades whose late night labours and cherished brainchildren do not
get a name-check. I hope it will encourage readers to explore the
resources available and make their own discoveries. If I have devoted
more space to the earlier period, it is because it is probably less
familiar to most readers.</p>

<p>In many ways the years before 1968 were the golden age of the
journal. Doubtless that claim contains an element of nostalgia on my
part (as anyone from my age group will tell you, music and sex were
better in those days too). But it was also a question of the
journal&#8217;s role in relation to the organisation. Membership was very
small &#8211; well under 100 in 1960, just over 400 by the start of 1968.
Comrades were active in campaigns &#8211; nuclear disarmament and
anti-apartheid, then in the mid-1960s tenants&#8217; movements and some
industrial struggles &#8211; but the organisation was far too small to
intervene in its own name. In the early 1960s most activity took
place in the sectarian hothouse of the Labour Party Young Socialists.</p>

<p>As a result the struggle for ideas was vital, and the fact that in
1962 the Socialist Review Group was renamed the International
Socialism group was a clear indication of just how central the role
of the journal was. The Marxism of the journal in those years was
confident and flexible. Confident because unlike those who saw Russia
as socialist or even a &#8220;degenerated workers&#8217; state&#8221; we had
nothing to make contorted apologies for. Confident too because first
Harold Macmillan&#8217;s Tories and then Harold Wilson&#8217;s Labour
government showed themselves utterly inept at solving the problems of
British society. Meanwhile a rising level of industrial struggle
showed that the class struggle was far from dead, as it had been
pronounced by Labour politicians. Marxism was clearly relevant to the
world we lived in.</p>

<p>But because the Marxism of <strong>International Socialism</strong> was
confident it was also adaptable. Tony Cliff was quite happy to
describe his work as &#8220;revisionist&#8221;. <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a>
Some of the central tenets of orthodox Trotskyism were called into
question. Mike Kidron showed that Lenin&#8217;s <strong>Imperialism:
the Highest Stage of Capitalism</strong> was
&#8220;supremely good theory in its day&#8221; but in a radically changed
world &#8220;no more the complete manual&#8221;. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a>
Cliff showed that the theory of permanent revolution needed updating
in the light of the Chinese and Cuban revolutions. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a></p>

<p>The work of Cliff and Kidron provided the theoretical core of the
journal. Cliff had spent most of the 1950s developing the theory of
state capitalism with books on Russia, China and the Eastern European
satellites. Now he was pursuing the implications of this into a more
general attempt to develop and revise Marxism for the modern epoch.
In <em>Trotsky on Substitutionism</em> he discussed what form of
organisation was appropriate for revolutionary socialists in the
modern period. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a> In so doing he was
polemicising against both the ultra-Bolshevism of the Socialist
Labour League and the anti-Leninists of the Solidarity current. In
<em>The Labour Party in Perspective</em> he made some important
observations on the nature of class consciousness, though his
conclusion was that Marxists would continue working within the Labour
Party for the foreseeable future. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a>
There was also a savage polemic entitled <em>The End of the Road</em>
against Isaac Deutscher, <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a> who had
just published the final volume of his biographical trilogy on
Trotsky. Cliff claimed that &#8220;under Deutscher&#8217;s pen, Stalinism is
the legitimate child of the revolution&#8221;. The article should be read
alongside Peter Sedgwick&#8217;s <em>Tragedy of the Tragedian</em> <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a>
which recalls Deutscher&#8217;s very real merits, neglected by Cliff in
his polemical zeal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mike Kidron was developing his work on the &#8220;permanent
arms economy&#8221; &#8211; an explanation of the very real but impermanent
boom in post-war capitalism. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a>
Kidron&#8217;s work was an important corrective to the Third Worldism
widespread on the left. Amid the relative tranquillity of British
society many were tempted to believe that the real action was in
Algeria, Vietnam and Cuba. In <em>International Capitalism</em> Kidron
sternly reminded them that the main struggle was at home:</p>

<p class="quoteb">To believe nowadays that the short route to revolution in
London, New York or Paris lies through Calcutta, Havana or Algiers,
is to pass the buck to where it has no currency. To act on this
belief is to rob the revolutionary socialist movement of the few
dollars it still possesses. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a></p>

<p class="fst">Cliff and Kidron had gathered around themselves a talented team of
writers. For a few years Alasdair MacIntyre, later a world renowned
philosopher, was a regular contributor to the journal. <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a>
One of his more controversial offerings was <em>Prediction and
Politics</em> <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a> which argued that the
overthrow of capitalism depended on a &#8220;long-term mass change in
consciousness; and there are no conditions which can make such a
change either inevitable or impossible&#8221;. Cliff and Kidron, feeling
that this made too many concessions to voluntarism, insisted on
reprinting Hal Draper&#8217;s <em>The &#8216;Inevitability of Socialism&#8217;</em>
which argued for &#8220;strict determinism&#8221; and &#8220;the historic
inevitability of man&#8217;s ascent to humanity&#8221;. <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a>
Belief in the inevitability of socialism is not much of a problem
today as the spectre of barbarism looms ever larger, but the debate
is well worth reading to see two powerful minds exploring the logic
of Marxism.</p>

<p>Peter Sedgwick was a remarkable and original writer who had the
rare gift of being very funny and profoundly serious at the same
time. He will be remembered among other things for his translations
of Victor Serge. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a> His essay on
<em>Victor Serge and Socialism</em> introduced a writer who was
virtually unknown to the British left. <a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a>
Serge was a dissident even among dissidents and Sedgwick&#8217;s
fascination with Serge reflected his own unease at accepting any
orthodoxy. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a> Sedgwick also
contributed an article on <em>The Two New Lefts</em>, a perceptive
critique of the strengths and weaknesses of the post-1956 British
left. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a> A complement to this was
Sedgwick&#8217;s <em>Pseud Left Review</em>, a caustic scatological parody
of the convoluted style which characterised Perry Anderson&#8217;s <strong>New
Left Review</strong>: &#8220;Nowhere has the archaic insularity and
parochialism of the British intelligentsia been more suffocating than
in its failure to render a totalising synthesis of the means of
excretion in our society&#8221;. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a> It
was an important reminder to <strong>International Socialism</strong>
contributors to keep their writing concrete and accessible.</p>

<p>Labour historian Ray Challinor&#8217;s <em>Zigzag: The Communist Party
and the Bomb</em> (<strong>IS1/3</strong>) provided useful ammunition for
comrades in the nuclear disarmament movement faced with a Communist
Party which was enjoying a brief revival. Jim Higgins&#8217;s <em>Ten
Years for the Locust</em> gave a pioneering account of British
Trotskyism during and after the Second World War (&#8220;a history of
failure but ... also a history of struggle and high endeavour&#8221;)
providing valuable background to current disputes in the Young
Socialists. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a></p>

<p>By the mid-1960s some of the new generation recruited as students
around 1960 were contributing to the journal. Nigel Harris, who took
over as editor in 1965, wrote among other things on the rise of
Maoism, now a significant current on the left following the
Sino-Soviet split of the early 1960s. In <em>Marxism:
Leninism-Stalinism-Maoism</em> he concluded that &#8220;Stalin and Mao ...
have revised Marxism sufficiently to render it a contradiction of its
original purposes&#8221;. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a> <em>China:
What Price Culture?</em> dismissed the Cultural Revolution (which was
provoking great enthusiasm on some parts of the left) as &#8220;irrelevant
to the poverty of the mass of the population&#8221; and a &#8220;battle ...
between different factions of an embryonic ruling class&#8221;. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a></p>

<p>Chris Harman&#8217;s <em>Tribune of the People</em> (a history of the
Labour left&#8217;s weekly newspaper) provided a valuable critique of the
mainstream Labour left which after the years of Bevanism was now
largely capitulating to Harold Wilson. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a>
He concluded sourly, &#8220;When the working class itself begins to solve
its own problems, <strong>Tribune</strong> will no doubt ... be looking the
other way.&#8221; For the 50th anniversary of the Russian Revolution in
1967 Harman wrote the much republished <em>How the Revolution was
Lost</em>, <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a> which provided a
historical complement to Cliff&#8217;s work on state capitalism and
answered frequently raised questions as to when and how Russia became
state capitalist.</p>

<p>It is often claimed that <strong>New Left Review</strong> introduced the
British left to a range of hitherto unknown foreign Marxists. This
contribution was a real one, though some of its discoveries might
have been better left undisturbed. But <strong>International Socialism</strong>
also played a part. A proposal to translate Georg Lukács&#8217;s <strong>History
and Class Consciousness</strong> had to be abandoned for copyright
reasons. <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a> Erich Gerlach&#8217;s essay
on <em>Karl Korsch&#8217;s Undogmatic Marxism</em> introduced an unknown
thinker to a new generation <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a> and
Chris Harman&#8217;s enthusiastic review article on Antonio Gramsci
appeared at a time when the Italian communist was still little known
in Britain. <a href="#n48" name="f48">[48]</a></p>

<p>For those who have heard <strong>International Socialism</strong> derided as
&#8220;workerist&#8221; and &#8220;economistic&#8221; it may come as a surprise to
learn that in the Kidron-Harris years the journal often published
poetry. There were poems by Hugh MacDiarmid (<strong>IS1/1</strong>), Adrian
Mitchell <a href="#n49" name="f49">[49]</a> and Roger McGough
(<strong>IS1/29</strong>) before they achieved their present eminence. More
directly rooted in struggle were a selection of <em>Songs with Teeth</em>,
<a href="#n50" name="f50">[50]</a> several of them from the Scottish
anti-nuclear movement and including Eric Morse&#8217;s legendary <em>Worker&#8217;s
Bomb</em>. An obituary of the surrealist poet Andr&#233; Breton <a href="#n51" name="f51">[51]</a>
apparently persuaded the young David Widgery to join the
organisation. <a href="#n52" name="f52">[52]</a> And one good reason
to seek out the originals, despite availability on-line, is the
magnificent series of covers designed by Reuben Fior. <a href="#n53" name="f53">[53]</a></p>

<p>With the advent of the Labour government there was a rising level
of industrial struggle and the group was able to make some small
interventions especially around the 1966 book <strong>Incomes Policy,
Legislation and Shop Stewards</strong> by Cliff and Colin Barker. The
journal reflected this development with Barker&#8217;s article <em>The
British Labour Movement &#8211; Aspects of Current Experience</em> <a href="#n54" name="f54">[54]</a>
and an analysis by Joyce Rosser and Barker of <em>A Working Class
Defeat: The ENV Story</em> <a href="#n55" name="f55">[55]</a> telling
the story of the organisation&#8217;s first factory branch in north west
London and drawing the lessons of the way trade union organisation
there was eventually smashed.</p>

<p>The period after 1968 saw major changes in the organisation. <a href="#n56" name="f56">[56]</a>
The membership grew amid a rising wave of industrial struggle that
lasted until 1975. The role of the journal necessarily changed but
its main aim was to provide a strategic framework for the
organisation&#8217;s activity. Chris Harman took over as editor; there
would be no more poetry but a number of articles related to the tasks
of the new period. Cliff&#8217;s <em>On Perspectives</em> set out the
economic analysis and political priorities for the coming years <a href="#n57" name="f57">[57]</a>
while Harman&#8217;s <em>Party and Class</em> provided a retrospective
assessment of issues emerging from the fierce internal debate on
internal organisation. <a href="#n58" name="f58">[58]</a></p>

<p>At the beginning of the 1970s the journal published two major
analyses of international perspectives for the coming decade, which
were discussed at the International Socialism conference in spring
1970, and later that year at an international conference the group
sponsored along with the French organisation <em>Lutte Ouvri&#232;re</em>
and the American International Socialists. Chris Harman wrote on <em>The
Stalinist States</em>, observing that Russia and its satellites were
facing &#8220;a chronic crisis of slowing growth rates&#8221; and predicting
that &#8220;the chronic crises of state capitalism will inevitably reach
a nodal point at which the whole system is threatened&#8221;. <a href="#n59" name="f59">[59]</a>
Nigel Harris examined <em>The Third World</em> and concluded:</p>

<p class="quoteb">What is centrally lacking in the backward countries today
is a clearly expressed strategy to establish the dictatorship of the
proletariat. Without this aim the sporadic involvement of workers in
broader movements has no specific political implications except as a
possible prelude to proletarian independence. <a href="#n60" name="f60">[60]</a></p>

<p class="fst">In 1973 the journal moved to monthly publication under the
editorship of Duncan Hallas. Initially this was not a success.
Articles were limited to a maximum of two pages and the journal
became an uneasy halfway house between a theoretical journal and a
current affairs magazine. The only memorable contribution was a piece
by Hallas, <em>Fourth International in decline</em>, which broke the
length rules and provided an account of the post-war degeneration of
the Fourth International. <a href="#n61" name="f61">[61]</a> As the
euphoria of 1968 faded some comrades were tempted by the formulations
of &#8220;orthodox&#8221; Trotskyism. Hallas&#8217;s article was a stern warning
against any such reversion.</p>

<p>After an abortive attempt to bring Kidron back as editor Chris
Harman resumed the editorship in the autumn of 1973. It was a stormy
period for the left. The Chilean coup was followed by the 1974
British general election, where working class action brought down a
Tory government. Central to the organisation&#8217;s aims was the
building of a rank and file movement in the unions. The general
perspective on which such a strategy was based was set out in Andreas
Nagliati&#8217;s article <em>Towards a Rank and File Movement</em>. <a href="#n62" name="f62">[62]</a>
This began from the assumption that &#8220;we are at the beginning of a
period of growing sharp conflict&#8221; and argued that revolutionaries
must take &#8220;the greatest care ... to involve broad support&#8221; but
also &#8220;to put their more general political ideas across&#8221;. In the
following years a number of articles addressed the question of rank
and file organisation and the history of such movements. Pete
Glatter, a working busman, contributed a piece on the London busmen&#8217;s
rank and file movement of the 1930s <a href="#n63" name="f63">[63]</a>
drawing on rank and file papers from the period and recalling a bus
workers&#8217; song to the tune of Clementine that asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s the
use of having a pension unless you are still alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>Another important piece from this period was Duncan Hallas&#8217;s
<em>White Collar Workers</em>. <a href="#n64" name="f64">[64]</a> There
had been a tendency in the International Socialists to identify the
working class with manual workers but in the 1970s there was a rise
in militancy from groups of workers with few previous traditions of
struggle. By 1974 white collar workers constituted &#8220;around 42
percent of the workforce in Britain&#8221;. Hallas concluded with a
long-standing theme of the International Socialist tradition: the
insistence that the main struggle is always that on one&#8217;s own
doorstep. &#8220;It is no use looking with vicarious pleasure at members
working in a big car plant or a steelworks if you work in a civil
service office. The job is to build in that office.&#8221;</p>

<p>These years also saw a sharp internal struggle in the organisation
about strategy and perspectives and a number of articles in the
journal were thinly veiled polemics. Cliff&#8217;s <em>Lenin&#8217;s <strong>Pravda</strong></em>
(based on material for his later biography of Lenin) was part of his
campaign to change the orientation and style of <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>.
<a href="#n65" name="f65">[65]</a> Jim Higgins&#8217;s <em>Now Let Us
Praise Leon Trotsky</em> was a parting shot from a veteran comrade
soon to be excluded from the organisation and can be read as a veiled
polemic against Cliff&#8217;s version of Leninism. <a href="#n66" name="f66">[66]</a></p>

<p>In 1975 a special issue written by Cliff was devoted to <em>Portugal
at the Crossroads</em>. <a href="#n67" name="f67">[67]</a> This was
rapidly translated into six languages. While the history of 1968 has
been travestied and distorted the Portuguese Revolution of 1974&#8211;5,
the biggest and most potentially revolutionary explosion of working
class self-activity that Europe has seen since 1945, has been simply
written out of history, and nowadays few people are aware of the
events. Cliff&#8217;s analysis is open to retrospective criticisms &#8211; he
focused too much on the choice between socialist revolution and
&#8220;extreme reaction&#8221; on the Chilean model and underestimated the
threat posed by social democracy. But as a record of a memorable
period of working class struggle it deserves to be read and remembered.</p>

<p>Harman was succeeded as editor by Duncan Hallas and then Alex
Callinicos. In 1977, to celebrate the journal&#8217;s hundredth issue,
Callinicos published contributions from all four former editors.
Kidron&#8217;s piece, <em>Two Insights Don&#8217;t Make a Theory</em>, <a href="#n68" name="f68">[68]</a>
made a sharp critique of his own earlier work. It was effectively a
farewell from the man who had once so brilliantly edited the journal.
<a href="#n69" name="f69">[69]</a> Chris Harman&#8217;s <em>Better a Valid
Insight Than a Wrong Theory</em> was a valiant defence of the young
Kidron against his later self. <a href="#n70" name="f70">[70]</a></p>

<p>The year 1977 also saw the Lewisham demonstration against the
National Front following which the Socialist Workers Party (as the
organisation had now become) was widely vilified. <a href="#n71" name="f71">[71]</a>
The journal made no concessions but sought to arm comrades for the
inevitable arguments with an article by Callinicos and Alistair
Hatchett, brazenly entitled <em>In Defence of Violence</em>, which
concluded that &#8220;the only real answer to the violence of ruling
class power is the organised power of the working class&#8221;. <a href="#n72" name="f72">[72]</a></p>

<p>At the beginning of 1978 the first series of <strong>International
Socialism</strong> came to an end and was replaced by the monthly
<strong>Socialist Review</strong> which in its early issues aimed to relate to
the new milieu around the Anti Nazi League. The initiative to launch
a new series of <strong>International Socialism</strong> came initially from a
group of comrades outside the Central Committee but the new
quarterly, edited for its first ten years by Peter Binns, rapidly
took its place in the Socialist Workers Party&#8217;s range of publications.</p>

<p>The new journal reflected many of the crucial arguments going on
within the party. One heated debate concerned the relation of Marxism
to feminism and in particular the role of the <strong>Women&#8217;s Voice</strong>
magazine in the party. Tony Cliff presented articles on Clara Zetkin
(<strong>IS2/13</strong>) and Alexandra Kollontai (<strong>IS2/14</strong>), first drafts
of chapters from his 1984 book <strong>Class Struggle and Women&#8217;s
Liberation</strong>, but containing additional material not in the book.
There were sharp criticisms of his treatment of Zetkin from Lin James
and Anna Paczuska, Juliet Ash and Janet Vaux (<strong>IS2/14)</strong>. Irene
Bruegel (<strong>IS2/1</strong>), Floya Anthias (<strong>IS2/2</strong>), Joan Smith
(<strong>IS2/3</strong>), Barbara Winslow (<strong>IS2/4</strong>) and Lin James (<strong>IS2/7</strong>)
presented a range of positions on the question of the family and
women&#8217;s oppression. Lindsey German&#8217;s <em>Theories of Patriarchy</em>
challenged ideas widespread in the women&#8217;s movement by setting out
to &#8220;show that it is not men who &#8216;benefit&#8217; from the oppression
of women but capital&#8221;. <a href="#n73" name="f73">[73]</a> The
continuing threat from the far right was covered in two articles by
Colin Sparks on fascism and the working class: <em>The German
Experience</em> (<strong>IS2/2</strong>) and <em>The National Front Today</em> (<strong>IS2/3</strong>).</p>

<p>There was also a broader debate about perspectives for the current
period as the Labour government collapsed and Margaret Thatcher came
to power. Chris Harman&#8217;s <em>Crisis of the European revolutionary
left</em> (<strong>IS2/4</strong>) was an informative survey of developments on
the far left in Europe and also raised questions relevant to the
difficulties which the SWP faced in this period. Steve Jeffreys&#8217;
article <em>Striking into the Eighties</em> (<strong>IS2/5</strong>), which
looked to a continuation of the current level of industrial struggle,
drew a swift rejoinder from Cliff who, in <em>The Balance of Class
Forces in Recent Years</em>, set out his argument that the movement
was now entering a period of &#8220;downturn&#8221;. <a href="#n74" name="f74">[74]</a>
This was Cliff at his best. His argument did not rely simply on
statistics but contained extensive quotations from industrial
militants speaking in their own voice about the changing situation in
the workplace. Alex Callinicos&#8217;s <em>The Rank and File Movement
Today</em> (<strong>IS2/17</strong>) marked the abandonment of the rank and file
strategy while insisting that such a perspective was &#8220;essentially
correct &#8211; in the appropriate conditions&#8221;.</p>

<p>The journal continued to respond quickly to events. When
Jaruzelski&#8217;s coup crushed the Solidarity movement in Poland in
December 1981 a book length special issue, <em>Solidarnosc: From
Gdansk to Military Repression</em>, was produced within weeks by Colin
Barker and Kara Weber (<strong>IS2/15</strong>).</p>

<p>The Great Miners&#8217; Strike of 1984&#8211;5 was central to the
Socialist Workers Party&#8217;s activity for a year. The story of the
strike was told in another special book length issue, <strong>The Great
Strike</strong> by Alex Callinicos and Mike Simons (<strong>IS2/27 &amp;
IS2/28</strong>), and Cliff analysed <em>Patterns of Mass Strike</em> from
1905 to 1985. <a href="#n75" name="f75">[75]</a> The strike also gave
rise to an interesting covert polemic. Early in 1986 Paul Foot
published a short pamphlet on the miners&#8217; leader of the 1920s A.J.
Cook. <a href="#n76" name="f76">[76]</a> Cliff responded with an
article entitled <em>The Tragedy of A.J. Cook</em>, which never named
Foot but was a direct attack on what Cliff saw as Foot&#8217;s excessive
sympathy for Cook (<strong>IS2/31</strong>). Cliff and Foot greatly liked and
respected each other but there were real tensions between the two
men. The polemic was doubly veiled for though the name was never
mentioned by Cliff it was clear that the real subject of debate was
not Cook but Scargill.</p>

<p>There were also lively exchanges on philosophical and cultural
questions. Alex Callinicos&#8217;s 1982 book <strong>Is There A Future for
Marxism?</strong> provoked a debate between Binns (<strong>IS2/17</strong>),
Callinicos (<strong>IS2/19</strong>) and Harman (<strong>IS2/21</strong>) showing that
the party leadership was far from monolithic on philosophical
questions. A critical review of Dave Widgery&#8217;s 1986 work <strong>Beating
Time</strong>, a history of Rock Against Racism (<strong>IS2/33</strong>) by myself
drew a vigorous response from Widgery (<strong>IS2/35</strong>) in which I was
categorised among &#8220;the sniffer dogs of Orthodox Trotskyism&#8221;.</p>

<p>In 1988 John Rees replaced Binns as editor. The journal continued
to produced a wide range of material on political and theoretical
questions. There were special issues on the French Revolution
(<strong>IS2/43</strong>) and the Frederick Engels centenary. <a href="#n77" name="f77">[77]</a>
Rees&#8217;s <em>In Defence of October</em> (<strong>IS2/52</strong>) provoked a wide
ranging debate about Leninism and Stalinism eliciting responses from,
among others, Samuel Farber, Robert Service and Robin Blackburn (<strong>IS2/55</strong>).</p>

<p>The collapse of &#8220;Communism&#8221; in the Eastern bloc was in some
ways a confirmation of analyses developed by Cliff and others many
years earlier but it also required further elucidation. In particular
Chris Harman&#8217;s article <em>The Storm Breaks</em> (<strong>IS2/46</strong>)
attempted to show at considerable length how the state capitalist
theory could explain the &#8220;contradictory development&#8221; in Eastern
Europe. Despite dramatic political changes, he argued, &#8220;the central
power of the ruling class was untouched&#8221;. What had happened was
that &#8220;the pygmy state capitalisms of Eastern Europe have cracked
apart in the face of competition from the new giants of the world order&#8221;.</p>

<p>The rise of New Labour during the 1990s produced a number of
commentaries. Chris Harman&#8217;s <em>From Bernstein to Blair: One
Hundred Years of Revisionism</em> showed that while Bernstein and
Anthony Crosland had tried to offer a &#8220;reformism of hope&#8221;, all
that Blair could promise was a &#8220;reformism of despair&#8221;. <a href="#n78" name="f78">[78]</a>
Lindsey German&#8217;s <em>The Blair Project Cracks</em> <a href="#n79" name="f79">[79]</a>
made a devastating critique of Tony Blair&#8217;s record in power before
his entanglement in foreign wars and her <em>How Labour Lost Its Roots</em>
described &#8220;disillusion and despair&#8221; among Labour Party activists.
<a href="#n80" name="f80">[80]</a></p>

<p>The Seattle demonstrations of November 1999 gave rise to a new
international anti-capitalist movement which in the post-9/11 world
merged into a massive anti-war movement. The new challenges of the
period were covered extensively in the journal. Chris Harman&#8217;s
<em>Anti-capitalism: Theory and Practice</em> stressed that &#8220;it is up
to all of us to help build the new movement&#8221; but warned that
&#8220;clarity of ideas is not a luxury in such cases&#8221;. <a href="#n81" name="f81">[81]</a>
Several other articles in the same spirit followed.</p>

<p>John Rees&#8217;s <em>The Broad Party, the Revolutionary Party and the
United Front</em> confronted some of the problems posed by united
fronts and electoral alliances in a new phase of activity noting that
&#8220;the most difficult struggles and the toughest decisions still lie
ahead&#8221;. <a href="#n82" name="f82">[82]</a> Paul McGarr&#8217;s <em>Why
Green is Red: Marxism and the Threat to the Environment</em> provided
a valuable introduction to the emerging issues of environmental
politics deploying extensive scientific knowledge in terms easily
grasped by the lay reader. <a href="#n83" name="f83">[83]</a> His
<em>Capitalism and Climate Change</em> gave an equally lucid account of
21st century barbarism&#8217;s most menacing face. <a href="#n84" name="f84">[84]</a>
He concluded grimly:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The record of human history is that those who control
societies have often been prepared to see the whole of society plunge
into disastrous chaos and collapse rather than accept change which
undermined their power. I see no reason to suppose the most powerful
ruling class in human history, those who today head the giant global
corporations at whose centre stand the fossil fuel corporations, will
behave any differently to their predecessors whose societies&#8217; fate
is witnessed only by ruined monuments.</p>

<p class="fst">When <strong>Socialist Review</strong> celebrated its 200th issue in 1996
Tony Cliff stated that he hoped there would not be another 200
issues, for he expected the revolution would come by then. Whether
there will be another 50 years of <strong>International Socialism</strong> we
do not know, and I for one am unlikely to find out. But at a time
when capitalism is &#8220;an unconscionable time a-dying&#8221; and the
prospect of what Marx called the &#8220;common ruin of the contending
classes&#8221; is ever more likely, we need a Marxism like that of Cliff
and Kidron that is unafraid to confront new and changing realities.</p>

<p>As the founders of this journal wrote 50 years ago in words still
relevant today:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Marxism has a crucial role to play. A science of action,
constantly assimilating and formulating the experiences of the
international working class, it is the most biting weapon in the
struggle against class society ...</p>

<p class="quote">We present <strong>International Socialism</strong> as a small
contribution to Marxist thought. Its function is to bring the
traditions of scientific socialism to bear on the constantly changing
pattern of class struggle, to help clarify its nature and,
conversely, to keep the science of working class action a living one
and not the compendium of quotations to which it is so often and so
tragically reduced.</p>
