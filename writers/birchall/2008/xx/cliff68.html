<p class="fst">Revolutionaries do not determine events, nor do they predict them.
<a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a> Lenin was surprised by both 1905 and
1917. What revolutionaries can do is understand events and develop a
strategy to take advantage of them. &#8220;All revolutions in history
have begun spontaneously. None have ended so.&#8221; <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>
At a time when the momentous events of 1968 are being commemorated,
it is interesting to look at how a revolutionary socialist, Tony
Cliff, the founder of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and its
predecessors, responded to them.</p>

<p>The events of 1968 developed at a hectic pace. For the
revolutionary left it was the most important turning point since
1945. The Tet offensive in Vietnam showed that the world&#8217;s biggest
military power was vulnerable, producing a political crisis in the US
in which Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were killed. The
Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia marked the end of a monolithic
international Communist movement. Student revolts erupted around the
world. The Ford sewing machinists&#8217; strike for equal pay launched
the women&#8217;s movement in Britain, and in Northern Ireland the civil
rights movement was born. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></p>

<p>In Britain possibilities for the far left had been improving for
some time. A Labour government, elected with high hopes in 1964 and
re-elected with a massive majority in 1966, had alienated much of its
support with policies that attacked the working class, and slavish
support for the Americans in Vietnam.</p>

<p>In October 1967 and March 1968 there were two large, militant
demonstrations against the Vietnam War. Many of those involved were
students, and as the Labour government rapidly expanded higher
education to modernise British capitalism, many students were drawn
towards a radical critique of society. A long occupation at the
London School of Economics (LSE) in 1967, protesting at the
appointment as director of an active supporter of the racist regime
in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), marked the beginning of the student movement
in Britain. There were various student actions in the first months of
1968.</p>
<p>Another symptom of the growing ferment on the left was the
publication in 1967 of the <strong>May Day Manifesto</strong> in the names of
Stuart Hall, Raymond Williams and Edward Thompson. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a>
This reflected a real revulsion towards the Labour government&#8217;s
policies. Its contradictions were neatly summed up by Peter Sedgwick:</p>

<p class="quoteb">So far the manifesto campaign does not appear to be on
its way to selecting revolutionaries, or possible revolutionaries.
Several of the sponsors I know to be zombies or faint-hearts who have
no intention whatsoever of carrying through the manifesto&#8217;s
purported aims. Whatever the future of its ambitions, however, the
manifesto will remain the most readily available and on the whole
best written summary of Wilsonism&#8217;s crimes. It deserves its
excellent sale. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a></p>

<p class="fst">But the milieu open to serious socialist ideas was expanding.</p>

<p>For socialists in Britain two events in 1968 were paramount. In
April Tory MP Enoch Powell made a viciously racist speech predicting
violence &#8211; a river &#8220;foaming with much blood&#8221;. Various groups of
workers, including traditionally militant London dockers, took strike
action in his support. This was a tremendous blow to left wing
activists; as one wrote at the time:</p>

<p class="quoteb">I remember Nigel walking into the room with this <strong>Evening
Standard</strong> headline ... We were just completely shocked numb ...
You suddenly realised how little influence the left really had, how
the roots of the political organisations like the Communist Party had
been rotting in the soil. How pathetic the squabbling between groups
all was. Just how urgent things had become ... I seemed to spend the
next few days leafleting solidly and I&#8217;ll never forget the look on
the faces of the Pakistani postmen when they read the leaflets and
found out they weren&#8217;t fascist. For those few days after Powell,
they were petrified. But so was I. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></p>

<p class="fst">This alarming prospect was followed almost immediately by the news
that just over the channel in France some ten million workers had
stopped work, many of them occupying their workplaces. For a
generation to whom even the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was no more
than a childhood memory, this created an unprecedented situation, in
which ideas like &#8220;revolution&#8221; and &#8220;working class power&#8221;
stopped being items of abstract debate and became realities on their
television screens.</p>

<p>It was also the occasion of the re-emergence of the revolutionary
left. Within the French student milieu there were a number of
revolutionary groupings &#8211; Maoists, Trotskyists and anarchists. They
were small in size (what the Communist Party dismissively referred to
as <em>groupuscules</em>), with a total membership of at best a few
thousand. But in a situation of rising struggle they set differences
aside, and were sufficiently strong to attract public attention. In
June the government banned 11 of the groups.</p>

<p>The stark juxtaposition of these two events showed enormous
dangers and great possibilities.</p>

<p>Tony Cliff (Ygael Gluckstein) was born in Palestine, and spent
years trying, without much success, to build an internationalist,
anti-Zionist organisation there. He came to Britain in 1946 and in
1950 formed the Socialist Review Group. In the 1950s he wrote books
on state capitalism in Russia, China and Eastern Europe. In the early
1960s the organisation, now renamed the International Socialism (IS)
group, grew through entry work in the Labour Party Young Socialists,
and counted its members in hundreds rather than tens. When the Labour
government&#8217;s policies produced a rising level of industrial
struggle, Cliff and Colin Barker wrote a book called <strong>Incomes
Policy, Legislation and Shop Stewards</strong> <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a>,
which looked to the emergence of a socialist movement out of the
localised struggles of trade unionists.</p>

<p>Cliff quickly grasped the importance of the emerging student
movement. As John Rose, an LSE student in 1967, recalls, Cliff &#8220;began
spending a lot of time talking to student activists&#8221; and spoke at a
teach-in about the 1967 Middle East war. Rose, a Zionist, was
convinced and joined IS, as did a number of other LSE students. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a></p>

<p>At the beginning of 1968 Cliff had just turned 50, an age at which
many tend to become less energetic and more set in their ways. IS had
some 447 members. It was the biggest organisation Cliff had ever
belonged to. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a> It was a tiny group, yet
without the base and the orientation established before 1968, the
breakthrough could not have taken place &#8211; if IS had begun the year
with only 200 members, it might have ended up with few more.</p>

<p>It is highly unlikely that Cliff had any inkling of the events
that would shake the world in the coming 12 months. But the central
commitment that united his work on state capitalism to his more
recent writings on shop stewards was an unswerving belief in the
self-emancipation of the working class. It was this that enabled him
to orientate himself amid the flood of unexpected events.</p>

<p>The response to the Powell speech revealed the weakness of the
British left, what an editorial in <strong>International Socialism</strong>
described as &#8220;the vacuum on the left&#8221;. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a>
The Labour Party had made so many concessions over the question of
immigration that when racism began to get out of control it had no
response. For a fortnight after the Powell speech Wilson and other
Labour leaders remained silent, offering no answer to Powell. The
only comments came from David Ennals, a junior minister at the Home
Office. The Communist Party, which had some influence in the docks,
failed to use it to fight Powellism. Danny Lyons, a leading CP
militant, brought along two clergymen, one Catholic and one
Protestant, to try and dissuade dockers from striking.</p>

<p>IS, which had been active in support of the 1967 dock strike, had
just one docker, Terry Barrett, in membership, but he made every
effort to argue the point in class terms. Cliff recalled discussing
with Barrett late into the night as to the best way to respond to the
situation. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> Barrett distributed a
leaflet to dockers putting the class case against Powell:</p>

<p class="quoteb">Who is Enoch Powell? He is a right wing Tory opportunist
who will stop at nothing to help his party and his class ... What
does he believe in? ... <em>Mass Sackings in the Docks</em>. Again
and again he has argued that the docks are &#8220;grossly overmanned&#8221;.</p>

<p class="fst">The Powell speech led to a series of new initiatives on the part
of IS. The first was an appeal for left unity. A leaflet distributed
with the May issue of <strong>Labour Worker</strong> was headed <em>The Urgent
Challenge of Fascism</em>. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a> This
called for the establishment of a united organisation on the basis of
four points of principle:</p>

<ol>
<li>Opposition to imperialism; for the victory of all genuine
national liberation movements.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Opposition to racism in all its forms and to controls on
immigration.<br/>
&nbsp;</li>

<li>Opposition to state control of trade unions; support for
all progressive strikes.<br/>
&nbsp;</</li>

<li>Workers&#8217; control of society and industry as the only
alternative to fascism.</li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">The context of the unity proposals was well summed up a few years
later by Duncan Hallas, a veteran Trotskyist who himself rejoined IS
in 1968:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The situation in 1968 was that there was a big movement
of youth, especially student youth, towards socialist politics and
this was given organisational form by the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign
(VSC). There was a reasonable possibility that if a united
revolutionary socialist organisation could be established it would be
possible to draw in some thousands of anti-Vietnam War demonstrators.
In particular, it was hoped that the IMG <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a>
(then only two years old) would agree to unite with IS. These two
organisations had between them the dominant position in the VSC and,
if united, could probably have converted it into a revolutionary
socialist organisation of some substance. There were also prospects
that, given the impetus generated by such a unification, various New
Left <strong>May Day Manifesto</strong> elements and unaffiliated left wingers
could be drawn in.</p>

<p class="quote">Such a unified organisation, overwhelmingly student in
composition and &#8220;libertarian&#8221; and voluntaristic in sentiment,
would have had powerful ultra-left tendencies. The perspective was of
a long, hard fight inside it for marxist politics and a working class
orientation. Splits would have been inevitable. These costs were
considered acceptable in the circumstances, given the opportunity and
the urgent need to break out of small group politics. <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The IMG did not agree to unity <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a>,
and in terms of organisations the appeal achieved little. <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a>
But it was of great importance in the development of the IS group. It
established IS as the group which recognised the urgency of the
situation, which wanted a united, non-sectarian, interventionist
organisation, and which therefore became a pole of attraction for
many activists looking for a political alternative, and to whom the
debates which had divided the Trotskyist movement over the previous
20 years seemed relatively unimportant. It was undoubtedly a major
factor in IS&#8217;s rapid recruitment during the year.</p>

<p>Cliff realised that opportunities had to be grasped, and grasped
very quickly. He travelled tirelessly, speaking at meeting after
meeting, trying to convey to his audiences the urgency of the
situation. At some meetings he spoke together with Chris Pallis, the
leading figure in the Solidarity grouping, who had published a
remarkable eyewitness account of the events in Paris. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></p>

<p>At a meeting in Hornsey in north London on 29 May (the day after
the start of a six-week occupation at Hornsey College of Art) Cliff
told a large audience that capitalism and trade unions could no
longer coexist. Perhaps it would be five years, perhaps it would be
seven, before the final confrontation. He concluded, &#8220;If I am
wrong, I see you in the concentration camps.&#8221; <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></p>

<p>Over the next weeks, as the French Communist Party and the trade
union leaders succeeded in liquidating the strike movement, he
modified his analysis somewhat. Yet we should not dismiss Cliff&#8217;s
warning with the complacent wisdom of hindsight. Concentration camps
were not on the agenda for Hornsey, but just three years later, in
1971, internment would be introduced in Northern Ireland. In five
years time the Chilean coup would show just how ruthless a threatened
capitalism could be.</p>

<p>Cliff also seems to have gone through a philosophical conversion,
though with his distaste for philosophical argument he did not make
it explicit. Previously he had tended to stress the deterministic
nature of Marxism. Now there was a shift to voluntarism. As he put
it, &#8220;History, that old horse, does nothing&#8221;. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a>
Change depended on human action. He wrote, &#8220;If the study of history
&#8211; even the most recent &#8211; were enough by itself to solve political
questions, social democracy would have died a long time ago, and so
would Stalinism. Alas, this is not how history works. And there is
nothing more foreign to socialism than fatalism.&#8221; <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></p>

<p>Recognising that a more interventionist approach needed a
different form of organisation, Cliff proposed that IS should adopt a
democratic centralist structure. He argued the point in a short
document entitled <em>Notes on Democratic Centralism</em> circulated in
June 1968. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a> He began by observing
that IS had moved in recent years from being a purely propaganda
organisation, which sought to win a small audience for its ideas, to
an agitational organisation, able to intervene in the class struggle.
&#8220;A revolutionary combat organisation &#8211; especially if it becomes a
party &#8211; needs a democratic centralist structure.&#8221; Cliff justified
this with historical references to the First International and the
Bolshevik Party. A federal structure was &#8220;unstable and
inefficient&#8221;, since &#8220;a revolutionary combat organisation faces
the need for tactical decisions &#8211; daily and hourly &#8211; hence the
need for great centralisation&#8221;.</p>

<p>The actual organisational proposals were modest. The most
controversial element was the insistence on tighter discipline: &#8220;All
decisions of conferences and between conferences of the executive are
binding on all members of the organisation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The IS group had traditionally been fairly lax organisationally.
In the 18 years since the founding of the Socialist Review Group
there had been just three expulsions. Where there was little
intervention, and hence no experience to be evaluated, there was no
value in a centralised structure. There was a legitimate reaction
against the vanguardism and hyperactivism of IS&#8217;s main rival on the
far left, the Socialist Labour League.</p>

<p>The document was short &#8211; just over 1,000 words. Jim Higgins, at
that time one of Cliff&#8217;s closest allies, later argued that it was
inadequate for its purpose in introducing such a radical change. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a>
There is some truth in this. Cliff had, quite justifiably, a
considerable faith in his own ability to convince the organisation,
but perhaps he underestimated the difficulties. Among the older
membership libertarian ideas were quite deeply implanted, and most of
the new members had come from the anti-authoritarian milieu of
student struggles. Undoubtedly Cliff was impatient. He was quite
right to be so, for the opportunities offered by the unfolding
situation were immense, and there was no time to waste. Yet as Cliff
himself later noted, even amid the dramatic events of 1917 Lenin
stressed the need for patient explanation. <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></p>

<p>Cliff&#8217;s main contribution to the understanding of 1968 and the
reorientation of the organisation came in the pamphlet he wrote with
myself during the summer of 1968, <strong>France: The Struggle Goes On</strong>.
<a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a> It was written from afar. In the
heated atmosphere of 1968, Cliff, not having British citizenship,
could not travel abroad for fear that he might not be permitted to
return. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25]</a> But he had long
discussions with various French activists who visited London,
including two leading members of the French Trotskyist organisation
<em>Lutte Ouvri&#232;re</em>.</p>

<p>The pamphlet gave a narrative account of the French events,
stressing the centrality of working class struggle and the
development of the factory occupations. It thus contrasted with other
analyses then available in English. Chris Pallis&#8217;s eyewitness
account gave a vivid description of the rising movement, but ended
too soon to show how the bureaucrats had regained control. The
Penguin book by Seale and McConville <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a>
focused largely on the student movement. <a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a>
For Cliff the main lesson of the French experience was clear:</p>

<p class="quoteb">None of the capitalist powers of our era is stable enough
to be immune from proletarian revolution ... France has shown, more
clearly even than Hungary or the Belgian general strike, that the
working class of the advanced countries has not been bribed or
integrated into complacency, but retains enormous revolutionary potential.</p>

<p class="fst">He examined the history of working class grievances before 1968,
the &#8220;dry tinder&#8221; before the conflagration. Above all he stressed
the need for &#8220;strike committees democratically elected by all
workers, union or non-union&#8221;. In a situation where perhaps only a
quarter of the ten million strikers were unionised, fetishising the
union structure could only be a brake on the movement. If such
committees had existed, &#8220;they would have been basically the same as
the soviets of 1917 or the workers&#8217; councils of Hungary in 1956&#8221;.
He showed the difficulties the union bureaucracy had in bringing the
strike to an end, and the various ways in which they manipulated the
ballots. The strike broke down barriers between economic and
political struggle, and he judged that the situation in May had been
&#8220;pre-revolutionary, potentially revolutionary&#8221;.</p>

<p>Beyond this Cliff set out to confront a number of more general
issues raised by the French events. First, there was the question of
the new student movement, something of great strategic importance for
building a revolutionary organisation in Britain. In France students
had acted as the &#8220;detonator&#8221; for a mass working class struggle,
but in Britain the left was divided as to what attitude to take to
student struggles. On the one hand there were those who still saw
students as the small privileged minority who had scabbed on the
General Strike of 1926. On the other there were those who saw
students as a replacement for the traditional role of the working
class. The new radical newspaper <strong>Black Dwarf</strong> had just appeared
with the slogan &#8220;Students: The New Revolutionary Vanguard&#8221;. <a href="#n28" name="f28">[28]</a>
An ultra-left current in the student movement thought that provoking
clashes with the police, or building barricades in Hyde Park <a href="#n29" name="f29">[29]</a>,
would be sufficient to &#8220;detonate&#8221; mass struggles in Britain,
forgetting that detonators without explosives are singularly useless.</p>

<p>In seeking to avoid both extremes, Cliff noted that traditionally
students had identified with bourgeois values. But over recent years
student numbers in Britain and throughout the world had increased
massively: &#8220;The majority of students are not being trained any more
as future members of the ruling class ... but as white-collar
employees of state and industry, and thus are destined to be part and
parcel of the proletariat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cliff located the upheaval in higher education in terms of
contradictions within capitalism:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The central contradiction of capitalism is that between
the production of what Marx called use-values, and the production of
value. The first are natural. The second are specific to the
capitalist order of society. In the university this is reflected as a
contradiction between the ideal of unlimited intellectual
development, free from social, political and ideological restraint,
and the tight intellectual reins imposed by capitalism. The liberal
mystique of education clashes with its social content.</p>

<p class="fst">Cliff argued that, whereas workers&#8217; militancy began from trade
union consciousness, students tended to think in abstracts: &#8220;Behind
the complaint about the tangible reality of low grants, bad food,
strict rules and overcrowded amenities, the student feels the
intangible manipulation of his mind.&#8221; As a result, &#8220;students at
present rebel more readily than workers because they are less
shackled mentally by the traditional ... organisations ... The
rootlessness of the student acts as oil to the wheels of revolt.&#8221;
(Whatever else had changed, Cliff had not lost his taste for mixed metaphor.)</p>

<p>Cliff&#8217;s observations here were no more than a first
approximation. Much more could and would be said about the political
role of students in the coming years. <a href="#n30" name="f30">[30]</a>
But Cliff&#8217;s analysis provided the crucial argument that student
struggles were of immense importance, but could only succeed if
linked to the working class movement.</p>

<p>He warned, &#8220;We must expect many zigzags in the struggle, from
economic strikes to political battles and vice versa.&#8221; As a counter
to the optimism of those who believed that the French struggle would
revive in the autumn, he stressed, &#8220;The long haul ahead will be the
work of years, rather than of months.&#8221;</p>

<p>In political terms he predicted the decline of the French
Communist Party, which would find it increasingly difficult &#8220;to
retain custody of the working class&#8221;, since &#8220;Moscow has lost its
magical influence in the world&#8221;. <a href="#n31" name="f31">[31]</a>
In the short term he was wrong &#8211; the French Communist Party grew
considerably in the 1970s. In the longer term his prediction was
fully justified.</p>

<p>Comparing the British movement to the French, he argued that
Britain had certain advantages: the Labour Party was less able to
hold back struggle than the French CP, and the British shop stewards&#8217;
organisation made the class much stronger. His conclusion was optimistic:</p>

<p class="quoteb">France today, Britain tomorrow! We cannot be sure of the
rhythm of events, but there can be no doubt that there will be an
acceleration ... We cannot gauge the timing, duration and sweep of
the coming revolutionary crisis in British capitalism, but it is not
far off.</p>

<p class="fst">Within less than six years industrial action would bring down a
Tory government.</p>

<p>Cliff&#8217;s main aim in the pamphlet was to argue for an immediate
strategy of building a revolutionary party, a sharp shift in the
orientation of IS. The need for such a party was argued concretely,
on the basis of the experience of the French struggle. Describing how
the bureaucracy manipulated the return to work, Cliff commented,
&#8220;What a difference would have been made by a revolutionary party
with a daily newspaper and possibly even a radio transmitter!&#8221;
Without such a party, French students and workers had built action
committees to fill the gap: &#8220;As a substitute soviet that did not
exist and a substitute revolutionary party that did not exist, arose
the action committees! What a magnificent improvisation!&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a &#8220;credible revolutionary alternative&#8221;, he warned, the
betrayals of the bureaucracies could be repeated. He concluded with
the classic arguments for the revolutionary party:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The revolutionary party is, so to say, the memory of the
class, the store of experience of the class struggle internationally,
the university of the class. Facing the strictly centralised and
disciplined power of the capitalists there must be no less
centralised and disciplined a combat organisation of the proletariat.</p>

<p class="fst">Production of the pamphlet strained the resources of a tiny group
already preparing to produce a weekly paper. <a href="#n32" name="f32">[32]</a>
Nonetheless it was widely read and created a certain amount of
interest in student circles. It received a recommendation in the
austere pages of <strong>New Left Review</strong> <a href="#n33" name="f33">[33]</a>
and was rapidly translated and published in Japanese. <a href="#n34" name="f34">[34]</a></p>

<p>Despite the cogency of the pamphlet Cliff underestimated the
difficulties of persuading the membership to accept a new
constitution based on democratic centralist principles. He later
admitted, &#8220;I myself was panicked by the situation.&#8221; <a href="#n35" name="f35">[35]</a>
Even Mike Kidron, his long term ally in the organisation, had
reservations about Cliff&#8217;s position on democratic centralism,
believing there should be a balance between a centrally elected
political committee and a delegate executive. He wrote a document
arguing this entitled <em>We are Not Peasants</em>. <a href="#n36" name="f36">[36]</a>
A stormy conference in September proved unable to resolve the
situation. It was agreed that there would be a recall conference in
December. This led to the most heated internal discussion the
organisation had ever seen. Finally the December conference agreed a
new constitution. A national committee of 40 was elected by
conference, which in turn elected a London-based executive.</p>

<p>The constitution had been changed, but as Cliff, always opposed to
formalism, well knew, the constitution was the least important thing.
It merely opened the way for the real task, transforming and building
the organisation. This would have to be done in a situation where the
pace of events was accelerating.</p>

<p>At the end of 1968 IS had perhaps a thousand members. The task of
building an independent revolutionary organisation had only just
begun (until 1968 most IS members were still in the Labour Party,
though activity in the Labour Party had declined sharply over the
previous couple of years).</p>

<p>Central to IS&#8217;s new orientation was the weekly <strong>Socialist
Worker</strong>, produced with a staff of three from a tiny printshop near
the Tottenham Hotspur football ground. The new paper was something of
a gamble (a few years earlier a fortnightly paper had been
unsuccessful), but it aimed to relate the international mood to the
industrial struggle at home. The first issue, dated 7 September 1968,
led with an article by engineering worker Roger Cox: &#8220;No Retreat!
Engineers Can Smash Pay Freeze&#8221;, next to a picture of Czech
students climbing onto a Russian tank. Many years later Jim Nichol,
the paper&#8217;s first business manager, recalled:</p>

<p class="quoteb">We needed a paper that workers would engage with. It
couldn&#8217;t afford to be filled with worthy tracts that militants
never read. And it had to be sold by workers, not just IS members. We
needed shop stewards and other militants to see it as their paper.
<a href="#n37" name="f37">[37]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The paper was rather scruffy, had just four pages &#8211; and was very
cheap, costing two pence. <a href="#n38" name="f38">[38]</a> From the
second issue it bore the slogan &#8220;The 2d paper that fights for YOU&#8221;.
The initial print run was 8,000. It was sold at factory gates and on
high streets. Each issue contained contact details for IS&#8217;s 47
branches, under the heading &#8220;Join International Socialism &#8211; For a
Real Alternative to Capitalism and Stalinism&#8221;. Although Cliff did
not contribute to the early issues of the paper (he was busy
elsewhere, notably fundraising), he took a keen interest in its progress.</p>

<p>Early in 1969 Cliff wrote a document with the mundane title <em>On
Perspectives</em>. <a href="#n39" name="f39">[39]</a> It was one of
his most thoughtful and perceptive articles. He assessed the
situation after 1968, and set out the tasks for IS in the coming
years. He stressed that what was now needed was &#8220;not a euphoric
generalisation ... but a sober analysis&#8221;. The French pamphlet had
aimed to show the possibilities; now he stressed the harsh realities.
The French strike had ended in stalemate, and it was necessary to
recognise both the weakness of the revolutionary left and the
resilience of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>This led to a discussion of class consciousness. The long post-war
boom had seen an increasing alienation of workers from their
traditional organisations. &#8220;It is true that the Labour Party has
six million members, but it is doubtful if 10 percent of these know
they are members.&#8221; Whereas the Russian Revolution had sprung from a
growing politicisation of the working class, the French events had
&#8220;followed years of depoliticisation&#8221;. Formerly class
consciousness could be deduced from &#8220;institutional barometers&#8221;
such as party membership, newspaper readership, etc. But now &#8220;the
deep alienation of workers from traditional organisations smashed all
such barometers to pieces&#8221;.</p>

<p>So class struggle became much more unpredictable: &#8220;When the path
of individual reforms is being narrowed, or closed &#8211; apathy can
transform into its opposite, swift mass action.&#8221; The consequences
were not necessarily progressive: &#8220;A declining interest in the
traditional reformist organisations ... does not mean the <em>overcoming</em>
of reformist ideology.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went on to examine the current economic perspectives. The
permanent arms economy had not reached its end, but it was past its peak:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The stability of Western capitalism is beginning to
falter. This does not mean that Western capitalism is faced with
collapse, as in the thirties. In the coming years we can expect an
unevenness in the rate of economic growth, and intermittent expansions.</p>

<p class="fst">In this he was to be proved right. The 1973 oil crisis would mark
the end of the boom, with a rapid rise in unemployment, but it was
not a collapse on the 1929 scale, and it did not end working class
resistance. Ahead lay increasing instability and a situation in which
independent shopfloor organisation would be less tolerated.</p>

<p>The overall situation was uneven and contradictory: &#8220;The picture
is mosaic, patchy and inelegant.&#8221; It was necessary to find ways of
overcoming fragmentation: &#8220;We cannot follow the syndicalists in
idolising fragmented militancy&#8221;. <a href="#n40" name="f40">[40]</a>
Sectional militancy did not automatically produce an understanding of
the general situation; hence the same workers could be militant
industrially but also racist. He pointed to ways in which the
fragmentation of resistance could be overcome. A government incomes
policy meant that workers had to confront the state. The new trend to
productivity deals (in which workers negotiated on working conditions
and traditional working practices as well as wages) would directly
raise the question of workers&#8217; control.</p>

<p>Cliff also drew attention to the way the French events had
highlighted the division between young workers and older workers.
Young workers were more self-confident, less bound by trade union
traditions than their older workmates. However, they could not
sustain their struggle except in unity with older workers in their workplace.</p>

<p>He argued that &#8220;transitional programmes of demands connecting
the particular with the general are needed&#8221;. This was not a revival
of Trotsky&#8217;s abstract and outdated <strong>Transitional Programme</strong> of
1938, but programmes geared to &#8220;the specific conditions of
different industries, different plants, etc.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cliff also pointed to the facts that shopfloor organisation was
under ever-increasing threat and that the trade union bureaucracy was
&#8220;both reformist and cowardly&#8221;. The struggle for trade union
democracy, for &#8220;workers&#8217; control of the trade unions&#8221;, would
become important.</p>

<p>As Cliff noted, &#8220;The old forest of reformism is withering away.&#8221;
In particular the Communist Party was becoming increasingly
irrelevant and divided. In 1969 the Communist Party still had a much
larger organisation and much deeper roots in the working class than
all the revolutionary groups combined. But Cliff was quite right to
foresee that the next two decades would be a time of bitter splits
and remorseless decline for the Communist Party until it finally
liquidated itself in 1991. <a href="#n41" name="f41">[41]</a> Cliff
could foresee the very real possibility that IS could replace the
Communists as the main militant force in the trade union movement.
Before 1968 such a prospect would have seemed very distant.</p>

<p>In concluding, Cliff made a point he would repeat throughout his
life, that change in consciousness can come only through struggle:
&#8220;Reformism can never be defeated by programmes. It can only be
defeated by deeds ... Only struggle discloses to the workers the
magnitude of the struggle, widens their horizons, and clarifies their mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hence revolutionaries had to be always ready to learn and to
experiment, making mistakes and correcting them. They must not
retreat into purely theoretical activity. On the contrary, in a
phrase he would use again and again, it was necessary to &#8220;raise
theory to the level of practice&#8221;. The &#8220;do-it-yourself reformism&#8221;
of recent years had meant increased self-confidence, but at the price
of a decline in more general class consciousness. Cliff rarely
resorted to dialectical terminology, but here he made a cogent
summary of the new possibilities:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The third stage the British working class has entered is
a &#8220;negation of the negation&#8221;, synthesising elements of the first
stage (the 1920s and 1930s) &#8211; class identification &#8211; and of the
second stage (1945&#8211;65) &#8211; self-confidence. The synthesis is higher
than the individual elements joined in it and pregnant of great
revolutionary possibilities.</p>

<p class="fst">1968 saw a major change in IS and in Cliff himself. But it is
important to be clear as to what the nature of the change was. It is
often alleged that in 1968 he switched from Luxemburgism to Leninism.
This is a misleading oversimplification. There is no such clearly
defined doctrine as &#8220;Luxemburgism&#8221;. Rosa Luxemburg gave great
importance to spontaneity, but she also spent most of her life in a
Marxist party. &#8220;Leninism&#8221; is also a rather slippery concept, and
Cliff&#8217;s interpretation of Lenin was far from a conventional one.</p>

<p>Cliff had always been a great admirer of Lenin. His 1947 document
on state capitalism had been Leninist (unlike some versions of state
capitalism), because it regarded Stalinism as a negation of what
Bolshevism had stood for in 1917. One of the great weaknesses of the
orthodox Trotskyist analysis was that it claimed workers&#8217; states
could be established without a revolutionary party. In his 1959 book
on Rosa Luxemburg the references to Lenin are frequently positive.</p>

<p>In 1968 he turned back to Lenin because he thought there were new
things to be learnt. In the summer of 1968, while working on the
French pamphlet, he was rereading his way through the complete works
of Lenin, piled up on the floor of the front room of his Stoke
Newington home. <a href="#n42" name="f42">[42]</a> The shifts in his
position were a response to the changes in the real world rather than
a radical reconsideration of his political philosophy. In particular
Cliff did not make a dichotomy between spontaneity and organisation.
Like Luxemburg he attributed great value to spontaneous working class
action, and insisted that revolutionaries had to learn from the
working class. He also gave enormous importance to conscious
organisation, but believed that the form of organisation must be
flexible according to circumstances. In real life spontaneity and
organisation are always closely intertwined. <a href="#n43" name="f43">[43]</a></p>

<p>The myth of a Luxemburgism-Leninism transition has been greatly
encouraged by the story of the new edition of his 1959 book on Rosa
Luxemburg, which was produced early in 1969. This story has been much
misused by Cliff&#8217;s opponents. The new edition contained two
alterations. These amounted to no more than a few lines out of 80
pages of text. Cliff saw no reason to amend the vast majority of what
he had written ten years earlier. One alteration concerned the 1959
formulation, &#8220;For Marxists, in advanced industrial countries,
Lenin&#8217;s original position can serve much less as a guide than Rosa
Luxemburg&#8217;s, notwithstanding her overstatements on the question of
spontaneity.&#8221; This now became, &#8220;However, whatever the historical
circumstances moulding Rosa&#8217;s thought regarding organisation, these
thoughts showed a great weakness in the German Revolution of 1918&#8211;9&#8221;. <a href="#n44" name="f44">[44]</a></p>

<p>The changes were significant, and reflected the way Cliff had
rethought his position in the light of the events of 1968 (it would
be a strange revolutionary who did not engage in some rethinking in
the light of the biggest strike in history). But they did not show
any deviation in his concern, in 1969 as in 1959, to assess the
contributions of two great revolutionaries and show how their thought
could be applied in the present. <a href="#n45" name="f45">[45]</a></p>

<p>Through his writing, speaking and arguments with comrades, Cliff
played a major role in reorienting the organisation in the course of
1968. The coming decade was to justify him. The years from 1968 to
1980 were to be the most favourable for revolutionaries since the
1920s. In Chile, Portugal, Iran and Poland there were &#8220;revolutionary
rehearsals&#8221;. <a href="#n46" name="f46">[46]</a> Massive strike
waves rocked Italy and Spain. In Britain 1972 saw the Saltley picket,
where miners and engineering workers united to win a pit strike by
mass picketing. Later that year the threat of general strike action
forced the release of dockers imprisoned under the government&#8217;s
anti-union laws. In 1974 another miners&#8217; strike brought down the
Tory government and put Labour back in power &#8211; the only time in
British history that strike action has brought down a government.</p>

<p>Throughout Europe the revolutionary left grew rapidly, showing the
great possibilities that were available. But by the end of the decade
much of the left was in crisis. <a href="#n47" name="f47">[47]</a>
Many swung to the right, while some turned to terrorism. The relative
success of the SWP in holding together since 1980 cannot be
attributed to any individual, but undeniably Cliff played an
important part. 1968 showed both his clarity of analysis and his
capacity to enthuse. A study of his role can help us face the
problems of the future.</p>

the Socialist Labour League (SLL), was incurably sectarian. In
October 1968, when 100,000 people marched against the Vietnam war,
SLL members turned up to give out a leaflet headed <em>Why The
Socialist Labour League Is Not Marching</em>. For the text of this
amazing piece of sectarian stupidity, see Widgery, 1976, p.&nbsp;349.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f16" name="n16">16.</a> The only &#8220;success&#8221; was the
entry into IS of Workers&#8217; Fight, a small group which was the
forerunner of today&#8217;s Alliance for Workers&#8217; Liberty, though it
had rather mechanical orthodox Trotskyist politics then. It was never
a real fusion: WF retained its own probationary membership,
subscriptions and disciplinary structures. The fusion was terminated
by a special conference in 1971.</p>

The reference was to Lenin, 1960.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f24" name="n24">24.</a> I should clarify my own role in
the pamphlet. I wrote most of the three chapters on the Communist
Party and the non-Communist left, and provided material on the
strikes and occupations. All the theoretical analysis was Cliff&#8217;s.
I had been asked to provide Cliff with &#8220;background&#8221; notes. When I
next saw my notes, Cliff had cut up the typescript and stapled pieces
of it onto sheets of paper, interspersed with his own handwritten
commentary. The pamphlet contained some rather inflammatory passages,
for example, &#8220;In our epoch not a single serious issue can be
decided by ballot. In the decisive class battles bullets will
decide.&#8221; Since Cliff did not have British citizenship, he was
concerned about possible reprisals, so it was agreed that I would
take responsibility for such formulations, saying that Cliff had
contributed only historical material.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f40" name="n40">40.</a> Cliff tended to use the term

was what syndicalism had meant in working class history is debatable.</p>

<p class="note"><a href="#f41" name="n41">41.</a> The CP did enjoy a slight
recovery in the 1970s, but mainly as the organisation of the

<p class="note"><a href="#f43" name="n43">43.</a> He would probably have agreed
with Daniel Gu&#233;rin, who argued that &#8220;pure&#8221; spontaneity was a
myth, since spontaneous action is a product of conscious

<p class="note"><a href="#f45" name="n45">45.</a> There was no intention of
suggesting that Cliff had always held the same view. In the new
edition the changes were inserted in a different typeface so that
they were visible at a glance. Unfortunately in a meeting, perhaps
flustered or impatient, Cliff denied that he had made any
alterations. It was a foolish action which caused more trouble than
it was worth.</p>
