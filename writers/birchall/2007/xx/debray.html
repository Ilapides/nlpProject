<p class="fst">R&#233;gis Debray<br/>
<strong>Praised Be Our Lords</strong><br/>
<em>Verso, 2007, &#163;9.99</em></p>

<p class="fst">R&#233;gis Debray first came to prominence in the 1960s when he
published various articles and a short book, <strong>Revolution in the
Revolution?</strong>, about guerrilla struggles in Latin America. This
aroused considerable interest because a new generation of the left
was eager to discover revolutionary movements independent of both
Washington and Moscow.</p>

<p>The Latin American guerrilla struggles, beginning with the Cuban
Revolution, had rejected the orthodoxies of Stalinism. But as Debray
showed, they had also rejected the basics of Marxism. Debray stressed
the importance of small revolutionary groups acting in isolation,
remote from any proletarian or peasant base. As he put it, &#8220;The
mountain proletarianises the bourgeois and peasant elements, and the
city can bourgeoisify the proletarians.&#8221;</p>

<p>Debray was adopted by the Cuban leadership, and went to Bolivia to
join Che Guevara&#8217;s guerrilla group shortly before Che&#8217;s murder.
Debray spent nearly four years in a Bolivian jail and then went to
Chile, where he wrote a book based on conversations with the
president, Salvador Allende, defending Chile&#8217;s parliamentary road
to socialism. He claims that &#8220;it never occurred to me for a single
moment&#8221; that Allende&#8217;s rule would end with bloody overthrow.</p>

<p>Debray&#8217;s analyses were soon overtaken by events. The Cuban
Revolution had succeeded in a unique historical conjuncture which was
not to be repeated; when Castro tried to declare independence from
Washington, he soon found himself trapped as sugar supplier to the
rival empire in Moscow. Guevara died a heroic but futile death, and
by the early 1970s the wave of guerrilla struggle was largely
exhausted. Allende was overthrown by a vicious right wing coup.</p>

<p>For Debray it looked like the end of a promising career. But when
Fran&#231;ois Mitterrand was elected president of France in 1981 he
appointed Debray as a &#8220;special adviser&#8221; on foreign affairs. At
first sight it was an odd choice. After what had happened to Guevara
and Allende, Debray could hardly be seen as a lucky mascot. And given
the quality of his previous predictions, the standard of advice he
could offer was scarcely guaranteed. But then, as Debray wryly notes,
Mitterrand never listened to his advice anyway.</p>

<p>It seems more likely that Mitterrand imagined that Debray&#8217;s
reputation would enhance the president&#8217;s left image while he
pursued ever more right wing policies. The United States, for whom
such Gallic subtlety was a bit much, tried to get Debray&#8217;s
diplomatic passport withdrawn. Debray did, however, do a number of
odd jobs for Mitterrand, and acted as ghost writer: &#8220;I could churn
out kilometres of pure Mitterrand non-stop.&#8221; He finally resigned in
1988, noting that there was nothing socialist or even republican
about Mitterrand&#8217;s policies. True enough, but he took his time
noticing it.</p>

<p>This book consists of Debray&#8217;s memories of his experiences with
Castro, Guevara, Allende and Mitterrand. Contrary to the front cover,
it is not an &#8220;autobiography&#8221; (the French original makes no such
claim, but merely subtitles the work &#8220;a political education&#8221;). It
contains only a few mentions of Debray&#8217;s student days &#8211; he
studied under the Stalinist anti-humanist philosopher Louis
Althusser, which may explain a lot. And, since the French original
was published in 1996, it says nothing of the past decade, in which
Debray took part in a commission set up by President Chirac that
advocated the ban on the hijab in schools. (<strong>From Guerrilla Fighter
to Veil-Snatcher</strong> would make a nice title for an autobiography, if
he ever does write one.)</p>

<p>This is not an easy book to read. Grappling with Debray&#8217;s style
is rather like swimming in marmalade. He has obviously got through a
very large number of books. (Or am I being naive? Perhaps he just
read a library catalogue and a dictionary of quotations.) His
continual use of literary allusions constructs a protective barrier
against the reader: &#8220;If you don&#8217;t understand that, you aren&#8217;t
clever enough to be reading me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet it would be surprising if there were nothing of interest in
the memoirs of one who has associated with some of the key figures of
the left over the past 40 years. The anecdotes and observations are
often drowned amid Debray&#8217;s own rather tedious reflections on the
universe and everything, but they are there.</p>

<p>On Castro, he is quite severe. He notes that on returning to Cuba
in 1971 he found that all attempts to pursue an independent
revolutionary course had been abandoned: &#8220;What had been restless or
anxious about the man seemed to have congealed or stiffened ...
Seized by totemic solemnity, my companion was well on the way to
being certain of everything, and deaf to everyone.&#8221; The man who had
once described Russia as &#8220;a giant country run by midgets&#8221; now
praised Moscow&#8217;s representatives.</p>

<p>Debray attempts no explanation of why Cuba&#8217;s bid for
independence failed, but he shows how bureaucracy became established.
He adds that Castro is a man &#8220;for whom theory has never been a
problem, has no interest in debating ideas and never listens to an
adversary&#8217;s argument&#8221;.</p>

<p>Guevara gets equally harsh treatment. What had seemed virtues in
the 1960s are now viewed more critically. His leadership style is
summed up as &#8220;not giving a damn really whether anyone understood
him or not; not bothering to acquire the means to win the &#8216;masses&#8217;
over to his point of view, as politicians do. Not even his own
lieutenants: he never explained orders, briefed the men, asked them
any questions or invited them to speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>Guevara went to Bolivia &#8220;without any political, geographical or
social survey of the terrain, without trying to set up any sort of
support network in the region or to recruit a single Bolivian from
the region&#8221;. Debray eventually concludes that &#8220;Che Guevara went
to Bolivia not to win, but to lose&#8221;. This can only be psychological
speculation, but Debray is sufficiently well informed to make us
think twice about drawing tactical, as distinct from moral, lessons
from Guevara.</p>

<p>Mitterrand, by contrast, gets a much easier ride. Debray tells us
nothing of the failure of his initial reflationary economic policies
and his consequent swing to the right, nor of how his electoral
manoeuvring gave an initial boost to the Front National (Le Pen&#8217;s
name never appears in the book).</p>

<p>Debray is well aware of the shifts and turns in Mitterrand&#8217;s
career, how he started out as a right wing anti-Gaullist and then
&#8220;recycled the credo of his youth into a left anti-Gaullism&#8221;.
Mitterrand was &#8220;a socialist advancing the cause of advanced
liberalism&#8221;, a secularist encouraging church education, &#8220;the
signatory of a party congress motion calling for a break with
capitalism adopting the country&#8217;s most right wing finance policy
since the liberation&#8221;. He could &#8220;talk revolution in public and
police surveillance in private&#8221;. Indeed, he had &#8220;an allergy ...
to the very idea of truth&#8221;.</p>

<p>And yet Debray calls the old crook &#8220;a decent man&#8221; (the
original French <em>pudique</em> is stronger than &#8220;decent&#8221;,
implying reserve and discretion). Clearly truth, let alone socialist
principle, is not a value of any great importance to Debray. He
protects himself from criticism by adopting an ironic,
self-deprecating stance. The Mitterrand years were &#8220;no big deal&#8221;,
leaving a &#8220;sense of artificiality and emptiness&#8221;. He justifies
his jesting tone by noting that &#8220;at court, more than elsewhere,
truth comes from the mouths of buffoons&#8221;.</p>

<p>In any case, none of it matters. Debray concludes that, although
progress is possible in technology, it is meaningless in politics.
This, of course, is the delusion of an intellectual, comparing
himself to Victor Hugo or whoever. Life is no paradise for French
workers today, but it is a sight better than it was a century ago,
thanks to the great struggles of 1936 and 1968, and a thousand
smaller battles.</p>

<p>Debray protests vigorously that he is no renegade from leftism,
that he was never a leftist. He was &#8220;repelled&#8221; by the &#8220;anarchist
psychodrama&#8221; of 1968. He even makes the preposterous claim that
there was a 20 percent suicide rate among the extreme left. Here we
can admit that Debray&#8217;s claim of consistency is valid. From the
rigorous Guevarist to Mitterrand&#8217;s errand boy, and from there to
the conservative cynicism of his memoirs, there is one constant theme
in Debray&#8217;s work &#8211; a total rejection of the idea that collective
human action could change the world for the better.</p>

<p>As I write, the press is full of furore about Alastair Campbell&#8217;s
diaries. (By the time this is published, people will be asking
&#8220;Who?&#8221;) Debray is immeasurably more cultured than Campbell, whose
literary ambitions never extended beyond his youthful efforts at
pornography. But in the end both books are testimony to the
degradation of politics in declining capitalism.</p>
