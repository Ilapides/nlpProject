<strong>Pessimism of the Intellect? A History of <em>New Left Review</em></strong><br/>
<em>Merlin, &#163;16.95</em></p>

<p class="fst">To produce uninterruptedly, every two to three months, a socialist
theoretical journal with a consistently high standard of analysis and
commentary from 1960 to the present is no small achievement. Only two
journals in Britain fit the description: <a href="http://www.isj.org.uk/" target="new"><strong>International
Socialism</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.newleftreview.org/" target="new"><strong>New
Left Review</strong></a> (<strong>NLR</strong>).</p>

<p>Though in some sense rivals, the two journals have been
complementary, and on occasion &#8211; the Revolutionary Socialist
Students&#8217; Federation and the Balkans war &#8211; have cooperated.
Anyone who (like myself) has a complete set of <strong>NLR</strong> since 1960
possesses a rich collection of contributions to socialist thought.
The left as a whole would have been poorer without <strong>NLR</strong>; any
negative comments in this review should not be seen as detracting
from that.</p>

<p>So those interested in the history of the British left should
welcome Duncan Thompson&#8217;s history of <strong>NLR</strong>. Written from a
point of view of general support for the left, it makes some sharp
and fundamental criticisms of <strong>NLR</strong>, but never in a hostile or
sectarian manner.</p>

<p><strong>NLR</strong> emerged from the aftermath of the events of 1956. In
1962 the original editorial team around the historian Edward Thompson
was replaced by a group headed by Perry Anderson. Anderson proposed
to make <strong>NLR</strong> the British equivalent of <strong>Les Temps Modernes</strong>,
the French journal founded by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945. He never came
remotely close. In its heroic years during the Algerian War <strong>Les
Temps Modernes</strong> formed a focus for the opponents of the war; it
published denunciations of torture and testimonies by French soldiers
about the brutalities of the war. It was seized four times by the
authorities in Algeria in 1957. It is hard to imagine the police
bothering to -confiscate <strong>NLR</strong>.</p>

<p>Duncan Thompson gives a careful account of NLR&#8217;s political
evolution, aptly described as &#8220;skittish&#8221; &#8211; a series of sharp
political turns made without justification or self-criticism. In its
first few years <strong>NLR</strong> had more than its share of illusions in
the modernising potential of Harold Wilson&#8217;s Labour government. But
the emergence of the student movement in 1968 produced a sharp swing
to the ultra&#8209;left. <strong>NLR</strong> argued (rightly) that ideology
was of great importance and (wrongly) that ideology was primarily the
product of intellectuals. Hence the working class could not be
approached directly; instead the student movement would produce a
Marxist intelligentsia who would bring &#8220;theory&#8221; to the working
class which was so sadly deprived of it.</p>

<p>The <strong>NLR</strong> of these years was a peculiar mixture of student
ultra-leftism (one article urged students to &#8220;behave as
provocatively as necessary and to effectively sanction the university
to the extent that they need to use force, probably the police&#8221; &#8211;
the author was &#8220;Baron&#8221; Triesman, now foreign office minister) and
esoteric theory, notably discussion of the work of Louis Althusser
who attempted a pathetic rearguard defence of Stalinism by dressing
it up in pretentious academic jargon.</p>

<p>After a brief flirtation with Maoism, <strong>NLR</strong> turned to
&#8220;Trotskyism&#8221;, though it was a Trotskyism filtered through the
work of Isaac Deutscher and Ernest Mandel. But the journal became
ever more remote from the actual course of political events &#8211;
neither the massive industrial struggles of the 1970s nor the rise of
racism made any impression on it. (I suspect Trotsky himself would
have judged <strong>NLR</strong> in the same way as he did <strong>Partisan Review</strong>:
a &#8220;small cultural monastery, guarding itself from the outside world
by scepticism, agnosticism and respectability&#8221;.)</p>

<p>Although <strong>NLR</strong> defended dissident currents in the Eastern
bloc, it continued to regard Russia and its satellites as
representing a higher form of society. So the &#8220;collapse of
Communism&#8221; in 1989 induced a considerable pessimism, and a shift
towards a far more defensive position with the advocacy of
constitutional reform, tactical voting and on occasion &#8220;market
socialism&#8221;. When <strong>NLR</strong> was relaunched in 2000 Anderson
announced that &#8220;for the first time since the Reformation, there are
no longer any significant oppositions ... within the thought-world of
the West&#8221;.</p>

<p>The root of NLR&#8217;s failure lay in a progressive distancing from
the working class movement. In its first years <strong>NLR</strong> made at
least two positive contributions. One was the production of a very
useful Penguin compilation, edited by Robin Blackburn and Alexander
Cockburn, called <strong>The Incompatibles</strong> (1967) &#8211; a set of essays
on British trade unionism (the pick of the bunch was Paul Foot on the
1966 seafarers&#8217; strike). The other was a series in <strong>NLR</strong>
entitled <em>Work</em>, overseen by Ronald Fraser. This gave
first-person accounts of the alienation experienced in everyday
employment by those in a wide variety of jobs. It pioneered later
work in the field of &#8220;oral history&#8221;.</p>

<p>But with the euphoria of 1968 this attempt at concrete engagement
with the working class disappeared, never to be seen again. From now
on if the working class appeared in the pages of <strong>NLR</strong> it was as
a concept in Marxist theory, never as the women and men in the
factory down the road whom you might join on a picket line &#8211; except
in the important case of an interview it ran with Arthur Scargill on
the mass pickets of the 1972 miners&#8217; strike.</p>

<p><strong>NLR</strong> was never the journal of an organisation. That was its
strength &#8211; as Blackburn put it, <strong>NLR</strong> was not &#8220;a journal for
recycling an already established truth&#8221; &#8211; but also its weakness.
<strong>NLR</strong> frequently wrote about &#8220;strategy&#8221;, but it was never
clear who would implement that strategy. Hence it was never tested
against reality. Lessons can be learned from a failed strategy, but
an untested hypothesis can only be eternally debated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Left clubs&#8221; founded by the first editorial team in the early
1960s soon evaporated. Although some members of the later editorial
committee were for a time members of the International Marxist Group
(IMG), there was never any close connection between <strong>NLR</strong> and
IMG activity. In the 1980s there was an attempt to expand the
editorial committee by adding a group of leading feminist writers.
One of the conditions they proposed was the establishment of
&#8220;readers&#8217; groups&#8221;. This was promptly vetoed by the existing committee.</p>

<p>Duncan Thompson has no startling revelations about the somewhat
secretive internal workings of <strong>NLR</strong>. He has worked on the basis
of printed material, without interviewing the main protagonists. He
has, however, had access to some illuminating &#8220;internal documents&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Democratic centralism&#8221; is much maligned. Yet it has some
merits compared to what was described as the &#8220;common-law variety of
democratic centralism&#8221; as practised by <strong>NLR</strong>. <strong>NLR</strong> was
produced by a small team &#8211; for years numbering no more than seven
or eight &#8211; accountable to nobody. The dominating figure was
undoubtedly Anderson, described here as &#8220;overbearing&#8221;. He is
without question a man of enormous erudition, but one who often uses
his knowledge to intimidate his readers rather than enlighten them.
The situation was further complicated by the fact that Anderson was
also the paymaster &#8211; his private income bailed out <strong>NLR</strong> in
its financial crisis in 1962. There is no indication that Anderson
actually threatened to take his bat home if his editorial will was
denied, but it must have been a factor in the minds of those concerned.</p>

<p>Anderson is a somewhat reclusive individual (as one who has been
active on the left for over 45 years, I have seen Anderson in the
flesh just once). In this he contrasts sharply with his closest ally,
Blackburn. Whatever criticisms one might make of Blackburn, he has
been an activist. At the height of the student movement of the late
1960s, he put his head on the line and lost his job at the London
School of Economics. In the early 1980s, when <strong>NLR</strong> helped to
launch a &#8220;Socialist Society&#8221;, it was Blackburn who was the
entrepreneurial driving force. Anderson made only a token appearance
at the founding conference.</p>

<p>Though small, the <strong>NLR</strong> team was never homogeneous: there
were major differences within it. But apart from periodic
resignations, these were never made clear. Preserving the cohesion of
the team was regarded as more important than political clarity.</p>
<p>The striking example is the question of Ireland. There were deep
disagreements within the committee. Some favoured the slogan &#8220;Victory
to the IRA&#8221;, while others, to put it mildly, were less
enthusiastic. This might have been a matter for debate and, at worst,
for a split. Instead, from 1970 to 1994, there was &#8220;by common
consent&#8221; silence about Ireland: this throughout a time when bombs
were exploding in the streets of Britain, and theoretical clarity &#8211;
on terrorism, on the violence of the oppressed, on national
liberation &#8211; was urgently needed.</p>

<p>In 1964 another of Anderson&#8217;s collaborators, Tom Nairn, declared
that the English working class &#8220;needed theory&#8221;. He was right.
Sadly <strong>NLR</strong>, despite its real achievements, has rarely
delivered.</p>
