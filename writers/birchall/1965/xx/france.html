<p class="quoteb">&#8216;France is the land where, more than anywhere else, the historical class struggles were each time fought put to a decision, and where, consequently, the changing political forms with which they move and in which their results are summarised have been stamped in the sharpest outlines.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">Engels&#8217; words remain valid, and the study of twentieth century France is a fascinating one for socialists. For this reason we must welcome the appearance of two books marked by academic distinction. Thompson&#8217;s work (a revised version of a book published in 1946) covers the social and political history of the whole period from the Commune to the Fifth Republic, and is necessarily sketchy. Thomson&#8217;s approach is often excessively abstract (typified by chapter headings such as <em>The National Vision</em> or <em>Has Democracy Failed?</em>) and many of his judgments are highly disputable: he sees the <em>Commune</em> as the end, not the beginning, of a revolutionary tradition, and he holds de Gaulle to be a &#8216;great leader&#8217;; but as a factual account, serving as a general introduction, it can be recommended.</p>

<p>Philip William&#8217;s <strong>Crisis and Compromise</strong>, an up-to-date version of his <strong>Politics in Post-War France</strong>, makes a far more detailed analysis of a much shorter period. He presents, after a brief historical survey of the period 1945-1958, a study of the various political parties and groupings in modern France, and of the political institutions of the Fourth Republic &#8211; an unmanageable system which the &#8216;Left&#8217;, after thirty years of inability to offer an alternative, found itself trying to defend in 1958.</p>

<p>A mass of statistics and appendices make this a standard work of reference. Did you know that Mend&#233;s-France supported German Rearmament, and that Mollet defended the Suez adventure with a quotation from Marx? That in 1956 one of Poujade&#8217;s most fruitful sources of support was from former Communist voters? What paper wrote of the Algerian Nationalists: &#8216;It is necessary to mete out the punishment they deserve to the Hitlerite killers who took part in the events of the 8th of May, and to the pseudo-nationalist leaders ...&#8217;? <strong>L&#8217;Humanit&#233;</strong>, in May 1945. But the most appealing of the book&#8217;s 1402 footnotes is one referring to the problems of the complex and obscure list system of voting: in 1951 many Communists voted Trotskyist &#8216;by mistake&#8217;!</p>
