<p class="fst">D. Widgery<BR><B>Beating Time</B><BR><I>London 1986</I></P>
<p class="fst">The revolutionary left is, in general, not very good at writing
its own history. Much of what is written is self-justifying
sectarianism, while those who have a proper recognition that their
own group is not the centre of the universe often see no point in
doing historical work. David Widgery&rsquo;s <B>Beating Time</B>  <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a>
&ndash; a history of the Anti-Nazi League and in particular of Rock
Against Racism &ndash; is therefore to be welcomed. Widgery&rsquo;s
book is not a scholarly treatise  <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a>, but a committed and passionate
account by a participant. Widgery has been savagely attacked from the
right  <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a> and must be defended; if some of his judgments inspire
reservations, they at least have the merit of initiating a useful
debate.</P>
<P><B>Beating Time</B> has two enormous merits. Firstly, it reminds
us that revolutionaries have been capable of mass mobilisation and of
affecting the course of events. The collapse of the National Front in
1979 was not inevitable; Widgery rightly makes the comparison with
the rise of Le Pen in France, where the left&rsquo;s response was
weak and belated. Certainly we must share the credit with Margaret
Thatcher, whose notorious &lsquo;swamping&rsquo; speech won many NF
votes back to the Tories. But the ANL&rsquo;s role cannot be denied.
Undoubtedly the SWP made mistakes during the ANL period, and they
must be analysed and studied. But if we had avoided the mistakes by
not taking the initiative, we should have quite simply condemned
ourselves to irrelevance.</P>
<P>Secondly, Widgery makes some perceptive comments about the
relation of form to content in political propaganda. The ANL did not
succeed simply because it had the &lsquo;right line&rsquo; on
fighting racism, but rather because of how that line was presented.
And that point has a wider relevance for the question of socialist
propaganda; as Widgery argues:</p>

<p class="quoteb">If socialism is transmitted in a deliberately doleful,
pre-electronic idiom, if its emotional appeal is to working-class
sacrifice and middle-class guilt and if its dominant medium is the
ill-printed word and the drab public procession, it will simply
bounce off people who have grown up on this side of the sixties
watershed and leave barely a dent behind. (p.&nbsp;84)</p>

<p class="fst">Widgery reminds us what we learnt in that period &ndash; and have
perhaps too lightly forgotten since. For if it is one hundred per
cent correct that in the downturn a revolutionary newspaper needs to
concentrate more on basic propaganda, to contain &lsquo;longer, more
analytical articles&rsquo;  <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a>, it is also true that good propaganda
need not be boring; indeed, one would suppose, almost by definition,
that it should not. Widgery reminds us what imagination and lively
presentation can do for the propagation of socialist ideas.</P>
<P>These are the book&rsquo;s merits, and for them alone it deserves
to be read and discussed. But behind them lie certain ambivalences,
certain questions which Widgery does not answer and which require
further clarification.</P>
<P>What was the nature of the ANL operation? We need not waste much
time on the political illiteracy current among some sectarian
opponents that the ANL was a Popular Front. The essence of the
Popular Front is unity with the political representatives of a
section of the bourgeoisie. Thus the French Popular Front was a
political alliance between the workers&rsquo; parties and the
Radicals, described by Trotsky as the &lsquo;democratic party of
French imperialism&rsquo;.  <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> ANL sponsors like Keith Waterhouse and
Glenda Jackson were not short of a bob or two, but no-one could
seriously describe them as the political representatives of a wing of
the British ruling class. Indeed, the majority of ANL sponsors were
probably trade unionists (with the NUJ, Equity and the Musicians&rsquo;
Union in a preponderance).</P>
<P>Nor was the ANL a united front in the classic sense. The Labour
MPs, like Neil Kinnock and Gwyneth Dunwoody (yes really! Remember?)
helped the ANL&rsquo;s credibility, but it was Joe Strummer and Elvis
Costello who pulled the crowds. It was in many ways a unique
historical experience, one which, in Widgery&rsquo;s words,
&lsquo;genuinely brought culture and politics into each other&rsquo;s
arms and set them dancing&rsquo;. (p.&nbsp;52)</P>
<P>But if Widgery&rsquo;s strength lies in his ability to recreate a
concrete historical situation, his weakness lies in the absence of an
adequate theoretical framework. Widgery stresses, quite rightly, the
dimension of spontaneity. Revolutionaries have to know when to &lsquo;learn
from the masses&rsquo;.  <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a> But as Lenin pointed out, the process is
a two-way one: &lsquo;Undoubtedly, the revolution will teach us, and
will teach the masses of the people. But the question that now
confronts a militant political party is: shall we be able to teach
the revolution anything?&rsquo;  <a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></P>
<P>In 1977 Paul Weller, in a classic punk affirmation, told the world
that &lsquo;the kids know where it&rsquo;s at&rsquo;.  <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a> (Weller was
not yet nineteen and in that Jubilee year believed that the Queen was
&lsquo;the best diplomat we&rsquo;ve got&rsquo;.  <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a>) The following
year a somewhat older Widgery echoed Weller in a letter to <B>Socialist
Review</B>.  <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a> &lsquo;... &quot;Youth&quot; ... have ten times more
idea of what&rsquo;s going down than your pretty average Marxist
Editor ... working class kids NOW are political and fun without
having to make 5 minute speeches to prove it.&rsquo;</P>
<P>Widgery does not quote this in <B>Beating Time</B> &ndash; but he
does not seem to have broken clearly with the conceptions that lie
behind it. For what is missing here is a concept of ideology. If the
kids do know &lsquo;where it&rsquo;s at&rsquo; by the simple device
of being biologically young and bopping to the right music, then
ideology poses no problems &ndash; we can simply step outside of it.
This is simply the other side of the coin of the Althusserian notion
that &lsquo;ideology ... is indispensable in any society&rsquo;.  <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a>
Both concepts encourage passivity and deny the need for politics. If
ideology can be cast aside without effort, or if it is totally
inescapable, then there is not much that should, and can, be done.</P>
<P>Marx and Engels had a more demanding formulation: &lsquo;The ideas
of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas&rsquo;.  <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a>
Ruling-class ideas will <I>dominate</I> (otherwise the system would
collapse), but they are not the only ideas; there is ground for
ideological struggle.</P>
<P>Widgery&rsquo;s underestimation of ideology becomes clear in his
assessment of culture. Writing of himself and the generation of 1968
he states:</p>

<p class="quoteb">When we were finding our way to Marxism in the 1960s our
common influences were not only Mayakovsky, El Lissitzky, Tallin,
Brecht, Grosz and Heartfield but surrealism, the cinema, Tamla
Motown, the <B>Village Voice</B>, Cadillac fins and American pop art.
(p.&nbsp;54)</p>

<p class="fst">Now personally, I&rsquo;m not very sure whether I would get
Cadillac fins at a garage or a fish shop. But Widgery undoubtedly
does have an important point here. The items he lists were part of
the sensibility of the left in the sixties, and any history that
leaves them out in favour of a unique focus on Wilson&rsquo;s
anti-union laws or why Workers&rsquo; Fight split from Militant will
quite simply miss the point.</P>
<P>Yet whenever Widgery starts producing his rather breathless lists
of cultural heroes and influences (which he does repeatedly
throughout the book) I am reminded of T.S. Eliot&rsquo;s famous
definition of &lsquo;culture&rsquo;: &lsquo;Culture ... includes all
the characteristic activities and interests of a people: Derby Day,
Henley Regatta, Cowes, the twelfth of August, a cup final, the dog
races, the pin table, the dart board, Wensleydale cheese, boiled
cabbage cut into sections, beetroot in vinegar, nineteenth-century
Gothic churches, and the music of Elgar.&rsquo;  <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></P>
<P>Like Eliot, Widgery underestimates the extent to which &lsquo;culture&rsquo;
is an embodiment and expression of ideology. This underestimation
undoubtedly springs from a generous impulse; Widgery wants to have
all the angels on his side. Unlike Leavis, he wants a &lsquo;great
tradition&rsquo; that is elastically all-inclusive. Unfortunately,
Widgery&rsquo;s reluctance to draw ideological lines leads to some
serious problems in both political and cultural analysis.</P>
<P>The period of the ANL was one of deep crisis for reformism in
Britain and around the world. In Portugal a working class which after
more than four decades of dictatorship, had not developed&rsquo; mass
reformist organisations, seemed, in 1975, to be moving towards
revolution. In Britain the Labour government&rsquo;s fraudulent
&lsquo;Social Contract&rsquo; had won the support of the trade union
bureaucracy, including the &lsquo;Lefts&rsquo; like Scanlon and
Jones, and thereby of the layer of established militants who looked
to the left bureaucrats. Apart from the defeated firefighters&rsquo;
strike of 1977&ndash;78 there were few national confrontations; what
did happen was a series of small but courageous and tenacious
struggles &ndash; Trico, Grunwicks, Garners &ndash; involving workers
&ndash; often black and/or female &ndash; who were relatively
untouched by reformist influences. The IS/SWP strategy in the period
was therefore to relate to the minority who wanted to fight. Hence
the Right to Work Campaign, the rather less successful by-election
candidacies and the street confrontations with the Nazis.</P>
<P>In such a situation it was all too easy to underestimate the
resilience of reformism, its ability to co-opt and recuperate the new
militants. In January 1977, Duncan Hallas (a comrade not unduly
swayed by the strains of punk rock) made the prediction (rash but not
yet falsified) that &lsquo;it may well be the case that Callaghan&rsquo;s
is the <I>last</I> majority Labour government&rsquo;.  <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a> And in
1978 Tony Cliff wrote an article called <I>Why Socialists must
support gays</I>, which warned the left not to believe that &lsquo;the
lieutenants of the revolution will all be forty-year-old white male
shop stewards&rsquo;, and declared that &lsquo;we should look forward
now to the first leader of the London workers&rsquo; council being a
19-year-old black gay woman!&rsquo;  <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a> The image of quadruple
oppression (by race, sex, sexuality and age) was a powerful one; but
eight years on Cliff&rsquo;s black Lesbian is probably a 27-year-old
Labour councillor somewhere in inner London. Mario Soares succeeded
in containing the Portuguese Revolution, and many of the
revolutionaries of the mid-seventies have been sucked into the Labour
Party to tail first Benn and then Kinnock.</P>
<P>Widgery accepts (p.&nbsp;8) that the ANL&rsquo;s victory was
temporary; what he fails to explain is how it happened that so much
that seemed possible in the late seventies failed to come about. Thus
Widgery notes that it was possible for the SWP and the Labour Party
to ally in the ANL, despite their divergent interests; he quotes Neil
Kinnock as saying: &lsquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned the ANL
performs a very important function for the Labour Party.&rsquo;
(p.&nbsp;113) Indeed it did; the Labour Party probably recruited
rather more members via the ANL than the SWP did. Kinnock might have
added that the ANL played a &lsquo;very important function&rsquo; for
Neil Kinnock MP. For Kinnock, like so many reformist leaders before
him, was elected by the left in order to lead from the right; his
past with the ANL was undoubtedly one of the factors that helped to
create his left image in 1983.</P>
<P>Because Widgery doesn&rsquo;t have a theory of ideology he is
unable to explain the mechanisms of that ideological recuperation by
reformism. Why did the kids cease to know &lsquo;where it was at&rsquo;?
Was it simply old age? And as a result Widgery simply fails to pose
the problem of how revolutionaries should operate in a movement like
the ANL.</P>
<P>Widgery does draw out the key role of the SWP &ndash; and notably
of Jim Nichol and Paul Holborow &ndash; in initiating the ANL
(pp.&nbsp;49&ndash;50). Without that SWP initiative the ANL would
simply not have happened &ndash; and the far right would have grown
much stronger. But because Widgery sees everything from the
standpoint of the mass movement, nothing from the standpoint of the
party, he ducks the real problems. This issue is not one of
manipulation (&rsquo;Sinister Trotskyists mislead bright-eyed
youth&rsquo;); would that it were so easy for a revolutionary group
of some 3,000 to &lsquo;manipulate&rsquo; demonstrations of up to a
hundred thousand. Widgery&rsquo;s cataloguing of the spontaneity and
local initiative which lay behind RAR and the ANL makes it easy to
answer such smears.</P>
<P>The more difficult question, which Widgery does not even raise, is
as follows: the ANL was a broad-front, single-issue campaign. As such
the vast majority of its members remained recuperable by reformism.
Yet such a campaign could only exist through the initiative of the
revolutionary minority. So how do the revolutionaries act to build a
successful broad front, but at the same time recruit to their own
organisation, the only effective way of constructing a barrier
against reformist influence?</P>
<P>Of course there is no easy answer to this dilemma. The
contradiction, as Tony Cliff often remarks, is in &lsquo;life
itself&rsquo;. In the 1966&ndash;68 period the International Marxist
Group took the initiative in launching the Vietnam Solidarity
Campaign. The International Socialists let the IMG carry the
administrative leadership of the VSC; we concentrated on building the
campaign on the ground &ndash; and on fighting for our own politics.
As a result we recruited far more members from the VSC than the IMG
did. At the time of the ANL that solution was not available; if we
had not launched the campaign no-one would have. To have abstained
would have been both criminal and suicidal. And it was no solution to
make some SWP members into ANL apparatchiks, others into SWP
propagandists &ndash; such a division of labour could only import
conflict into the party.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly, however, we did make some serious mistakes. All too
often we assumed that anyone who bought a Clash album was already a
revolutionary (rather than someone with whom it was very much
worthwhile arguing revolutionary politics). And <B>Socialist Worker</B>
&ndash; despite its lively and imaginative presentation, made some
serious concessions in terms of carrying socialist arguments. The
same kind of spontaneism that underlies Widgery&rsquo;s analysis made
it possible for <B>Socialist Worker</B> to fight shy of defending
Marxist theory. Thus one Garry Bushell (now with <B>The Sun</B>)
attacked</p>

<p class="quoteb">... fossilised theoreticians who want to write skins and
punks in on the page that says &lsquo;the proletarian youth flocked
to the party&rsquo;s leadership&rsquo;.</p>

<p class="quote">As for the other sanitised slide-rule socialists &ndash;
you can sit there with your logarithms writing theses on the perfect
revolution until they&rsquo;re ready to fumigate your cell at the
next Belsen.  <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a></p>

<p class="fst">The underestimation of ideology that makes Widgery unable to
confront these problems also mars his treatment of what is the main
focus of his book, the specific role of rock music &ndash; in
particular Rock Against Racism &ndash; in the anti-Nazi struggle. As
Widgery points out, there were teachers, miners, railway workers,
drunks and left-handed vegetarians Against the Nazis&rsquo;. The
ANL&rsquo;s sponsors included film-actors, university professors and
classical musicians. But it was the Rock Against Racism carnivals
which gave the ANL its biggest mobilisations and gave the campaign
its real mass penetration. Why?</P>
<P>There have been two conceptions of rock music current on the left.
The protagonists of the former claim that rock is in some sense
inherently revolutionary; they base their case on the roots of the
music in black oppression, on the selective quotation of allegedly
subversive lyrics, and on the equally selective quotation of
expressions of outrage by ageing clergymen and right-wing
politicians.</P>
<P>The proponents of the opposing case deny any specifically
progressive qualities to the music. They point to the conservative
and often sexist nature of many of the songs; to the competitive and
individualist nature of the star system; and above all to the way the
music becomes a commodity and a source of huge profits, something
totally integrated within the capitalist system.</P>
<P>Both accounts are true; both, taken in isolation, are patent
nonsense. What is needed is some way of understanding the
contradictions that riddle the history and practice of rock music.</P>
<P>We have to begin by recognising that as yet no historical
materialist theory of music exists. It may be hypothetically possible
to show that rhythms and musical structures are the expression of
ideologies, but as yet it has not been done. True Plato wanted to ban
&lsquo;relaxing modes&rsquo; and &lsquo;drinking songs&rsquo; from
his ideal authoritarian state  <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a>, and J.S. Bach argued that all
music&rsquo;s &lsquo;<I>finis</I> and final cause should never be
anything else but the glory of God and the recreation of the mind.
When this is not heeded, there really is no music, but a hellish howl
and clatter.&rsquo;  <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a> We may deduce that neither Plato nor Bach
would have much liked the Sex Pistols and that their dislike would
not have been a question of personal &lsquo;taste&rsquo; but
something to do with their (conservative) world-views. But this is no
more than a hint of the existence of a musical ideology; to identify
such a thing will require an immense labour in the study of complex
mediations and we may well not get it this side of the revolution. So
we shall have to make do with some more instrumental criteria.</P>
<P>Widgery stresses the black origins of the music. This was a
powerful agitational theme for denouncing white racist musicians who
ripped off black music and for exploiting the contradiction of white
racist youth who liked black music. And undoubtedly the blues and
jazz that Widgery looks back to was a profound expression of racial
and social oppression. But just as Widgery ignores the capacity of
reformism for ideological recuperation, so too he ignores the ability
of the music industry to co-opt and tame. Capitalism can certainly
live with Michael Jackson&rsquo;s <I>Thriller</I> (the
biggest-selling album ever) and Lionel Richie does not seem set to
bring the system crashing down.</P>
<P>So should we simply pack in contemporary music and concentrate on
rare blues records from the forties? Not, I would argue, while the
Redskins (with Tony Cliff on backing vocals) can make No.&nbsp;31 in
the album charts. For if the ruling ideas of the music industry are
deeply reactionary, there is still ground for ideological struggle.
Popular music &ndash; much more than the cinema, television or the
press &ndash; is still permeable and its permeability is rooted in
its structure.</P>
<P>Popular music is inherently committed to innovation; it markets by
constantly promising to replace the old by the new. This is embodied
in the institution of the weekly chart, and above all in the concept
of the &lsquo;climber&rsquo; on which radio and television chart
presentation is based. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how well a record is
selling; if it is doing less well than last week it is on the way
out.</P>
<P>In order to satisfy the thirst for innovation which it has itself
created, the industry needs a reserve army of new talent. Of course
the easiest way to do this is to manufacture the new band
synthetically (a task made much easier by computers, which make
musical ability largely obsolete). The only problem is that it
doesn&rsquo;t always work. Sigue Sigue Sputnik were launched as the
Sex Pistols of the mid-eighties, complete with &lsquo;designer
violence&rsquo;, racist jokes and a half-sympathetic plug in <B>New
Socialist</B>.  <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> Unfortunately nobody much wanted to buy the
records. With luck someone lost a lot of money on the exercise.</P>
<P>So the industry still has to rely for its reserve army on those
weird unknown bands you hear on the John Peel programme. And those
bands &ndash; because some of them are young, poor and actually enjoy
music &ndash; are just sometimes radical, not only musically but
politically. Of course Peel may disappear when Radio One is
privatised, but the contradiction remains. The music industry has
colossal powers of recuperation, but it can never quite close the
gap.</P>
<P>As a result ruling class hegemony over popular music is less than
total. Despite money, despite hyping, it cannot be wholly relied
upon. The really interesting thing about popular music during the
Falklands War is not that Elvis Costello wrote an excellent (but not
terribly successful) song opposing it but that there were <I>no</I>
pro-war records. Presumably few bands supported the war and those
that did were not going to stick their necks out and risk their
reputation. Those of us old enough to remember being assailed by Anne
Shelton&rsquo;s <I>Lay Down Your Arms</I> (despite its title a
pro-militarist song) in the run up to Suez (let alone Petula Clark
being promoted as &lsquo;forces&rsquo; favourite&rsquo; in the Korean
War) were both surprised and thankful.</P>
<P>On this account Widgery is right to stress the political potential
of rock music; but wrong to underestimate the industry&rsquo;s powers
of ideological recuperation. This leads him to overstate the
achievements of the RAR period, and to distort what has happened
since.</P>
<P>Thus Widgery argues that by 1977 &lsquo;punk was clearly a mass
movement&rsquo;. Indeed, by the standards of small revolutionary
groups; but in terms of the popular music market it remained a
minority current. Apart from the Sex Pistols&rsquo; seven top ten
entries there were few major punk hits. The Clash never made the top
ten at all, and performers like Aswad and Carol Grimes, who feature
prominently in Widgery&rsquo;s account, never made the chart at all.
During the year of the two carnivals, 1978, the Number One position
was occupied for sixteen weeks by John Travolta and Olivia
Newton-John, and for another nine by the black but banal Boney M. The
only chart-toppers remotely akin to RAR interests were Althea and
Donna&rsquo;s <I>Up Town Top Ranking</I> and the Boomtown Rats&rsquo;
<I>Rat Trap</I>.  <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></P>
<P>More seriously, Widgery fails to explain &ndash; or apparently to
understand &ndash; what has happened since the golden days of RAR. In
the early eighties the Jam and the Specials did take overtly
political songs all the way to Number One, but since then the picture
has indeed been bleak. Widgery&rsquo;s optimism is thus surprising:</p>

<p class="quoteb">The potent idea that pop music can be about something
more than mere entertainment has remained and deepened. Live Aid
above all but even Wham! miming for the miners, Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s
hefty donation to the Women Against Pit Closures campaign, and the
joint version of <I>You&rsquo;ll Never Walk Alone</I> to raise money
for the victims of the Bradford football stadium fire in June 1985,
all represent a wider recognition of the social power popular music
can have which goes back to RAR and the early days of punk. The music
is often tinsel-weight but the projects represent a huge advance on
the take-the-money-and-run mentality. (p.&nbsp;116)</p>

<p class="fst">Here Widgery&rsquo;s desire to have all the angels on his side
seems to have taken him right out of reality. The reference to
&lsquo;mentality&rsquo; seems to place the whole thing on the level
of personal morality, ignoring the pressures of material interest and
ideology. Did Widgery not notice that while the Live Aid and Bradford
fire records were cheerfully hyped to Number One, the <I>only</I>
pro-miner record that made any impact on the charts was the Council
Collective&rsquo;s <I>Soul Deep</I>; and that became a quite minor
hit only after the performers had been panicked into donating some of
the proceeds to a scab taxi-driver&rsquo;s widow? As for Live Aid,
its role for 1980s rock stars is what &lsquo;buying my mum and dad a
big house&rsquo; was for their predecessors in the fifties &ndash;
confirmation that they are nice boys and girls at heart.</P>
<P>On the contrary, what has happened in the mid-eighties is that in
a period with no social movements to exercise a pull in the opposite
direction, the profit-makers have tightened their grip and succeeded
in making virtually everything they touch anodyne, diluted music for
a demoralised public. The industry has even solved the old problem of
what to do with those who are too old to rock and roll but too young
to die &ndash; it sells them Bruce Springsteen and Dire Straits.</P>
<P>What is needed in this situation is not a vague &lsquo;mentality&rsquo;
of good-will, but hard politics. And that politics has to be backed
up by organisation. But just as Widgery underplayed the role of the
revolutionary party in fighting reformism, so he fails to point to
the role of the party in cultural struggle. One of the very few bands
that has preserved its political and musical integrity over the
recent period is the Redskins. Firstly, because membership of the SWP
has given them a clear political framework. And secondly, because
every time they appear on stage or television, they know they are
being watched by SWP members muttering: &lsquo;Beware of your
deviations and <I>faux-pas</I>, we shall not miss a single one.&rsquo;
 <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></P>
<P>Of course other musicians have fought against the pressure, and
felt the need of party organisation. Since the SWP could not offer it
to them in the present period, they turned to the Labour Party. Hence
Red Wedge was formed. Now Widgery&rsquo;s book was completed last
December, and he makes no mention of Red Wedge; but its existence
puts his methodology to the test. Widgery&rsquo;s failure is that he
doesn&rsquo;t draw the ideological lines &ndash; between politics and
charity between Live Aid and the miners&rsquo; strike. It is only
when we have drawn the lines that we can deal with those troublesome
cases that straddle across them.</P>
<P>For Red Wedge are centrists, vacillating elements with one foot in
the camp of class struggle and the other in Kinnock&rsquo;s election
machine. And as with all centrists, our job is to pursue, not woolly
compromise, but political clarification and polarisation. Our aim,
pursued firmly but fraternally, is to draw the dividing line between
the reformists and the revolutionaries among them, and above all
among their followers.</P>
<P>To do so would be a small but worthwhile task, a task which would
require the party to take cultural intervention seriously. In the
period after the demise of the ANL and RAR, there was a tendency to
&lsquo;bend the stick&rsquo; away from what were perceived as the
excesses of the period. Between 1982 and 1984 there was a virtual
embargo on the discussion of popular music in the pages of <B>Socialist
Worker</B>. Happily this state of affairs is now over, thanks largely
to the efforts of the Redskins, who kept on keeping on when they were
getting little support or encouragement from the party machine. The
time is now ripe to make a sober assessment of the achievements and
limitations of one of the most important phases in the party&rsquo;s
history. Widgery&rsquo;s book is a valuable starting-point in that
task.</P>

<p class="note"><a href="#f2" name="n2">2.</a> Indeed, it is a little too unscholarly; like Widgery&rsquo;s
earlier <B>The Left in Britain</B> (Harmondsworth 1986) the work is
marred by minor errors: thus Ken Worpole becomes Ken Walpole, the
Leyton Buzzards become the Leighton Buzzards, <I>Anarchy in the UK</I>,
which peaked at No.&nbsp;38, is said to have topped the charts, and
the chronology contains some wild inaccuracies.</P>

<p class="note"><a href="#f20" name="n20">20.</a> All statistics come from the standard source book, <B>The
Guinness Book of British Hit Singles</B> (Enfield 1983). I am, of
course, aware that the charts are rigged and hyped, but I am using
them as a very crude indicator &ndash; i.e. a top ten record gets
bought and heard quite a lot. Chart placings are more easily
accessible than sales figures, which may also be rigged and distorted
by lying and home-taping. The chart was a <em>Top Fifty</em> until 29 April
1978, and a <em>Top Seventy-Five</em> thereafter. Unfortunately on these
charts the Sex Pistols&rsquo; <I>God Save the Queen</I> never got
higher than Number Two.</P>
