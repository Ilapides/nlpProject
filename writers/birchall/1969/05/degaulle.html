<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Worker</strong>, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/sw-gb/1969/index.html#n0120" target="new">No. 120</a>, 1 May 1969, p.&nbsp;5.<br />

<p class="fst">THE DEPARTURE of de&nbsp;Gaulle has come as a surprise to those who have been so bemused by his personality that they have ignored the real social forces in France.</p>

<p>In fact it shows that the movement begun last May is still very much alive. In the elections last June the alliance of de&nbsp;Gaulle&rsquo;s blackmail and the Communist Party&rsquo;s conservatism was able to produce a temporary swing to the right.</p>

<p>But while the student movement has gone into something of a decline, the working class has continued the fight. Other sections of the population, like peasants and small shopkeepers, who are very numerous in France, are becoming increasingly militant.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Reflects</h4>

<p class="fst">Last May showed that it is possible to win these classes for a revolutionary line, if the workers take the lead.</p>

<p>At the same time, de&nbsp;Gaulle&rsquo;s departure reflects the problems of French capitalism.</p>

<p>De&nbsp;Gaulle was brought in by big capital to end the Algerian war, which was a nuisance to it. He straightened up the constitution and helped integrate the unions.</p>

<p><em>But now big capital wants someone who will not have de&nbsp;Gaulle&rsquo;s nationalist attitudes and who will help get France back in the US orbit.</em></p>

<p><em>Pompidou &ndash; of the Rothschild bank &ndash; is their man, though he may well be defeated if a centre candidate can group all the opposition parties, leaving the CP out in the cold.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Battle</h4>

<p class="fst">But while the presidential manoeuvres go on, the real battle to build a new party to the left of the CP continues. The recent turn to a semi-revolutionary line by the formerly Parliamentary PSU and the slow moves towards unity among the left groupings, suggest that in the not too distant future such a party may play a significant role in French politics.</p>
