<p class="fst"><strong>A broadcast by the ANC&#8217;s <em>Radio Freedom</em> has called on
workers to &#8220;intensify their strike actions by sabotaging machinery,
destroying documents, and making sure that commodities coming off
assembly lines are useless ...&#8221; (quoted in <em>Anti-Apartheid News</em>,
September 1985)</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;By so doing we will force the capitalists to realise that
ours is a country at war, and that their profits are in danger,&#8221;
the broadcast said.</strong></p>
<p><strong>NIMROD SEJAKE, a founder member of SACTU, secretary of the
Transvaal Iron and Steel Workers&#8217; Union and an ANC Treason Trialist
in the 1950s, explains why this call by the ANC leadership is wrong
and cannot advance the liberation struggle of the working people.</strong></p>
<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />

<p class="fst">It is dangerous to the revolution, self-defeating and an act of
desperation for the ANC leadership in exile to exhort the working
class in South Africa to &#8220;sabotage industry&#8221;. Destruction of
machinery is not the working-class method of combat against the
capitalists who exploit them.</p>
<p>Sabotaging machinery was a method of resistance attempted by
workers against their employers in Europe <em>when the workers&#8217;
movement was in its infancy and workers lacked a sense of their
collective power to take strike action</em>. Machine-breaking (e.g. by
the &#8216;Luddites&#8217; in England) died out well over a century ago
because it was ineffective.</p>
<p>Engels explained that such actions were inevitably isolated and,
&#8220;When the momentary end was attained, the whole weight of social
power fell upon the unprotected evil-doers and punished them to its
heart&#8217;s content ...&#8221; (<strong>Collected Works</strong>, vol.&nbsp;4, p.&nbsp;503)</p>
<p>In <strong>Capital</strong> (vol.&nbsp;I, ch.&nbsp;XIII) Marx wrote: &#8220;Time
and experience were needed before the workers could ... come to
direct their attacks, not against the material instruments of
production (machines), but against the particular social form in
which these instruments are used&#8221; &#8211; namely capitalist
exploitation itself.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Strike action</h4>
<p class="fst">The classic method of <em>such</em> a struggle, developed by the
working class, is to combine in large numbers and use their power as
the producers of wealth to halt production <em>through strike action</em>.</p>
<p>When workers doing forced labour under <em>fascist</em> regimes in
the past have smashed machinery, this was in a situation where their
organisations had been destroyed and they could not take collective
action. Does anyone still think that is the situation in South Africa
&#8211; after more than a decade of successfully rebuilding strong
democratic organisations in the factories and townships, and after
the launch of COSATU uniting half a million workers?</p>
<p>Does &#8220;sabotaging machinery&#8221; or &#8220;making sure that commodities
coming off assembly lines are useless&#8221; in any way add to or
&#8220;intensify&#8221; <em>strike action</em>, as the ANC broadcast claimed?
The answer is no.</p>
<p>The very moment that strike action is effectively mounted there is
an absolute cessation of production. Absolutely nothing is produced
through the assembly lines at that point in time and for so long as
the condition lasts. How can &#8220;commodities&#8221; be &#8220;coming off
assembly lines&#8221; when labour is at a standstill?</p>
<p>Sabotaging machinery, rendering commodities &#8220;useless&#8221; etc.,
would be a sign of the <em>weakness</em> or ineffectiveness of strike
action &#8211; of the inability of workers in that place or at that time
to unite and use their collective power. Far from &#8220;intensifying&#8221;
strike action, sabotage is the method of individuals or isolated
groups who divert attention away from the real task &#8211; which is to
organise and mobilise the working class to use its full social power
in mass actions.</p>
<p>Once that mass power is asserted, once labour is withheld by the
workers as in the case of strike action, sabotage of factories only
introduces confusion and division into the ranks of the workers
because it <em>adds nothing</em> to the strength of the action while
<em>threatening the very existence of the workers&#8217; jobs</em>.</p>
<p>If machines are damaged, obviously the employers would be given
the excuse of simply calling in the police to arrest the workers
nearest to the broken machinery. The workers involved would easily be
replaced and production soon continued.</p>
<p>The aim of sabotaging machinery, according to the broadcast, would
be to &#8220;force the capitalists to realise ... that their profits are
in danger.&#8221; Effective strike action forces the capitalists to
realise precisely that. Mass action is what terrifies them. Why
should industrial sabotage, which has historically proved
ineffective, achieve more than that?</p>
<p>Besides, the point is not to frighten the capitalists but to
prepare the working class to take power and end both apartheid and
capitalism. Sabotage of machinery etc. does not advance but obstructs
that struggle.</p>
<p>The capitalists are rich and own factories because they exploit
the working class. They pay the workers less than the value which the
workers&#8217; labour produces. Their profits are the <em>unpaid labour of
the working class</em>.</p>
<p>When they accumulate capital, investing profits in factories and
machinery, they are accumulating value stolen from the working class.</p>
<p>This they use to sustain their power and exploit the workers
further. The workers&#8217; task is to organise to take power and seize
the means of production.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, over the years, the ANC leadership has failed to
understand the enormous power of the working class and its tasks in
the struggle for national and social liberation in South Africa.</p>
<p>Hence the leadership, backed up by the so-called &#8216;Communist&#8217;
Party, clings with amazing bulldog tenacity to the erroneous
two-stage theory of struggle. They believe it will be possible to
&#8220;achieve national liberation first&#8221; while postponing a workers&#8217;
revolution and socialism to some unknown future period.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>State power</h4>
<p class="fst">That is a wrong approach to revolution flowing from ignorance of
the science of Marxism. The nature of our struggle in South Africa is
unequivocally a class struggle &#8211; a struggle that must be led by the
working class for the <em>conquest of state power</em>, the elimination
of apartheid, the achievement of democracy and national liberation by
the black majority, and the overthrow of capitalism.</p>
<p>National liberation will only be won by using the method of <em>class struggle</em>.</p>
<p>Since the dissolution of the primeval communistic (early tribal)
society, &#8220;the history of all hitherto existing society is the
history of class struggle&#8221;. (Marx)</p>
<p>If one advocates the destruction of machinery, that can only
amount to a senseless act of vandalism. It is a blow against the
working class itself, devastating their property, namely, the means
of production: factory plants, machines, etc., which are absolutely
necessary for the production of the means of consumption to sustain
the people &#8211; without which any &#8220;liberation&#8221; would be meaningless.</p>
<p>They are the very foundation on which a healthy, well-planned
socialist economy must be constructed.</p>
<p>The means of production are the workers&#8217; inalienable legitimate
property, which they and they alone have created and must retrieve
intact. They have been stolen by the capitalist ruling class through
exploiting workers. The need therefore arises for a socialist
revolution spearheaded by the working class, in the period ahead to
recover their property.</p>
<p>The speech delivered on the occasion of the launching of COSATU by
its first President, comrade Elijah Barayi, that &#8220;COSATU will
nationalise the mines and even take over some of the big businesses,&#8221;
has a mighty echo in the ranks of the revolutionary working class of
the world, who are flexing their muscles to retrieve their stolen
property.</p>
<p>Comrade Barayi&#8217;s speech is a barometer indicating the unfolding
events of the new era of socialist ideas.</p>
<p>The launching of COSATU is the crossing of the Rubicon. The way
forward now is through a clear direction of Marxism, the building of
direct links on an ever increasing international scale to overthrow
world capitalism and all the evils of apartheid starting with the
immoral pass laws.</p>
<p class="c"><strong>Forward to Socialism!</strong></p>
