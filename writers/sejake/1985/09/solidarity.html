<br />
<p class="fst">Over the past five years many Labour Party and trade union
branches have shown appreciation of the work of the Southern African
Labour Education Project (SALEP).</p>
<p>SALEP produces vitally needed socialist education materials for
the workers and youth movement in South Africa. It also helps to
build links between the growing trade union and youth movement in
South Africa and other workers throughout the world.</p>
<p>But on 27 March this year, Labour&#8217;s National Executive Committee
(NEC) resolved to direct that &#8220;Regions, CLPs and affiliates have no
contacts with SALEP, do not use its materials or allow it
facilities&#8221;. In effect a ban has been introduced.</p>
<p>The NEC said SALEP were outside &#8220;mainstream progressive opinion
both within and outside South Africa&#8221;, for among other things
linking the end of apartheid with the end of capitalism and for
building links between workers in South Africa and elsewhere.</p>
<p>During the British miners&#8217; strike, striking Staffordshire miner
Roy Jones was invited by the South African NUM to visit South African
miners. The black mineworkers gave a generous donation to the British
miners&#8217; strike and Roy met SA NUM leaders, conference delegates,
stewards and rank and file.</p>
<p>The NEC report claimed that SALEP were not building links at all
levels and that Roy was a &#8220;white unrepresentative member&#8221; of the
British NUM. The South African NUM on the other hand made him their
first white member.</p>
<p>The NEC also claim that SALEP&#8217;s expenditure is diverting
resources from the liberation movement. The claim is nonsense.</p>
<p>The African National Congress (ANC) receives big grants from a
number of governments including a million kroner a year from the
Swedish government, dwarfing SALEP&#8217;s Â£5,000 a year spending.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>New federation</h4>
<p class="fst">The NEC report echoes the view put forward in the Stalinist SA
Communist Party through the ANC and South African Congress of Trade
Unions (SACTU) in exile.</p>
<p>Instead of taking organisational action against SALEP on the
advice of a body dominated by the SA Communist Party, the Labour
Party should look to the new federation of independent trade unions
being formed this November, which, drawing together up to half a
million black workers, will constitute the most powerful organisation
of black workers in South Africa&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>The unions making up this &#8216;super union&#8217; all advocate direct
links between workers internationally and particularly between
organised workers in the same multinationals.</p>
<p>How can the NEC now justify its statement that &#8220;it is the duty
of the international trade union movement to consult and accept the
advice of SACTU&#8221; when the organised black workers have their own
directly elected representatives?</p>
<p>SALEP makes no apology for advocating direct links and direct
support for the non-racial trade unions in their struggle against
oppression and the capitalist monopolies. At the same time it
supports the ANC and the United Democratic Front (UDF) whose leaders
are on trial for treason.</p>
<p>Both these organisations endorse the Freedom Charter which calls
for the nationalisation of the monopolies and banks. While the
leadership of the ANC fudges this question and talks of &#8216;breaking
the monopolies&#8217;, SALEP supports the full implementation of the
ANC&#8217;s freedom charter as do the hundreds of thousands of activists
in the country.</p>
<p>As a group carrying out socialist education, SALEP is helping to
prepare black workers for the task of leading their unions, community
organisations and the UDF on a programme of national liberation and
socialism. As a FOSATU speaker said at a May Day rally this year:
&#8220;Capitalism is our enemy!&#8221; (<strong>Star</strong>, 2 May 1985).</p>
<p>It is these ideas of the mass movement, strengthened and explained
in SALEPs material, which the NEC has condemned in banning SALEP and
the campaigns for direct links.</p>
<p>Delegates should read the letter of protest from left-wing members
of the NEC available from SALEP and oppose the right wings
suppression of socialist education.</p>
<p>Speakers from SALEP should be invited to the GMC, regional
parties, wards and trade unions to hear their reply and report on the
exciting developments in the Labour movement in South Africa, which
dooms apartheid and capitalism to destruction.</p>
