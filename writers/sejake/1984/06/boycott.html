<p class="fst">Dear comrade,</p>
<p class="fst">The Dunnes Stores empire in Ireland is recognised as having
anti-worker and anti-union bosses. On July 19, a worker in the Henry
Street store in Dublin was indefinitely suspended for refusing to
handle South African goods.</p>
<p>The majority of union members &#8211; a total of 11 &#8211; then began an
official strike. It is the policy of their union, the Irish
Distributive and Administrative trade union, to boycott South African goods.</p>
<p>The strikers are young workers and 10 of them are women.</p>
<p>So far they have been intimidated and harassed by scabs and on at
least two occasions vans have been driven at them. Indeed management
have resorted to bringing in food in trucks used for dumping rubbish!</p>
<p>Public support is very good and business is down 56%. Over IRÂ£80
(R128.00) a day is collected in buckets at the entrances.</p>
<p>The workers are aware of the conditions faced by their class
brothers and sisters in South Africa. They are absolutely determined
that their bosses will be taught not to stock South African goods.</p>
<p>A number of fellow union members in other stores are refusing to
handle the goods and the bosses are afraid to do anything.</p>
<p>The strikers hope that workers in South Africa will learn of their struggle.</p>
<p>They are determined to show their solidarity in the face of their
own vicious bosses.</p>
<p>Messages of support can be sent to: Karen Gearon (shop-steward),
c/o I.D.A.T.U., 9, Cavendish Row, Dublin 1, Ireland.</p>
