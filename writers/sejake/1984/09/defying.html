<p class="info">From <strong>Militant</strong>, No.&nbsp;717, 21 September 1984, p.&nbsp;11.<br/>
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>IN <em>MILITANT</em>, 14 September, a leading member of the
steelworkers union in South Africa in the &#8217;50s, <a href="power.html" target="new">described</a> how
workers who were denied by law the right to trade unions organised at
the African Lamps factory.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here he takes up the story after he had been arrested for
&#8220;trespass&#8221; while negotiating with management. The workers had
downed tools on his arrest.</strong></p>
<hr class="section" size="1" noshade="noshade" />
<p class="fst">When it became clear that the workers were not going to end their
strike, the police decided they could not take any action against me.
My arrest was dropped even though I was breaking the Bantu Labour
Settlement of Disputes Act 1953.</p>
<p>The next week, the workers met and we discussed strategy and
tactics for the new offensive. We then received an indictment. I was
accused number one. But we found out a very funny thing; every time
we went to court, the factory stopped because everyone was in the union.</p>
<p>The <strong>Rand Daily Mail</strong> which covered our court case said that
the iron and steel workers were the first African union to break the
1953 Act, so we felt our tactics were right were convicted
nonetheless and fined &#0163;3 each. We had decided the day before to go
to jail rather than pay the fine. We would say we had no money,
because we knew we would have no scabs in our workplace so the
factory could not work.</p>
<p>The employer was forced, not by the law, but by the conditions we
had created to pay our fines himself! We knew he couldn&#8217;t raise the
same number of workers with the same skill and expertise overnight.</p>
<p>But the employer thought it was all right to deduct a certain
amount from our pay packet every week until the &#0163;3 was paid back to
him. He did that but we appealed to the Supreme Court in Pretoria,
which found against the employer who had to refund every worker their
&#0163;3! What is more, wages went up, only by a penny an hour but by the
standard of wages for black workers in South Africa then it was
something to be proud of.</p>
<p>We had beaten the bosses in their own court, the Supreme Court,
after conviction in the magistrates court. But more importantly we
had won with our own weapon, the strike.</p>
<p>We learnt that when workers were properly organised, they were
strong; they could beat the bosses at the factory, they could get an
official out of the clutches of the police so the law was not all
powerful.</p>
