<p class="fst">Nimrod Sejake is something of a living legend. At 79 years-old,
the former leader of the metal workers&#8217; union in South Africa, is
still fighting for socialism as an active member of the CWI&#8217;s South
African section, Socialist Alternative. I met Nimrod at his small
house in White City, Soweto. The same house that the police raided
early one morning in December 1956, to arrest Nimrod for &#8220;high
treason&#8221;. He was placed in a cell with a young lawyer by the name
of Nelson Mandela!</p>
<p>&#8220;155 others were arrested that day&#8221; he explained, &#8220;Nelson
was the only one I knew, &#8216;Nimrod, are you here too?&#8217; he said when
they brought me in.&#8221; &#8220;Even before this time I was active in the
trade union movement. I was a founder member of SACTU (South African
Congress of Trade Unions) in 1955. I organised the workers into the
union, that was my job. The employers asked me &#8216;who is a member of
your committee?&#8217;, I said the whole factory are members, at that
time we called our union the Non-European Iron and Steel workers&#8217;
union.&#8221; Trade union organisation has never been a picnic, but
Nimrod&#8217;s comrades faced severe problems for which special methods
and tactics had to be improvised. &#8220;I had my differences with the
ANC leadership, for not following the class struggle. They criticised
me because I advocated breaking the law, which even stated that
&#8216;black workers have no right to strike&#8217;. The ANC leadership
didn&#8217;t back me up, they said: &#8216;Nimrod, you must negotiate&#8217;,
they didn&#8217;t approve of the fact that there were strikes every week
in the Iron and Steel sector &#8211; that was my sector.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trade unions played a decisive role in the struggle against
apartheid, especially the formation of Cosatu in the 1980s. Today
this is an incontestable fact. But South African marxists, like
Nimrod, argued this many years ago while the ANC leadership placed
their faith in a completely different strategy &#8211; a combination of
guerilla warfare organised from camps outside the country, and
international diplomacy.</p>
<p>Nimrod was forced to go into exile in 1962. I first met him in
Liverpool, England in the 1980s when he made a visit during the
famous struggle against the Thatcher government. He spent many years
as a refugee in Ireland.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been battling all my adult life&#8221;, he told me, &#8220;When
I came back to South Africa in 1992 I found that many comrades I knew
had left the country or died. The ANC branches had collapsed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Up until the early 1990s the CWI in South Africa supported the ANC
and was known as the Marxist Workers&#8217; Tendency of the ANC. But the
sharp rightward shift of the ANC in the 1990s led them to a total
break and to raise the call for a new workers&#8217; party.</p>
<p>Nimrod is active in his local community Everton, in Soweto,
fighting for the restoration of land which was illegally sold by the
apartheid regime. He launched the Everton Forum for Reconstruction
and Socialism, whose office also serves as a centre for the comrades
of Socialist Alternative.</p>
<p>So, after over six years of ANC government, what does he think of
the way things have turned out?</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sell out. A straightforward sell out!&#8221;, he says
angrily, &#8220;The ANC&#8217;s Freedom Charter states explicitly that all
the mineral wealth beneath the earth belongs to the people-Nelson did
away with it! It&#8217;s been undemocratically thrown into the dustbin
and replaced with naked capitalism, the so called GEAR programme,
privatisation etc. That&#8217;s a sell out! We didn&#8217;t fight all those
years to retain apartheid.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are people whose life has involved far fewer sacrifices, for
whom the betrayals experienced by Nimrod and his comrades would have
produced cynicism. But not him! After a lifetime of struggle he and
his wife live on a pension of 750 kronor a month. He still speaks
enthusiastically of battles to come: &#8220;All we have to do is see to
it that we organise the workers &#8211; internationally &#8211; to see to it
that we bring about a socialist alternative. There&#8217;s more and more
talk about the need to create a workers&#8217; party &#8211; that&#8217;s what&#8217;s
going on!&#8221;</p>
<p>Within days of talking to Nimrod, major class battles erupted in
the country. Cosatu&#8217;s leaders launched a programme of rolling
strikes, threatening a general strike on 10th May. The alliance
between Cosatu and the ANC &#8211; they sit together in the government &#8211;
is under the most severe strains ever. President Mbeki, under orders
from the stock exchange and international speculators, is attempting
to impose wage restraint, attack employment rights and central
bargaining. Last year saw more strikes than at any time since the ANC
took power in 1994. This year could see a further increase.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing has always been in my mind,&#8221; Nimrod had told me,
&#8220;we will never become free without the class struggle. I&#8217;ve
fought for fifty years with this idea in mind. The ideas of Karl
Marx, our ideas, have stood the test of history. Now it&#8217;s time for
a new generation of youth to take up the struggle.&#8221;</p>
