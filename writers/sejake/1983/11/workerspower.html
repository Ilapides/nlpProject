<p class="fst">It was from my organising work on the Reef that I came to see the
enormous power of the working class. During those days African trade
unions were not recognised and strikes by African workers were
illegal. But this was no barrier to the workers, if they were
properly organised.</p>
<p>Our motto in the Iron and Steel Union was that we should never go
to an employer with our demands unless we know our power, and that
power was to be found only when the workers were fully organised with
an understanding of how to go about a strike.</p>
<p>Then they can beat the employers in their own field. Even though
there are laws which are barriers, the workers break them, and with
intent. Even if the police are called in they cannot put into effect
their powers because the workers can make their powers ineffective.</p>
<p>Through our union experience we understood that only when you face
the employers from a position of strength can you change society in
South Africa. And if this was done all over the country, with clear
sense of direction, no power can impede the forward march of the
working class.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>White workers</h4>
<p class="fst">There is an important thing that we learned in the Iron and Steel
Union. We said to the black workers when they went on strike to talk
with white workers and tell them why we are striking. They should
explain that we are underpaid, discriminated against as a nation and
oppressed as a class. He laws dehumanise us, and make us mere
chattels of society.</p>
<p>Look, we would say to the white workers, you have the law on your
side, you have people you elect to of to the parliament to legislate,
and they legislate against us. You do skilled work, but according to
the law we are not allowed to do it.</p>
<p>Our struggle is not only about wages, but it is a political
question. We want to destroy the laws in this country, to make it fit
for workers of all races. And we are showing today that we can stop
this factory. We said this, for example, in the strikes at African
lamps and at Phoenix Foundry.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you can see,&#8221; the African workers said to the white
workers, &#8220;we stopped management from doing anything. We are the
bosses today. You can see you are being told to go home and not work
precisely because of our power. We can make you redundant&#8221; &#8211; this
is the word the workers used.</p>
<p>We were aware that the racist regime gets a great deal of support
from white workers. But we wanted to break down this granite wall. We
were saying to the white workers, look, we want to show you we can
penetrate the barriers put before us, we can pull them down and make
the laws ineffective.</p>
<p>As a result, during these strikes, some white workers began to
say: &#8220;Look, if you succeed, we are going to succeed as well&#8221;.
Many of them voiced the correct view that there is really no
difference between black labour and white labour; we should all be
striking for workers&#8217; rights. White workers say this behind closed
doors because they know the repercussions.</p>
<p>As far as my experiences show, the social support the regime is
enjoying from the white workers can be broken if the African workers
are strongly organised along the correct lines.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>ISCOR</h4>
<p class="fst">Often what the state and the employers think is impossible is made
possible by the working class! Let me give the example of huge
concerns like ISCOR. It was said in the 1950s to be impossible to
enter ISCOR, because it was always guarded. These large state
concerns are guarded precisely because if the workers could get a
grip on the, and stop production, the capitalists would be greatly affected.</p>
<p>But that impossibility as again proved by the workers to be a
paper tiger. Through the workers I entered ISCOR in Van der Bijl
Park. I organised the workers there first, not by going to the
factory, but by going to their homes. Through tem the other worker
could be brought into the movement.</p>
<p>Another strategy was making feasts or tea parties in the locations
&#8211; where we would meet and discuss. Through that I organised to go
in and distribute leaflets. It is such a huge concern that you would
not know which side of it you entered and which side you came out,
unless you were lead by the people working there.</p>
<p>So I took leaflets in a suitcase from Jo&#8217;burg. At the bus stop a
worker was there to guide me. Inside the plant the workers showed me
there we could unpack the bundles of leaflets. Before I knew it,
other workers were placing them in vantage points for workers coming
in on the next shift to find them. Then, when they knew the bus was
about to leave, they led me out to it and I left the place.</p>
<p>Here again the mighty power of the working class demonstrates
itself. Not only is it a power as far as stopping work is concerned,
but because the understanding, the creativity, the grasp of strategy
and tactics of the workers is so powerful, one they are properly
organised there is noting to fear in South Africa. In fact anywhere
in the world that the workers are properly organised with an
understanding of their tasks, they have nothing to fear.</p>
<p>So all these and many other experiences convince me that through
the power of the working class it is possible to bring SA to a
standstill, and overthrow that powerful regime. What we have to do
first is to organise the workers. Then we shall be facing battle from
a position of power, where we can tell the employers there are two
things existing here &#8211; you own the means of production, but we own
the labour-power, and if you don&#8217;t agree, we fold our hands and
your industry will be paralysed.</p>
<p>I came to see that the power of the working class was so enormous
that even if you compared it with the police, the army, the air
force, the prisons and magistrates court and judges, etc. &#8211; that
all the power cannot stand in the way of the struggle of the working
class to overthrow the state. The power lies in the working class, if
it is organised and given a direction, and that direction can only be
found in Marxism.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Marxism</h4>
<p class="fst">Marxism is a scientific theory, based on the experience of the
working class. That is why fro the workers Marxism s easily accepted,
because their lives prove it &#8211; their hard lives, cruel oppression,
brutal handling in the factory, in the locations, at home &#8211; with
low wages, high rents and high prices.</p>
<p>From this angle the worker understand theory. And when revolution
comes they grasp in a day what would otherwise take years to grasp.
In the Iron and Steel Union we used to say that the very thing that
is called law in South Africa is illegal, that there is no &#8216;law&#8217;
as far as Africans were concerned, because the majority of the people
take no part in making it, but it is made by the capitalists to
oppress the workers.</p>
<p>The only answer to that is for the workers to organise to take
political power into their own hands with the specific aim of ending
capitalism and achieving socialism. That is what Inqaba is saying:
the workers must build the trade unions and transform the ANC. I
support this view to the hilt.</p>
<p>Because, in the 1950s I already found, unfortunately, that this
was not the position taken by the leadership of SACTU, or of the
ANC, or of the South African Communist Party. They did not have
confidence in the power of the working class.</p>
<p>As an example, I will mention a time when I had organised nine
metal factories along the Rand, with the aim that when the workers
came out on strike, they would all come out simultaneously. When they
were all organised and ready I went to the SACTU leadership to make
sure of their support for the action. There would be a lightening
strike spreading along the Rand &#8211; and factories where the workers
had experience of strike action like Africa Lamps, Phoenix Foundry
and Benoni Foundry were ready tom come out in support.</p>
<p>In Iron and Steel we saw this as a great step forward for the
trade union movement. But the SACTU leaders told me (and I am quoting
them): &#8220;Nimrod, that is too much!&#8221;</p>
<p>Or again, there was the time in 1958 when the ANC called off a
tremendous three-day strike on the first day! Called it off! I
remember buying a newspaper and seeing the headline: &#8220;Secretary
General of the ANC, Oliver Tambo, calls off strike.&#8221; I was furious.
Because, at that time, we were on bail from the treason Trial, and
one of the conditions was that we did not attend meetings or organise
in any way. But, nevertheless, we had risked organising the workers
to make the strike a success.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Crisis of Leadership</h4>
<p class="fst">The leadership of the movement was lagging far behind, out of
touch with developments. That is why I support Inqaba because the
present situation requires a journal like this which puts forward
clearly the manner in which the struggle in South Africa must be
handed. We lacked that in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Inqaba puts forward a theory and a strategy which can guide the
working class movement in the struggle for power something the ANC
leadership has not done &#8211; something we can say the South African
Communist Party has <em>failed</em> to do. I say &#8220;failed&#8221; because
time and time again it has been advised by workers to change its
methods and has failed to do so.</p>
<p>The Communist Party leaders still refuse to put forward that the
task of the working class will be to take power in the revolution
that is coming in South Africa. These leaders have put forward the
position that we must struggle for a bourgeois democracy in South
Africa &#8211; and the South African Communist Party has said over and
over again that we must wait until getting that before struggling to
overthrow capitalism.</p>
<p>Workers want democratic rights of course. When in Europe I see I
can stand right next to a policeman and sell a socialist newspaper,
and he doesn&#8217;t turn a hair, it amazes me. The workers in Europe
have struggled for and won these rights &#8211; although the capitalists
are now trying to whittle them away. And I think: &#8220;If the workers
in SA had those rights just for a month, or even 24 hours, what would
they begin to do with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the point is: it will take a revolution in South Africa &#8211; a
revolution made by the power of the working class &#8211; to achieve full
democratic rights. And I ask: when the workers in South Africa push
back the state to that point, why should they stop there?</p>
<p>Why should they stop just because their leaders are then
scrambling for positions in the bosses parliament? The workers will
then have the power to take over the factories and mines and so on,
and to take on and destroy the bosses&#8217; state. That is what they
will demand that their leaders carry through.</p>
<p>I came to the conclusion in the 1950s that we were faced with a
crisis of leadership. Subsequently I have discovered that the reasons
for this crisis were explained by the Russian Marxist, Trotsky.</p>
<p>Trotsky had already explained that in Russia the basic problems of
the masses could not be solved unless the working class took power.
It is the same in South Africa &#8211; race discrimination even cannot be
ended short of that. It was proved in Russia when the working class
came to power in 1917 under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party,
headed by Lenin and Trotsky.</p>
<p>Later Trotsky also explained how the workers&#8217; democracy which
came into existence in the Soviet Union was crushed by the coming to
power of Stalin and the bureaucracy- how this led to the degeneration
of the workers&#8217; state and the degeneration of the Communist
International, so that Communist Parties no longer stood for the
interests of the working class internationally.</p>
<p>Today it is more clear than ever that the working class can change
society, <em>if it is organised with the correct policy and
leadership</em>. The concept is held by people outside South Africa
and even inside that the regime cannot be conquered. But the working
class is proving today that it can remove it: soften it up first and
then destroy it. This is happening through the workers, not through
the so-called &#8216;armed struggle&#8217;.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Armed Struggle</h4>
<p class="fst">One thing I must make explicitly clear. You can change nothing in
space outside the influence of force. You can&#8217;t move anything say,
from this table to that table, unless you use force.</p>
<p>To change society from one state to another, like we want to do in
South Africa; to remove racism and establish democracy, to remove
capitalism and build socialism &#8211; we need force. And that force in
my conviction is in the working class.</p>
<p>It is a question of the workers using force and violence in their
proper place. There will come a stage when, to eliminate a
highly-armed regime like the South African regime, the workers will
have to be ready militarily, trained themselves. That is inevitable.
The Russian workers in the October Revolution were not empty-handed &#8211;
they organised themselves in an armed workers&#8217; force.</p>
<p>In anticipation of such a situation, the workers must be prepared.
The ruling class must find that they cannot spread their army all
over the country, because the workers are organised everywhere. Then,
when we are physically attacked in any area of the country, we will
be able to hit back and they will find they can no longer control us.</p>
<p>In the 1960s the ANC made me &#8216;political commissar&#8217; in the
camps in Tanzania. My task was to provide political education for the
workers there. I call them workers because many of them had been
trade unionists and, even though they were militarily trained, they
still had the standpoint of workers, to overthrow the South African
regime and capitalism.</p>
<p>I put the position among these comrades that only the working
class could overthrow the state because who else could do it in
isolation from the workers. Therefore trained people infiltrated into
the country should not start to initiate battles, because they would
only be exposing themselves in front of a powerful regular army which
would just destroy you if it discovered you.</p>
<p>The proper thing to do, I said, when you enter the country is to
organise the workers &#8211; and, through them, the masses as a whole &#8211;
and to explain that only the organised working class had the power to
defeat the state. And to prepare, only, for when it would be
effective to use arms. The guerilla methods put forward by the ANC
leadership do nothing more than frighten the enemy from time to time.</p>
<p>Later on I have been to China. I have seen the cave in Yenan which
was Mao&#8217;s home and command centre in the guerilla war in China. The
situation in our country is quite different. It is a very
industrialised country, where there is no real force of opposition
other than the working class. The method of guerilla war is not the
method of working class struggle.</p>
<p>After a time in Tanzania the ANC leadership told me that I should
no longer teach Marxism. In fact the person who initiated this was
none other than the late Moses Kotane, then the General Secretary of
the South African Communist Party.</p>
<p>It astounded me that when he said we must teach instead the
&#8216;African image&#8217;. This is ludicrous. Right back in the Communist
manifesto it was explained that &#8220;All hitherto existing history is
the history of <em>class</em> struggle.&#8221; Of course national
oppression is central in South Africa, but that does not make the
struggle against it any less a class struggle</p>
<p>Because I would not accept the position of the leadership, it was
decided to get rid of me. I was removed from the camps, and the
Tanzanian government gave me seven days to leave the country! I heard
later that at the Morogoro conference, ANC comrades asked, &#8220;Why did
Sejake leave the ANC?&#8221;, and the leadership said, &#8220;He just left
... just like that&#8221; &#8211; which is a thing serious comrades do not
believe to this day.</p>
<p>After that I was for a time in the Pan African Congress, because
the youth there were keen to study Marxism. But the same crisis
revealed itself: the nationalist leadership felt threatened by
working class ideas, and I was expelled.</p>
<p>When I look back now to the 1950s I see that the major problem was
that we, the workers, who supported and built the ANC, did not
control it. Even SACTU was under the control of middle class ANC
leaders, rather than the other way around. Everywhere the working
class movement has &#8211; <em>must have</em> &#8211; two arms: &#8220;an
industrial arm and a political arm&#8221; as the great Irish Marxist,
James Connolly, once said. Both these arms are necessary. They go
together. The one without the other will not succeed.</p>
<p>The workers, on their own account, have rebuilt a powerful trade
union movement in our country &#8211; more powerful than we ever had in
the 1950s. This is a tremendous achievement, even though there is
still a long way to go in organising the unorganised workers.</p>
<p>I have been inspired by the workers organised in the Metal and
Allied Workers Union (MAWU), who have taken forward with courage and
success the work which we began in the 1950s. I regard myself as a
member of MAWU.</p>
<p>These achievements must never be compromised or sacrificed. It is
now vital that they are taken forward in creating a new united trade
union federation, to strengthen our ability to organise and to use
the strike weapon, very intensively, all over the country. Wherever
there is a working concern, a factory, anywhere in the country, there
is the revolution &#8211; provided the working class is organised and
knows its power.</p>
<p>At the same time I agree fully with Inqaba when it says that the
trade unions should join and play their part in the United Democratic
Front (UDF), <em>transform the UDF into a mass working class movement</em>,
able to give a lead to all the oppressed &#8211; and to white workers
too.</p>
<p>The laws of history work in peculiar ways. In the 1950s, the
workers turned to the ANC as the political organisation which they
felt it was necessary to support and strengthen. Today we see the
response which just the launching of the UDF gained from the
unorganised and many others.</p>
<p>This is because workers saw here a sign of the ANC reborn in the
country, a sign of the return of nation wide organisation around the
<em>Freedom Charter</em>.</p>
<p>It is true that the leadership of the UDF as was the case with the
ANC, in the 1950s (and is still the case today), is in the hands of
the middle class. But the workers must go into the UDF &#8211; and later
into the ANC when it returns openly to South Africa &#8211; no to bow
down to the leaders&#8217; policies, their hesitations and twists and
turns, but to <em>transform</em> the UDF and <em>transform</em> the ANC.</p>
<p>I appeal particularly to the workers in MAWU, the union to which I
belong, to press this task on their leaders and on the leaders of
FOSATU and all unions. It is only by the workers going into the UDF
at every level, in an organised and united way, that we can get rid
off the influence of the middle class leadership.</p>
<p>We must simply tell them openly that they must accept the
programme of the working class or else it is time they left their
positions. There is no problem in that. If the organised working
class can take on the big bosses and the state, there is no problem
in dealing with individuals who are an obstacle to the movement.</p>
<p>This is in the interests of the majority of the middle class too.
Only the working class can liberate them from their oppression by
racism and capitalism &#8211; by overthrowing the state and taking power.
The majority of the middle class will follow a determined lead from the workers.</p>
<p>History will not allow us to postpone this task while we sort out
merely our own &#8216;trade union affairs&#8217;. In fact by transforming the
UDF we will strengthen the whole workers&#8217; movement, the trade unions too.</p>
<p>With the UDF under working class leadership, campaigning for
demands like a minimum wage, it will win the enthusiastic support of
many of the most oppressed whoa re still unorganised. On the other
hand, if the trade union movement remains divided on the question of
the UDF, this can become a barrier to forming the strongest possible
trade union unity in action.</p>
<p>But because from my experience I am confident in the power and the
understanding of the workers, I am sure we are bound to succeed in
building our two arms; the industrial arm and the political arm.</p>
<p>The success will be so tremendous and vibrant that it will shake
the whole of this globe! The South African regime is one of the worst
in the world, and if the African working class understand and apply
Marxist theory correctly they will give some meat to the working
class of the world and gain tremendous support.</p>
<p>I have found that Europe, and the whole of the capitalist West, is
no longer what we thought it was. Conditions are getting worse, in
every country, because of the grip of capitalism. Therefore the
workers are struggling against it.</p>
<p>So workers in South Africa should not look at the West simply as a
place from which imperialism exploits them, without anybody
struggling to put a stop to this. Struggle is going on!</p>
<p>But I have also found the same crisis of leadership of the
workers&#8217; movement. Take Ireland, for example: the Labour Party is
in a coalition government with a capitalist party that has nothing in
common with the workers. It is like the SACP calling for &#8216;an
alliance of all classes&#8217; &#8211; how can workers be in alliance with
their bosses?</p>
<p>Or take the example of Britain, where the Labour Party leadership
has been trying to expel Marxists. It reminds me of the action taken
by the ANC leadership against me. But I find in these countries a
growing enthusiasm for Marxist ideas, especially among the youth and
young workers, but among older workers also. Recently I went to a
Young Workers&#8217; Assembly organised by the British Labour Party Young
Socialists, where I heard many youth and others speaking.</p>
<p>Some were real youngsters, even one &#8216;small boy&#8217; (I use this
with no disrespect) whose speech made me feel that at his age I had
no idea of struggle. This is because of the change that is taking
place in the working class today. In Soweto, too, four-year-old
children are confronting the police.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the development of a new period in the world. We have
reached the stage of the advent of world revolution. I can see this
is no longer a theory. It is a reality. I can safely say that world
revolution is approaching the doorsteps of the homes where we live
and the sooner we wake up to the occasion the better.</p>
