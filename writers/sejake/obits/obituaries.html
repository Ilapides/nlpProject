<h2>Black South African workers&#8217; leader and fighter for socialism</h2>
<p class="fst">The CWI is sad to announce the death of Nimrod Sejake, a life-long
fighter against apartheid in South Africa, and a committed socialist.
Nimrod died on 27 May 2004, aged 83 years.</p>
<p>During the 1950s, Nimrod was a black workers&#8217; leader in South
Africa under the former apartheid regime, a leading member of the
South African Congress of Trade Unions, and of the ANC in the Soweto Township.</p>
<p>Forced into exile, Nimrod eventually arrived in Ireland in the
1980s. He became a supporter of the &#8216;Militant&#8217;, the forerunner of
the Socialist Party (CWI affiliate), and joined the Marxist Workers&#8217;
Tendency of the ANC.</p>
<p>Nimrod was a well-known and loved figure on the left in Ireland.
He regularly travelled across the country, south and north, to speak
at public meetings on the struggle of the black South African working
class. Nimrod also regularly attended international meetings
throughout Europe. At all times, he was an inspiration, particularly
to youth.</p>
<p>Following the removal of the apartheid regime in the 1990s, Nimrod
was eventually allowed to return to South Africa. But for Nimrod the
struggle was not over, once back in South Africa he continued to
campaign for a socialist society.</p>
<p>The following is an obituary article on Nimrod that recently
appeared in the <strong>Irish Times</strong> newspaper. It indicates the
stature Nimrod has in Ireland, amongst the anti-apartheid movement
and the left.</p>

<h2>Tireless activist who spent 30 years in exile</h2>

<p class="fst"><strong>Nimrod Sejake:</strong> Nimrod Sekeramane Sejake, who has died aged
83, was a South African political refugee in Ireland during the
1980s, when he became widely known in trade union and socialist
circles for his campaigning work to raise the profile of the new
South African unions.</p>
<p>Born in August 1920 in Evaton, south of Johannesburg, to Basotho
parents, he attended mission school in Evaton, worked as building
site clerk, trained as a teacher, married, and settled in Jabavu, Soweto.</p>
<p>As the National Party came to power in 1949 and sought to impose
unprecedented racial discrimination under the rubric &#8220;apartheid&#8221;,
Sejake joined the opposition. Noted for his ability as a union
organiser, he became secretary of the non-racial, though mainly
African, Iron and Steel Workers Union, affiliated to the South
African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU). His militant,
uncompromising approach is recorded in <strong>Organise or Starve</strong>, the
history of SACTU.</p>
<p>Sejake joined the African National Congress (ANC) and was active
throughout the 1950s in its increasingly radical Defiance Campaign of
demonstrations, strikes and burning of the hated pass books. He was
active also in the Congress of the People of 1955 when the ANC
proclaimed the <em>Freedom Charter</em> at Kliptown.</p>
<p>Sejake shared a cell with Nelson Mandela, when they were both
arrested with 156 leaders of the ANC, SACTU and the Communist Party
(SACP), accused of treason in the famous treason trial of 1956&#8211;61.
The NP government sought the death penalty for treason and, as
oppression intensified, limiting the possibilities for legal
political work, Sejake and others left the country through the then
Basutoland for training in the Soviet Union. The treason trial
accused were acquitted but the die was cast and Umkhonto We Sizwe
(MK), the ANC&#8217;s military wing, was founded to begin armed struggle
against the apartheid regime.</p>
<p>Sejake spent a period studying Marxism in the USSR. He had been
influenced by a teacher in Evaton in the 1930s, Johannes Nkosi, a
leading member of the Communist Party. Nkosi had been sent to the
Soviet Union where he fell foul of the Stalinist teachers and died in
suspicious circumstances. Like others of the ANC and similar
liberation movements, Sejake found that only the &#8220;communist&#8221;
states were prepared to provide arms and training, whatever
criticisms they had of the system were not voiced then.</p>
<p>Sejake returned to Africa as political commissar in the ANC
training camp in Morogoro, Tanzania. He was convinced of the central
role of the organised working class in the liberation of South
Africa, and insisted their priority should be to send trained
activists back to organise militant trade unions to bring down the
regime. Such views led to a clash with the more conservative exiled
leadership which prioritised the armed struggle and appeals to the
United Nations.</p>
<p>Sejake was removed from his post. The President, Julius Nyerere,
ordered his expulsion from Tanzania, a decision probably influenced
by Mr. Sejake&#8217;s involvement in a Marxist circle at Dar es Salaam
University which was critical of Nyerere&#8217;s &#8220;Ujaama&#8221;, or African
Socialism. Participants included Zanzibarian A.M. Babu, later jailed
by Nyerere, and Walter Rodney, author of the influential <strong>How
Europe Underdeveloped Africa</strong>, and assassinated by the CIA in
Guyana in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Exiled to Zambia, Sejake worked with the South African
Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC), and travelled to China and Albania,
seeking support for the organisation, before being deported to Egypt,
where he lived in poverty while appealing for political asylum in
Europe. In these difficult times, he was greatly heartened by the
uprising of the South African school students in Soweto, 1976 and by
the rapid growth of the independent trade unions.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, Sejake was offered asylum in three European
countries and chose Ireland, remembering that his sister worked for
an Irish family as a domestic servant. They treated her well and he
was impressed when they told her Ireland was a country oppressed by
the British Empire!</p>
<p>Living in the Red Cross Hostel in Ballsbridge, Sejake loved
Ireland and never experienced racial abuse. He attended AGMs of the
Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement but was disappointed to find no
recognition of the now hugely significant independent unions. He
found kindred thinkers in the Militant Tendency of the Labour Party
[forerunners of the Socialist Party] which had direct links, through
South African exiles, with these rapidly growing unions. A &#8220;retying
of the knot&#8221;, he would say, after 25 years in exile.</p>
<p>He devoted himself energetically to solidarity work with the
struggle in South Africa, speaking at meetings the length and breadth
of Ireland and Britain, taking particular pleasure in engaging with
young people. He made speaking tours throughout Europe, the US and
Brazil, and during the 1984/85 anti-apartheid strike at Dunnes
Stores, was regularly found on the picket line.</p>
<p>In 1989 he spoke by phone to his wife and family with whom he had
not been in contact for 30 years. The ANC was legalised, Mandela
walked free, and the exiles returned, although his own return was
delayed for months when he refused to complete the application for
indemnity. He complained, &#8220;they are asking me which crimes I wish
to be indemnified for!&#8221; Eventually he returned to South Africa in
November 1991.</p>
<p>Reunited with his family, though 71 years of age, Sejake again
threw himself into the struggle and was elected secretary of the
Soweto ANC Veterans League and led delegations from Evaton to
Pretoria to seek compensation for land seized during the 1950s. He
also re-established links with the workers in heavy industry through
the Metal and Allied Workers Union.</p>
<p>Although he voted for the ANC in the 1994 election, he insisted
that the massive vote for the party would not be enough to transform
life for the poor in South Africa. He remained a committed socialist
and marxist, believing that only the overthrow of capitalist economic
relations would end inequality and he was involved in campaigning for
the Congress of South African Trade Unions to build a mass workers party.</p>
