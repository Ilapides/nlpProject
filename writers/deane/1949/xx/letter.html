<p class="fst">Dear comrades,</p>

<p class="fst">Discussion in the Party on the question of entry has naturally
provoked a crisis in the organisation. The comrades will know that on
the P.B., the C.C. and in the Party generally we have maintained that
under the given conditions, the best tactic for the party is the
maintenance of our independence.</p>

<p>The discussion has not convinced us that in the present situation
entry would constitute a superior tactic. However, faced with the
overwhelming majority of the leadership and the trained cadres, and a
substantial section of the rank and file are in favour of entering
the Labour Party, and given that the objective situation will be a
difficult one for the Party, we believe that a struggle would be
sterile. We say this for the following reasons.</p>

<p>With the development of the Labour movement and the tendency
within it at the present time, it is possible that entry would have
to be undertaken in any event a few years hence. The historical
tendency in the labour movement has been for the Labour Party to
reflect the developments taking place within the working class. At
periods of quiescence the right wing has always maintained its hold
over the Labour movement as a whole. Just as in the trade unions and
the shop-stewards committees in periods of lull, the reactionary and
backward elements, play an important role. With the upsurge of the
workers they are swept away and younger and more militant elements
are pushed forward by the workers. Similarly in relation to the L.P.
As the political expression of the trade union movement, in the event
of a crisis affecting the regime, the L.P. will be shaken to its
depths and an entire reshuffle of the leading strata would take
place. Under these circumstances the question of entry would be posed.</p>

<p>Taking all the above factors into consideration, and the undoubted
fact that even under the best conditions with a unified leadership
imbued with confidence in the tactic, only small gains could be made
in the immediate period ahead; with the prospect of building an
entirely new leadership, all the advantages of conducting a struggle
and attempting to continue with the open organisation, would be
cancelled out. This is particularly applicable, as the possibility
exists of entry in the future.</p>

<p>Therefore, given the above mentioned conditions, the objective and
subjective conditions would be unfavourable for the maintenance of
the independent Party.</p>

<p>Particularly is this so as certain necessary safeguards are agreed
on by all &#8211; entrists and non-entrists alike. 1) A theoretical
journal, and 2) A tight organisation.</p>

<p>Entry is a tactical issue and does not involve questions of
principle. Above all, it is necessary to maintain a due sense of
proportion and to see the problem as purely a practical one as to the
best method of the deployment of forces we possess.</p>

<p>Under different conditions, if really favourable prospects for
growth presented themselves, for the independent party, then it might
be necessary to maintain a small grouping even against the
overwhelming majority of the party. But the present situation is
entirely different. Nationally and internationally, the main task
consists in maintaining the organisation and preparing for the great
historical tasks which history will pose before us in the future.</p>

<p>We do not believe there are great opportunities for the growth of
our movement at present wherever we operate. In this period the most
important task consists in the maintenance of the unity of the
organisation, the intensification of the education of our cadres and
raising the theoretical level of the entire organisation. These tasks
will pose themselves as vital for the future, whether we are inside
or outside.</p>

<p>Under these conditions, we do not believe it is in the best
interests of the movement to wage a struggle on this issue.</p>
