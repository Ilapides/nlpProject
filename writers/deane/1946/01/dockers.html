<p class="fst"><strong>THE REACTION OF THE DOCK WORKERS TO THE 19/&ndash; A DAY PROPOSED BY THE EVERSHED COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY INTO DOCK WAGES, HAS BEEN ONE OF BITTERNESS AND DISGUST.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The immediate reaction of the London Central Strike Committee was to condemn and reject the proposals of this committee, which are 6/&ndash; below the demands of the dockers, and to call upon the Union leadership to give 21 days&rsquo; strike notice.</strong></p>

<p><strong>As we go to press, the National Strike Committee, meeting in Liverpool, has decided to accept the Evershed proposals. But this is not the end of the struggle. Within a short time the dockers will be on the move again in their fight for a decent wage.</strong></p>

<p>The role of the Donovans, the Deakins and the Labour Government in the wage negotiations will serve to teach the dockers and the working class as a whole that they have acted in the interests of the capitalist class. Following the age-old method of killing the workers&rsquo; claims, the Government appointed the Evershed Committee of inquiry 6 days before the termination of the 30 days truce. This was done to avert another national stoppage which most certainly would have taken place as a result of the provocative 2/&ndash; increase offered by the employers. This &ldquo;impartial&rdquo; committee was composed of one capitalist, an ex-chairman of the Metal Box Co. Ltd., to university professors &ndash; priests of capitalist education &ndash; and one individual well trained in the methods of class-collaboration &ndash; an ex-president of the AEU. The chairman of the Committee, Mr. Justice Evershed, is a protector of <em>capitalist</em> law. From such a committee, composed of the representatives of capitalism, no one, least of all the militant dockers, expected much more than is offered.</p>

<p>The Labour Government had every opportunity and possibility to obtain the 25/&ndash; a day demanded by the dockers. Instead of a Commission composed of capitalist agents it could and if <em>a real workers&rsquo; government representing the interests of the workers, would have appointed a commission composed of representatives of the dockers</em>. Thus the workers would have been assured of proposals in their interest and not, as now, in the interest of the employers.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Union Leaders Betray Rank and File</h4>

<p class="fst">The leadership of the dockers&rsquo; unions has earned the bitter opposition and hatred of the rank and file. When the employers made their offer of 18/&ndash;, Donovan and Deakin were compelled to recommend to a national delegate conference the rejection of this offer. The fact that they have now accepted 19/&ndash; only indicates that they have been engaged in backstage collaboration with the employers and the Government in reaching a suitable compromise. <em>Bert Aylwood</em>, the organiser of the London Central Strike Committee, speaking almost a week before the end of the 30 days&rsquo; truce, nailed the policy of the union leaders:</p>

<p class="quoteb"><em>&ldquo;We gave 30 days&rsquo; notice when we resumed work to give the employers one week to meet the issue (25/&ndash; minimum wage). If they did not, the Transport and General Workers Union officials could then give Mr. Issacs 21 days&rsquo; notice that a dispute existed.</em></p>

<p class="quote"><em>&ldquo;Instead of that, the union agreed to discuss something less than 25/&ndash;. There are vested interests in the Transport &amp; General Workers Union and the Stevedores Union who are trying to fog and bamboozle the issue so that at the end of the 30 days we will not know where we are.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p class="fst">The opposition to the official union leaders was clearly shown at the handpicked national delegate conference of the T.&amp;G.W.U. held on 14th December. <em>14 delegates voted against the acceptance of the Evershed proposals.</em> An official meeting of union members was called on the 15th December. <em>Out of more than 10,000 union members in London, about 80 attended the meeting.</em> As soon as the officials read the proposals the vast majority of these walked out leaving the officials on the platform! Deakin and Donovan (despite the fact that the former was recently elected General Secretary &ndash; how this happened no one knows!) have no support whatsoever from the rank and file. The power lies in the hands of the National Strike Committee.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Only a Militant Policy Can Preserve the Rank and File Organisation</h4>

<p class="fst">All the recent events show that the power lies in the hands of the National Strike Committee, which because of its courageous and militant leadership has won the support of dock workers throughout the country. But any compromise or sell-out of the dockers&rsquo; struggle can soon end the unity and organisation won by the strike. Such a compromise would again place the dock workers in confusion and frustration &ndash; ready material for the machinations of Deakin and Donovan. The politically conscious elements on the National Committee must prevent such a degeneration. All the weaknesses must be corrected. Nothing should be permitted to stand in the way of full and serious preparation for the future struggles, and for the removal of the traitorous union leadership and the revival of union democracy. On the basis of a militant policy the present national organisation forged by the dockers can become a most important factor in the struggle of the British working-class for Socialism.</p>
