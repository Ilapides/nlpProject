<p class="fst">&ldquo;<strong>Nationalisation is not intended primarily to benefit the miner. There is the coal consumer to be considered, the interests of the nation, our export trade, and all that.&rdquo; So spoke Mr. Shinwell, &ldquo;Socialist&rdquo; Minister of Fuel and Power, in Glasgow on January 17th.</strong></p>

<p>In simple language this statement means that <em>the coal industry is not being nationalised in the interest of the miners and workers who placed the Labour Government in power, but in the interest of the capitalists and industrialists. By the &ldquo;coal consumer&rdquo;</em> is not meant the <em>worker-consumer</em>, but the <em>big industrial consumers</em> who will sit on the Consumer&rsquo;s Council and have a directing influence upon the administration of the mines.</p>

<p>Speaking a few days later to the American Chamber of Commerce in London <em>Mr. Shinwell</em> placed his finger on the issue. He said: <em>&ldquo;We have to cheapen the cost of production because this industry ministers to the needs of the basic element of production.&rdquo;</em> Shinwell this makes it clear that the Nationalisation Bill is a state-capitalist measure, <em>dictated by the needs of capitalist economy</em>.</p>

<p>The nationalisation, reorganisation, and consequent increased production will mean cheaper coal. The export industries, particularly the steel and auxiliary industries, will buy coal at a cheaper price and will therefore be able to reduce the price of export commodities and compete more efficiently on the world capitalist market. <em>This is &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; the purpose of the</em> Nationalisation Bill.</p>

<p>Lest there be doubt that the needs and conditions of the miners were the <em>last consideration</em> in the Nationalisation Bill, <em>Mr. Shinwell</em> again stated in his speech to the American Chamber of Commerce:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&ldquo;But there must be a proviso that such cheapening must be consistent, <em>so far as practicable</em>, with decent and human standards of living for those employed in the industry.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Coal-Owners Compensated</h4>

<p class="fst">If one considers that the cost of the nationalisation scheme, to be paid from public taxes, will be in the region of <em>&pound;20 million a year</em>, and that <em>&pound;150 millions will be loaned to the Coal Board from the proceeds of the industry</em>. To pay these fabulous sums and at the same time reduce the price of coal for industries and export can only mean increased sweat for the miners.</p>

<p>Precisely here is the role of the traitorous union leaderships. The leadership of the Mineworkers&rsquo; Union has undertaken the production drive on behalf of the Government. Horner, a &ldquo;Communist&rdquo;, is the Dr. Ley! The miners are to be exhorted to increase their already inhuman sweating &ndash; for the benefit of capitalist industry and the coal owners who are guaranteed a profit of &pound;9&frac12; millions a year in the form of compensation.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Capitalist Managers to Stay</h4>

<p class="fst">The entire administration is, according to Mr. Shinwell, <em>&ldquo;to be in the hands of a business corporation, administering this great national industry for public well-being.&rdquo; &ldquo;This is to be a fair field for men of business capacity and other qualifications.&rdquo;</em> The mines will not only minister to the needs of capitalist industry but it will remain <em>in the controlling hands of capitalist managers and technicians</em>.</p>

<p>Small wonder that the coal-owners have accepted the Government&rsquo;s Nationalisation Bill! Their only demand is that compensation should be paid in cash and not Government bonds. <em>Not a thing is to be changed &ndash; except that the whole burden, the whole cost of reorganisation and the production of cheaper coal is placed on the shoulders of the miners and the workers as a whole.</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&ldquo;Unofficial Disputes To Stop&rdquo; &ndash; Shinwell</h4>

<p class="fst">All the disciplinary measures necessary to drive the miners will be used by the Labour Government. Forseeing an increase in miners&rsquo; strikes against low wages and filthy conditions, Mr. Shinwell, in his Glasgow speech stated: &ldquo;I consider that unofficial disputes should stop. I am contemplating as a last resort drastic action.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The present Nationalisation Bill of the Labour Government in no way differs from the measures taken in other capitalist countries &ndash; including Germany. It is a measure dictated by the needs of capitalism and has nothing in common with socialism.</p>

<p><em>Only the operation of this industry under workers&rsquo; control and the abolition of compensation can solve the problems of the coal industry and better the conditions of the miners and the working class.</em></p>
