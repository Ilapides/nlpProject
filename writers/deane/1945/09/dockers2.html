<p class="fst"><em>Despite their militancy and desire to struggle, the London
dockers and stevedores have returned to piece-work on the pre-Second
Front rates of pay. In accordance with their wartime agreement they
have given 28 days&#8217; notice to the employers terminating all
piece-work agreements.</em></p>

<p>This return to work postpones the struggle of the London
dockworkers for 25/&#8211; a day guaranteed pay. In the meantime,
however, a national delegate conference of the T. &amp; G.W.U. Docks
Section, which was forced by the actions of the London dock workers,
has instructed the Union leadership to go forward for 25/&#8211; a day
and support the demands of the London dockers.</p>

<p>The feeling of the dockers and stevedores at the moment is one of
frustration and bitterness. For weeks the union officials had tried
to get the men back to work. Each time their strike-breaking policy
was mouthed they were howled down. But after more than two months of
struggle <em>the very committee which was formed to replace the
reactionary strike-breaking Union leadership, the Progressive
Committee, supported the plausible back-to-work formula of Barratt</em>,
the Stalinist General Secretary of the Stevedores&#8217; Union.</p>

<p>The real nature of this back-to-work agreement is already making
itself clear. The employers have suspended more than 1,500 men for
refusing to piece-work during the dispute. Though the suspensions
have been lifted in the East India dock, the main body of the men
will be forced to take their suspensions. The dock workers ask: <em>If
we had defeated the bosses is it possible that they would dare
provoke us with these vicious acts?</em> It is clear to them that the
return to work on the bosses&#8217; conditions was a victory for the bosses.</p>

<p>What <em>Donovan</em>, the General Secretary of the T.&amp;G.W.U.
Docks Section, <em>could not do, Barratt</em>, who claims to be a
&#8220;Communist&#8221;! &#8211; and the hesitancy of the Progressive Committee
succeeded in doing: <em>they got the men back to work knowing that
this would break the back of the dock workers&#8217; struggle.</em></p>

<p>The case for the return to piece-work was presented by the
Progressive Committee as a means of strengthening the dockers&#8217;
struggle by legalising their so-called &#8220;go slow&#8221; policy. The
Progressive Committee stated that at the end of their 28 days&#8217;
notice they would be in a better position to lead the struggle. Only
on this understanding did the men agree to return to work. What
actually happened? <em>Within ten days of making this pledge, the
Progressive Committee decided to dissolve!</em> It claimed that it had
fulfilled its purpose. From this, one is entitled to ask: <em>was it
the purpose of the Progressive Committee to get the men back to work,
that is, to break the struggle?</em> This is clearly what it amounts
to. <em>Instead of using the 28 days to thoroughly organise and
prepare the struggle, which is what a truly Militant Committee would
have done, the Progressive Committee decides to disband!</em></p>

<p>The reaction of the dock workers to this act, which is either a
product of naive faith in the Donovans or of underhanded Stalinist
work, is one of disgust and amazement. A number of members of the
Progressive Committee and outstanding dock leaders expressed their
opposition to this policy and intention to organise rank-and-file
committees. <em>All serious militants will strive to organise militant
rank-and-file committees.</em></p>

<p>Never have workers shown such militancy as the London dock
workers. Everything was there &#8211; national support, solidarity with
other ports. Only a militant leadership based upon a clear
understanding was needed. The responsibility for the present
situation must rest where it belongs: firstly on the shoulders of the
Donovans and Barratts, secondly on the Progressive Committee, which,
through its lack of organisation and hesitancy left the dock workers leaderless.</p>

<p>The Progressive Committee has done some good work, but all this
has been destroyed by its most recent act. The main lesson of the
London struggle is the need to organise rank-and-file committees,
establish permanent national contact, and prepare for the inevitable
struggles of the future.</p>
