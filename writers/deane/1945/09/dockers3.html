<p class="fst"><strong>The first round of the Stevedores&#8217; and Dockers&#8217; fight for
25/&#8211; a day national minimum has ended with a temporary victory for
the Bosses. The Dockworkers&#8217; struggle, which was opposed by the
Union leaders, has been sabotaged by the Stalinists.</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Barratt Withdraws 28 Days&#8217; Notice</h4>

<p class="fst"><em>The London Stevedores have learned with disgust that their
General Secretary, Barratt, has withdrawn the 28 days&#8217; notice to
the employers terminating all piece-work agreements. They have called
him to a mass meeting to explain his actions which are contrary to
union rules.</em></p>

<p><em>Barratt and the Progressive Committee had advised the
dockworkers had advised the dockers to return to piece-work for 28
days in order to strengthen the hands of the Union Leaders and the
Progressive Committee.</em> On this understanding the men agreed to
return. Within a few days, <em>they received the astounding news that
the Progressive Committee had decided to dissolve!</em> Now they have
learned that the 28 days notice has been withdrawn! Thus, the Union
leaders have them back at work, confused and leaderless.</p>

<p>Until recently many sincere militants could not believe that
<em>Barratt</em> &#8211; a &#8220;Communist&#8221;! &#8211; and the <em>Progressive
Committee</em> &#8211; a &#8220;militant committee&#8221; &#8211; would be partners to
such a disgusting sell-out. It is now clear, no matter what excuses
are offered &#8211; and plenty will be invented &#8211; that Barratt and the
Stalinists have deliberately smashed the dock workers&#8217; struggles.
His Majesty&#8217;s &#8220;Communist&#8221; Party held special meetings to bring
their members into line &#8211; a Party line of strike-breaking.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Bosses And Stalinists Fear National Link-Up</h4>

<p class="fst">The first militant rank-and-file committee was formed on the
Liverpool docks.</p>

<p>The London dock workers welcomed this committee, and immediately
subscribed &#163;8&nbsp;8s&nbsp;6d. For the committee&#8217;s expenses, as a
gesture of solidarity. Against the Union officials and the
Stalinists, who tried to prevent a national link-up, this committee
established contact with London and other important ports. Every
militant dock worker throughout the country hailed this important
step forward, every capitalist newspaper met it with abuse; every
Trade Union official and Stalinist stooge tried to smash it.</p>

<p>Realising that the creation of militant rank and file committees
in Liverpool and London by the dockers, was the only way was the only
way in which the dock workers could fight the bosses attacks and
prevent the sabotage of their struggles by the Union &#8220;leaders&#8221;,
<em>Donovan and the Stalinists began a national campaign against these
committees and their attempts to form a national movement</em>. This
campaign was, and still is, principally directed against the
Trotskyists and our revolutionary communist policy.</p>

<p>This reactionary campaign, has caused the Liverpool and London
rank and file committees to disintegrate and dissolve, in spite of
the attempts of the militants to maintain them. The supporters of the
Stalinists have left the Dockers and Stevedores high and dry, while
the sincere militant dockers continue the struggle for rank and file
committees, based upon a genuine workers&#8217; programme. The very fact
that these militants are accused of &#8220;Trotskyism&#8221; shows that both
for the bosses and the reactionary Union leadership, Trotskyism and a
militant workers&#8217; struggle are one and the same thing.<br/>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="western">Stalinist Excuses</h4>

<p class="fst">Already the Stalinists are busily engaged in fabricating excuses
for the disgusting role of <em>Barratt</em> and the <em>Progressive
Committee</em>. <em>The most ridiculous, but typical excuse is that the
Dockers and Stevedores did not prove militant enough that they did
not back the Progressive Committee with action! Anyone connected with
the dockers knows the situation; the rank and file were demanding
strike action and were prepared to make any sacrifice to defeat the
bosses; they had national support, and felt confident.</em></p>

<p>The truth of the matter is of course, that the Stalinists are
trying to place the responsibility for temporary defeat, which
rightly belongs to them, upon the shoulders of the dock workers as a
whole. The Progressive Committee persuaded the men to return to work,
not vice versa.</p>

<p>Another of the excuses made by the Stalinists is that all militant
rank and file committees are &#8220;against the unions&#8221;. Every thinking
worker knows how false this is. It is certainly true that all
militant rank and file committees worth anything at all are opposed
to the strike breaking and class collaborationist policy of the Union
&#8220;leaders&#8221;. It is precisely because of the betrayal by the Union
officials that such committees are formed. The very meaning and
significance of the Trade Unions is that they are organisations of
the working class against the capitalists. Militant rank and file
committees along the lines of the Shop Stewards Committees, are not
only necessary in day to day struggles, but also vitally necessary in
the struggles to tear the Trade Unions away from the capitalist
agents and convert them into militant class organisations. Who knows
this better than the Stalinists?</p>

<p>The fact that the Trade Unions are controlled by bureaucrats like
the Donovans and Condons, who are protected by the union
constitutions, a labyrinth of rules and organisational procedure, in
no way alters the need to fight within these unions against all
anti-working-class policies. Any suggestion of forming new unions at
this stage will play right into the hands of the Donovans and the
capitalists.</p>
