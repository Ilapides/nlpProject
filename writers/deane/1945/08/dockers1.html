<h1>Dockers Want 25/&#8211; a Day</h1>

<h3 class="western">(August 1945)</h3>

<p class="info">From <a href="https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/socialist-appeal-uk/index.htm" target="new"><strong>Socialist Appeal</strong></a>, Vol.&nbsp;7 No.&nbsp;11, August 1945, p.&nbsp;1.<br />
Transcribed by Iain Dalton.<br />
Marked up by <a href="https://www.marxists.org/admin/volunteers/biographies/eocallaghan.htm" target="new">Einde O&#8217;Callaghan</a> for the <strong>Encyclopaedia of Trotskyism On-Line (ETOL)</strong>.</p>

<p class="fst"><strong>One of the first acts of the new Labour Government has been to
send troops to the Surrey Docks to unload several ships. This can
only be taken as a deliberate attempt to use men, who were
conscripted under the slogan of fighting fascism, to impose the
employers demands upon the workers at the docks.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The soldiers have &#8220;no heart to do it&#8221; ... &#8220;they
sympathise with the dockers&#8221; and &#8220;hope the Labour Government will
recall them&#8221;, as a couple of soldiers put it to a reporter from the
<em>Socialist Appeal</em>. The dockers don&#8217;t want them to do it, but
they bear them no antagonism because they know they are under
military discipline.</strong></p>

<p>The fact that their own Union leaders oppose the <em>constitutional</em>
action of the dockers condemns these Union leaders as reactionary
bureaucrats.</p>

<p><em>This experience has demonstrated clearly to all militant
dockers that they can expect nothing from the Union bureaucrats.</em></p>

<p>It is this realisation that has caused the dockers, for the first
time, to form a rank and file committee and to establish contact with
other workers throughout the country. The Progressive Committee is an
excellent step in the right direction, but its basis must be
extended. This committee would have the unswerving loyalty of every
dock worker, not only now but after the struggle, if it went before
the men and asked for elected representatives from every section of
the docks. Such a representative committee, thoroughly organised and
prepared, could secure victory for the dock workers. This is a step
which the members of the Progressive Committee must consider immediately.</p>

<p>Contact has already been established with other ports. This
contact must be secured and fully organised. To facilitate this and
at the same time create a national consciousness amongst the dockers,
the dockers must instruct their Union leaders to call a conference of
all dock workers to discuss wages, conditions and organisation. Mr.
Donovan, Secretary of the T.&amp;G.W.U. Docks Section, will try
to side step this demand because it will pose the question of
electing new and militant officials subject to annual election.</p>

<p>The bosses are provoking the dockers, the dockers only answer can
be through organisation and preparedness. Only in this way can
victory be secured.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Withdraw the troops!</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

	<li><strong>Demand that the Labour Government force the employers to
	concede to the dockers&#8217; demands!</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

	<li><strong>For 25/&#8211; a day guaranteed pay.</strong></li>
</ul>
