<p class="fst"><strong>The largest and the most important strike in the history of
Nigeria is now taking place. 150,000 Nigerian administrative service
workers, members of the 17 Government Unions, have been on strike for
more than three weeks. All transport, power and communications
systems throughout Nigeria have been paralysed. The Government has
imposed a strict news censorship, and so far only one London paper
has reported this important strike.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The strike is being led by the Nigerian Trades Union Congress
and is in support for the demand of 2/6d a day minimum wage.</strong></p>

<p>Despite the tremendous difficulties &#8211; the lack of funds, all
sided offensive by the Nigerian Government, arrests of leaders and
suppression of the press &#8211; in its fourth week the strike is still
solid and the strikers determined. Only 200 have scabbed, these have
been given large military escort protection. The rest of the 500,000
workers in Nigeria are in sympathy with the strikers and only waiting
for a lead from the Union leaders to demonstrate their sympathy and
solidarity in action.</p>

<p>On the 21st of May the Nigerian Trades Union Congress sent a
letter to the Government stating:&#8211;</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>The cost of living was officially stated to have
	increased by over 200 per cent.</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

	<li><strong>(a) Recognising this the Government had given
	corresponding increases to European employees &#8211; the salary of a
	European employee is &#163;400 a year.<br/>
(b) Corresponding increases
	had been made in the supplementary allowance for the families of
	European employees;</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

	<li><strong>In view of these facts the N.T.U.C. asked for a minimum
	wage of 2/6d a day;</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

	<li><strong>One month&#8217;s general strike notice was given in support
	of their demands.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">The Governor of Nigeria &#8211; Sir Arthur Richards who earned the
reputation of being a &#8220;<em>firm man</em>&#8221; for quelling the Jamaica
riots &#8211; replied that he would not meet a deputation of the workers
as no purpose could be served by the discussion; that increased wages
would not offset increased cost of living(!) but would only cause
inflation(!); and called upon Africans to help in the equitable
distribution of foodstuffs.</p>

<p>A second appeal to the Government to receive a deputation was made
on June 11th, again this was turned down. Meanwhile the
Government re-enacted its Defence Regulations which were repealed
only a month previous, following which a number of Trade Union
leaders were released after having served four year sentences. The
Defence Regulation on Press Censorship empowers the Governor to close
down any newspaper which publishes news without it first being
censored by the Government, or which criticises any action of the
Governor or his officials. The penalty for contravention of this
Regulation is a fine of <em>&#163;500 or two years imprisonment</em>.</p>

<p>When on June 21st 150,000 administrative workers came out on
strike, immediately the Government suppressed two newspapers, the
<strong>African Pilot</strong> and the <strong>Daily Comet</strong>. The European
community threatened the editor of the latter with lynching. The
Government also took the following steps:&#8211;</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>It threatened not the pay the strikers their June salary
	and to forfeit all their pensions, gratuities and contractual
	rights.</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

	<li><strong>It arrested and later discharged four railway workers&#8217;
	strike leaders on charges of participating in an illegal strike.</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

	<li><strong>It promised that there would be no victimisation of the
	workers if they resumed their duties immediately.</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

	<li><strong>It publicly accused the strikers of sabotaging the
	transport communication systems, leading to the derailment of a
	train at Oshodi, and of cutting the telephone lines between Lagos
	and Minna.</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

	<li><strong>It arrested ten alleged leaders of the strike. Action
	was withdrawn against one when they appeared for trial.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">The leaders of the strike, on behalf of the workers, replied with
five demands. At a great mass rally at Lagos the workers swore on
oath not to return until their demands are met. Their demands are:&#8211;</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Pay the strikers for the period during which they have
	been on strike.</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

	<li><strong>Guarantee their pensions and other rights.</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

	<li><strong>Give an assurance that there will be no victimisation of
	strikers.</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

	<li><strong>Immediately release the strike leaders.</strong><br/>
&nbsp;</li>

	<li><strong>That their original demands be granted.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p class="fst">The high standard of militancy and class awareness of this
comparatively young working-class is further demonstrated by the
treatment given to the president of the Nigerian Trades Union
Congress, <em>Bankole</em>, who advised the workers to return to work.
He was ragged by the strikers and had to be rescued by the police!
Later he was deposed and <em>Imoudu</em>, a young Trade Union leader
just released after four years in gaol, was elected President of the N.T.U.C.</p>

<p><em>The average wage of a Nigerian worker is 10d a day.</em> A year
ago it was raised from 5d to 10d a day. Along with this, discontent
with the dictatorial and arbitrary administration of the British
imperialist Government has been growing steadily. In an attempt to
stem this rising tide the British Government issued in March a White
Paper which announced &#8220;great democratic&#8221; changes in Nigeria. That
these constitutional changes were illusory is clearly demonstrated by
the Government&#8217;s action in face of the elementary demands of the
workers. The White Paper has turned out to be but a flimsy cover for
the dragon tooth and claw of British imperialist domination.</p>

<p><em>Workers everywhere must protest against the policy of the
British Government in Nigeria. Resolutions demanding the release of
the strike leaders, freedom of the press and speech, and the granting
of 2/6d a day by the British Government should be sent to the
Colonial Office immediately.</em> Every organised worker should demand
that the British Trades Union leaders conduct a serious struggle in
support of the Nigerian worker&#8217;s demands.</p>
