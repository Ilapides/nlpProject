<p class="fst"><strong>IT IS with great sadness that we have heard of the death of
Jimmy Deane. When I joined in 1958, Jim was general secretary of the
organisation that became Militant, Militant Labour and the Socialist
Party (CWI section in England and Wales).</strong></p>

<p>He had already been active for over 20 years building the
Trotskyist forces. Alongside Jock Haston and Ted Grant, he played a
leading role during the war in the Revolutionary Communist Party, the
precursor to later Trotskyist organisations, including Militant.</p>

<p>He was an important internationally known leader. His family&#8217;s
council house in Hurlingham Road, Liverpool was corresponded with and
visited by Trotskyists from around the world.</p>

<p>The family came from a rich strand of the workers&#8217; movement. Jim
and his brothers Arthur and Brian recruited their mother Gertie. Her
father was in the Social Democratic Federation and was one of the
first Labour councillors in Liverpool.</p>

<p>Jim made a number of international missions for what remained of
the Fourth International; the organisation set up by Trotsky to
replace the Stalinised Third International.</p>

<p>These included a period in India trying to unite groups in
Calcutta, Bombay and Madras into one all-India organisation.</p>
<p>As an electrical engineer, he courageously volunteered, with
another skilled building worker John Smith, to go to Morocco. This
was in response to a request from the Algerian FLN, fighting for
National Liberation from France, to help them break through the
electrified, Moroccan/Algerian border fences.</p>

<p>All other groups claiming to be Trotskyists then opposed the FLN
or, like the Socialist Workers&#8217; Party in Britain, didn&#8217;t support
national liberation struggles.</p>

<p>I first met Jim at a national committee meeting in London. We used
to travel to these in the back of an old Post Office van driven by
his brother Brian, secretary of the Liverpool branch, accompanied by
Pat Wall and others.</p>

<p>Jim&#8217;s respect among workers was clear to me when &#8211; despite
having moved to London many years before I became active &#8211; he was
greeted by so many delegates to Liverpool trades council and Labour
Party, when he made the occasional visit to their joint open meetings.</p>

<p>We maintained a considerable influence in that body, which had
attendances of between 100 and 200 even, in that period of late
1950s, early 1960s. We benefited from a long tradition of Trotskyism,
which Jim had contributed to with his speeches at dock and factory gates.</p>

<p>Jim was a commanding figure with authority both politically and
with practical organisational ideas. He instilled confidence in what
was a very small organisation but almost totally made up of
industrial workers. When he asked me to move to London to organise
the youth work in 1962, I felt proud to accept.</p>

<p>Despite having to hold down his job to help keep a large family,
Jim kept the administrative work going in that difficult period and
our flag flying nationally and internationally, with polemical
correspondence. He made a huge theoretical contribution, writing very clearly.</p>

<p>He was the most enthusiastic in supporting a new journal to
replace <strong>Socialist Fight</strong>, our spasmodically produced paper. So
the <strong>Militant</strong> monthly was launched in October 1964, with
younger comrades holding key responsibilities, including Peter Taaffe
in Liverpool as editor.</p>

<p>It was Jim at the executive committee who recommended that Peter
Taaffe &#8211; who had been playing a key role on Merseyside, and in
national and international debates &#8211; be brought down to London to
replace himself as general secretary, as Jim had to go to India for
his job. This was unanimously accepted by the executive and national committees.</p>

<p>Jim&#8217;s advice was that the youth should be given their heads and
shouldn&#8217;t wait for older, tired and more conservative comrades. In
a sense he laid the basis for our success.</p>

<p>Jim never really re-entered activity on his return from India, due
to his job and ill health, but he still had the thirst for the
struggle. He spoke at our 1983 meeting in Wigan, against the Labour
leadership&#8217;s witch-hunt of <strong>Militant</strong> supporters.</p>

<p>Tony Mulhearn, a leader of the Liverpool council struggle against
Thatcher&#8217;s government, reminded us recently how Jim was welcomed
and spoke at one of the large public meetings in 1986. He
congratulated the comrades on their success and said how the
Trotskyist pioneers had always looked forward to the day when they
would be able to speak to mass audience of Liverpool workers.</p>
<p>As Peter Taaffe said in his book <strong>The Rise of Militant</strong>:</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8220;Without the struggles of past generations of Marxists,
particularly the pioneers of Trotskyism in Britain, the success of
Militant would not have been possible. The youthful adherents who
joined the ranks of what became Militant in the early 1960s, stood on
the shoulders of those who maintained the Trotskyist traditions in
the most difficult period.&#8221;</p>

<p class="fst">Jim&#8217;s contribution was of major importance and will not be
forgotten, and his approachability and kindness will always be
remembered. Our condolences and sympathy go to all his family and
friends.</p>
