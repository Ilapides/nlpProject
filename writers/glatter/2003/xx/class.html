<P CLASS="fst"><B>Élites after State Socialism: Theories and Analysis</B><BR>Edited
by John Higley and Gy&ouml;rgy Lengyel<BR><I>Lanham: Rowman &amp;
Littlefield, 2000</I></P>
<P CLASS="fst">There is an extraordinary contrast between the confident,
optimistic tone at the beginning of this book and the confusion and
uncertainty at the end. The editors&rsquo; introduction presents a
comprehensive pattern of élites and regimes and sums up the entire
political development of Eastern Europe and Russia from the late
1980s to the late-1990s. A large part of the conclusion, it is true,
follows this up by arguing that élite theory has eclipsed Marxism as
a credible explanation of political change (p. 238). Actually, this
boils down to little more than saying that the term &lsquo;élite&rsquo;
has become fashionable for the second time in a century, but the
voluntary confessions which the authors themselves then make are much
more damaging to their cause. The widespread use of the word &lsquo;élite&rsquo;,
they admit, has not been the result of any revival or development of
<I>ideas</I> about élites. On the contrary, there is &lsquo;something
like a theory void&rsquo;. In other words, this is a theory which
lacks any widely-accepted system of basic terms and concepts even
among its own adherents. It is therefore extremely difficult to test
and not much use as a criteria by which to select data.</P>
<P>The essays in this anthology do, however, share certain basic
attitudes: élitism, for example. On the very first page, the editors
put forward as the premise of the entire volume the view that the
prospects for stability and democracy are crucially dependent on the
&lsquo;extent to which élites trust and cooperate with one another&rsquo;
(p.1). This is echoed in the chapter on Slovakia, while the chapter
on Poland declares: &lsquo;After state socialism in East Central
Europe, politics have become what the majority of politicians, or at
least the dominant politicians, do&rsquo; (p.87). The contributors do
not develop thought-out arguments to substantiate such points or
support them with evidence, they are simply asserted. Another common
attitude favours description rather than analysis. For instance, in
the <I>Introduction</I>, the editors mention that in their model,
reproduction (the occupation of élite positions in the new regime by
the same type of people as in the old) &lsquo;is associated with
fragmented élites&rsquo; (p.11). However, they do not attempt an
explanation as to why this should be so. In his essay on Serbia,
which, while muddled, is a degree more thoughtful than the others,
Mladen Lazi&#263; characterises élite theory as &lsquo;trivial,
descriptive, and non-analytical at the abstract level, though it has
often spawned compelling empirical research&rsquo; (p.126). I thought
this really hit the nail on the head when I first read it; however,
upon further consideration, I found it over-generous. In my
experience of the literature on Russia, it is more often the case
that interesting research on élites dabs itself here and there with a
touch of something fashionable from the world of ideas: it might be a
touch of élite theory, or a hint of democratisation theory, or a
<I>soup&ccedil;on</I> of globalisation theory; it might not have much
to do with the rest of the outfit. <a href="#n1" name="f1">[1]</a></P>
<P>Then there is the light-minded attitude to issues of evidence and
data. The essay on the Czech Republic claims that &lsquo;an almost
complete circulation of the political élite&rsquo; has taken place.
However, the reader is referred to other publications for details of
the research on which this claim is based. The authors of the essay
confess in an aside that &lsquo;methodological problems of sample
selection and representativeness were substantial&rsquo;. But there
is no hint here of what these problems were. The last research
exercise cited in the chapter appears to have been conducted in 1994,
six years before this anthology was published (pp.28-9, 36). The
chapter on Poland is rather more forthcoming, so we know that it is
based on interviews in 1996 with 215 parliamentary deputies and with
61 runners-up. As the authors make clear, their research was about
&lsquo;political élite perceptions of how politics were being played
and what the élite&rsquo;s own roles were in Poland during the
mid-1990s&rsquo;: just the stated perceptions of politicians, nothing
else. This is not uninteresting, but is clearly of limited
significance and not a very firm basis for a confident prediction
that there is little danger of &lsquo;explosive political conflict
... because conflicting élite perceptions ... are substantially
undercut by the common conviction ... about the overriding importance
of continuing market reform and keeping democracy stable&rsquo;
(pp.88-9, 101). The essay on East Germany, which argues that there
has been an extensive circulation of the political élite, is based on
a 1995 survey &ndash; again published elsewhere (pp.13-15,120, fn.
12). The nature of the élite samples in the essay on Serbia is not
made clear. Nevertheless, they are interpreted to support the
argument that the country has an entirely new class structure
(pp.130, 133-5). The essay on business élites in four East European
countries in 1993, seven years before this anthology was published,
is very sketchy about methods, samples and some of its results
(pp.220, 222).</P>
<P>It is important to understand that such attitudes are not confined
to this particular work. They are integral to élite theory and go
right back to the founding fathers. The terms &lsquo;élite theory&rsquo;
and &lsquo;élitist theory&rsquo; have been used interchangeably, and
no wonder: <a href="#n2" name="f2">[2]</a> élitism sought to justify a prejudice as an idea and
was fundamental to the intellectual reaction against Marxism. The
originators of élite theory were predisposed to overestimate the
innate abilities of élites who succeeded in remaining &ndash; or who
came out &ndash; on top. Élites appeared in the work of Robert
Michels, for example, &lsquo;as the infallible architects and supreme
beneficiaries of their own victories&rsquo;. <a href="#n3" name="f3">[3]</a></P>
<P>In the particular case of Eastern Europe, élite analyses, as
Michael Burawoy has pointed out, &lsquo;exclude subordinate classes
which in effect become the bewildered -silent and silenced &ndash;
spectators of transformations that engulf them&rsquo;. <a href="#n4" name="f4">[4]</a> These are
not real subordinate classes, of course. Burawoy is just describing
the way the lower orders appear to the élite mind. The role of the
masses and their relations with their masters and mistresses is a
central issue to which we will return. For the moment, two aspects of
it as regards élite theory are worth mentioning. One is the part mass
action played in bringing about the collapse of Communism in Eastern
Europe. Uprisings and workers&rsquo; movements were, for forty years,
the main and most successful forms of opposition to local élites and
their Soviet backers. Burawoy argues that their significance was not
confined to the Soviet period. As it came to an end, &lsquo;the
compromises struck between dominant and subordinate classes set the
prior conditions for alliances among the dominant classes&rsquo;. In
other words, the class struggle in Eastern Europe had a lot to do
with the terms on which the transition from Communist rule took place
and on the nature and extent of pacts among the élites. Since then,
class divisions have deepened and the struggles they engender have
continued into the new age. Indeed, in large parts of the former
Soviet Union, the passing of the old order marked the beginning of
open class struggle for the first time in over sixty years. <a href="#n5" name="f5">[5]</a> The
second point is that élite theory frees its adherents from having to
pay any attention to the actions of the vast bulk of the population.
This certainly makes the job of the researcher a lot simpler. My own
experience of élite research suggests that it is also very convenient
for the élites themselves: the last thing any important Russians I
spoke to wanted to admit was that anything any ordinary people did
had influenced them in any way whatsoever. The omnipotence of the
powerful and the impotence of the powerless are not tools of
analysis: they are complementary aspects of élitist fantasy.</P>
<P>Similar points can be made about the weakness of classical élite
theory in terms of analysis and evidence. Vilfredo Pareto, for
example, was not much concerned with the factual basis of his ideas
about élite circulation. His interpretation of history - harsh,
vigorous élites alternating with mild, degenerating élites &ndash;
derived from racist theory, and he limited his serious research to
only one actual case: ancient Rome. <a href="#n6" name="f6">[6]</a></P>
<P>But it is not just a question of the theoretical leftovers from
some reactionary intellectuals of a bygone age. The contemporary
study of post-Communist élites is heavily influenced by US literature
of the 1980s about political evolution away from authoritarian
political regimes in South America and southern Europe. This
literature of &lsquo;transition&rsquo;, or &lsquo;transitology&rsquo;,
depicts various scenarios in which arrangements for change or
&lsquo;pacting&rsquo; between élites (and counter-élites) take pride
of place. Once such arrangements have been made, a liberalising
regime can, if it keeps a cool head and a firm grip, expect an
enthusiastic boost from certain social groups as they feel the chains
of authoritarianism slacken. <B>Transitions from Authoritarian Rule</B>,
one of the basic texts of transition theory, looks with particular
favour on the role of artists and intellectuals, &lsquo;privileged
sectors&rsquo;, and &lsquo;middle sectors&rsquo;. You may like to
know, by the way, that it describes the accumulated anger of the
working class and its capacity for independent action as being likely
to make it &lsquo;the greatest challenge to the transitional regime&rsquo;.
<a href="#n7" name="f7">[7]</a></P>
<P>Although regime change is its central issue, this key text has
great difficulty in defining what a regime actually is. <a href="#n8" name="f8">[8]</a>
Everything tends to be seen in terms of relationships between élites,
rather than in terms of structures of power, whether these are formal
or informal, or in terms of relationships between those who have
power and those who do not. What might define such relationships is
completely out of the picture. Instead, the authors make a virtue of
necessity by touting the notion of the uncertainty of transitional
outcomes. Looking at this idea in terms of workers&rsquo; experience
of rationalisation and redundancy in Eastern Europe, Burawoy
remarked: &lsquo;Neoclassical sociologists may celebrate
indeterminacy and uncertain futures, but for most this simply means
insecurity&rsquo;. In this conception, even the élites are agents of
obscure origin in an uncertain universe: the political structures and
socio-economic relationships through which they operate shift hazily
in and out of focus in a thoroughly postmodern manner. The notion of
uncertainty seems to apply most aptly to the theory itself, as a
mid-1990s debate in a major US journal illustrates. <a href="#n9" name="f9">[9]</a></P>
<P>What, for example, is the &lsquo;certain democracy&rsquo; these
writers are implicitly contrasting transitional regimes with? Given
their élitist predilections, it is likely to be some variety of the
&lsquo;democratic élitism&rsquo; so favoured by New Labour, in which
so-called democracy &lsquo;is more important as a method of
generating effective and responsible government than as a means of
providing significant power for the majority&rsquo;. <a href="#n10" name="f10">[10]</a> The fiasco
of the last US presidential election springs immediately to mind. A
Russian joke of the time showed the narrowness of the East-West
divide: &lsquo;we know the result of our elections before the ballot
starts &ndash; you don&rsquo;t know it even after the votes are
counted&rsquo;. There is a connection here between Western élitism
and the westernism of East European intellectuals like Lazi&#263;
which comes out in odd remarks like this:</P>
<p class="quoteb">to anyone who has lived in a socialist country, the need
for expertise in a political élite is self-evident; the individuals
who successively ran state agencies in the fields of culture,
manufacturing, defence, and elsewhere, obviously and woefully lacked
the necessary expertise. (p.135)</p>
<P CLASS="fst">Nothing like Railtrack, then, or Enron&rsquo;s superb efficiency
in disrupting the electricity supply to large parts of California.
And, remember, these are among the highest levels of expertise (and
democracy) the West has to offer.</P>
<P>The élitism of élite theory, its neglect of relations between the
powerful and the powerless, the strength of its prejudices, the depth
of its commitment to the status quo, its failure to develop
explanations, and its weakness with empirical verification deeply
mark this anthology. One result is confusion in the ranks; as this
anthology&rsquo;s conclusion could hardly avoid acknowledging. Not,
at any rate, when the essay on the Czech Republic, the very first
case study in the book, opens with a series of highly sceptical
pronouncements about the idea that élites have played a central let
alone exclusive role in regime change (p.26). Confusion and
scepticism are symptomatic of the inadequacy of the élite school of
thought. Most of the book subscribes unreservedly to what Colin
Sparks and Anna Reading describe in their shrewdly acute survey of
theories of change in Eastern Europe as the &lsquo;total
transformation&rsquo; thesis: &lsquo;The dominant view in the West is
that the revolutions involved profound changes at all levels of
society from the spiritual to the economic&rsquo;. <a href="#n11" name="f11">[11]</a> Some of the
essays do contain elements of an alternative, but these are not
developed. Yet these dissenting voices are worth listening to. The
authors of the four-nation business élite study put their emphasis on
continuity &ndash; not just with the Communist period but even with
the one preceding it (pp.221-3).</P>
<P>A related pattern comes to light in a number of the other essays.
The pattern is one in which there is a generally more significant
degree of continuity in economic élites than in political élites. The
claimed &lsquo;almost complete circulation of the political élite&rsquo;
in the Czech Republic is balanced by a much more sober assessment on
the economic side:</P>
<p class="quoteb">It is obvious, in other words, that economic élite
circulation has not been as comprehensive as political élite
circulation. The economic élite&rsquo;s composition has changed more
slowly and has resulted partly from the normal life cycle
(accelerated somewhat by political considerations), partly from
ongoing structural change (mainly the increased size of the tertiary
sector), and partly from changes in the occupational order itself
(for example, the relative and absolute increases in the number of
people working in information services with business, as opposed to
technical training) (p.33).</p>
<P CLASS="fst">Despite claiming that Serbia acquired a &lsquo;new class
structure&rsquo; during the 1990s (well before the overthrow of
Milosevic), the data Lazi&#263;
presents on Serbia suggests, according to his own evaluation, that
about 60 per cent of the new entrepreneurial class of 1993 &lsquo;gained
their positions directly or indirectly through paternal or spousal
linkages from the old ruling class&rsquo; (p.133).</P>
<P>This pattern of differential continuity is not accounted for by
schemes of change in which élites inevitably play the crucial role.
There is a general assumption in élite theory that power is primarily
about political position. It is implied that if old élites want to
hang on to power then political office will be the primary focus of
their resistance to change. At the same time, there is plenty of
evidence that Communist-era élites were far more interested in
grabbing assets and property than they were in maintaining the old
political status quo. <a href="#n12" name="f12">[12]</a> Such issues go to the heart of the nature
of change in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (FSU). For,
as Sparks and Reading point out, &lsquo;total transformation&rsquo;
necessarily implies &lsquo;radical discontinuities of structures and
personnel in all aspects of life, particularly in the most important
economic, social and political organisations&rsquo;. What Sparks and
Reading found in the media in Eastern Europe was that the old
institutional structures and personnel remained largely intact,
despite the introduction of a market-oriented system comparable to
that in the West. &lsquo;The bulk of the senior staff remained
comfortably in post&rsquo; and &lsquo;retained control of the
institutions&rsquo;. They concluded that change was limited to
political life in the narrow sense and that the social structure
displayed a marked continuity: &lsquo;Those views that stress
discontinuity, and in particular the official Western version as
promulgated by Fukuyama and others writers, bear no relationship
whatsoever to what actually occurred&rsquo;. The only exceptions were
East Germany and, to a lesser extent, Czechoslovakia, where popular
mobilisations broke through top-down control over transition and
drove the Communists from power. <a href="#n13" name="f13">[13]</a></P>
<P>The argument that political change in Eastern Europe and the FSU,
important though it was, did not affect basic socio-economic power
relations originated in the early 1990s, notably with Alex
Callinicos. Marxists like Callinicos are often accused of being too
rigid in their ideas &ndash; ironically, in this case, as one of the
key features of his conception is its flexibility. A &lsquo;substantial
continuity in the core apparatuses of state power and in the
personnel of the ruling class itself&rsquo; <a href="#n14" name="f14">[14]</a> is clearly central
to this approach. But it does not exclude all kinds of changes in the
political regime. On the contrary, it is precisely the combination of
continuity and change which is characteristic of the experience all
over the former Soviet bloc:</P>
<p class="quoteb">As she contemplated today&rsquo;s recycled communists,
who miraculously have discovered the virtues of pluralism, one Polish
lady gave me the following definition of her erstwhile homeland&rsquo;s
governments throughout this century. &lsquo;Same shit, different
flies!&rsquo; <a href="#n15" name="f15">[15]</a></p>
<P CLASS="fst">The extent to which things altered depended largely on local
circumstances, such as the extent to which people in the mass tried
to go further than purely political change. A tad less monolithic
than the &lsquo;total transformation&rsquo; thesis, for which
significant elements of continuity can mean theoretical overload and
a flashing self-destruct button. An example of this is the work of
David Lane, who is represented in this anthology only by a limited
study of the Russian oil élite, Russia being otherwise largely
excluded from the scope of the book. Lane is, in fact, a key member
of the Western intellectual establishment, a leading sociologist both
of the Soviet Union and of post-Soviet Russia. He is also one of the
few specialists to have argued, together with Cameron Ross, that the
new Russian political élite has hardly anything in common with the
old Soviet élite (as usual, a slightly higher level of continuity was
conceded in respect of the economic élite). <a href="#n16" name="f16">[16]</a> In order to produce
this result, they were compelled to insist that only people who were
in an élite position both before and after the collapse of the Soviet
Union counted as evidence of continuity. By applying such
breathtakingly narrow criteria to the interpretation of their
research, Lane and Ross were able to boast that the biggest single
grouping in the Yeltsin political élite, accounting for 45.7 per cent
of the total, had no service in the government or Communist Party of
the Soviet Union. But, even on their own figures, this leaves a
majority of 54.3 per cent who had between one and forty years service
of this kind. <a href="#n17" name="f17">[17]</a></P>
<P>Lane and Ross are a good example of what can happen when a total
transformation thesis is bulldozed through the evidence. Other
Russian specialists have emphasised continuity, notably Olga
Kryshtanovskaya, who produced the classic general study of élites in
post-Soviet Russia, and James Hughes, who laid much of the groundwork
for an understanding of Russia&rsquo;s important regional élites. The
problem here, as with O&rsquo;Donnell, Schmitter and the other
transitologists, was that they tended to overestimate the importance
of direct relations between the élites and underestimate the role of
the political regime. The result was that Kryshtanovskaya, in
collaboration with Stephen White, could not decide whether the new
Russian élite was bifurcated (into political and economic élites) or
&lsquo;trifurcated&rsquo; (once they added the security services).
There followed what was in some ways a mercifully brief contest
between Kryshtanovskaya&rsquo;s &lsquo;three-layered pie&rsquo; and
the &lsquo;marbled cake effect&rsquo; put forward by Hughes, who was
trying to picture the highly integrated élites he had found in
Siberia. <a href="#n18" name="f18">[18]</a></P>
<P>The truth is that there is a high level of continuity and
integration <I>within</I> élite groupings in Russia, while their
relations with each other are competitive and hostile, features which
are quite new. The ruling class is more or less the same as in Soviet
times. So how is it that relations between different parts of that
class (and, by extension, between its top managers and officials) are
so different? An important part of the answer lies in the impact on
the ruling class of the unforeseen and unexpected way the political
regime changed. This was a class whose internal relations had been
structured into a hierarchy by Stalinist institutions, above all the
Communist Party, since its inception. The unexpected collapse of the
party in the course of marketisation and related political reforms
predisposed the ruling class to disunity. The unforeseen collapse of
half the economy provided a keen motivation for rivalry &ndash;
competition over the few key assets which remained: raw materials,
especially oil and gas, the processing of raw materials such as
metals, and arms, the one significant branch of manufacturing which
survived. The ruling class remains but its cohesion has been damaged
by changes in the political regime, largely as a result of its own
miscalculations. This is, of course, a very crude summary. <a href="#n19" name="f19">[19]</a> But
it again emphasises the flexibility of the relationship between
political and social power outlined by Callinicos. Actually, it is
not just a question of Callinicos, or even of Marx. The sad truth is
that you can find a more subtle understanding of the relationship
between regime and social structure in Aristotle than in the rigid
formulations of élite theory. <a href="#n20" name="f20">[20]</a></P>
<P>Shorn of its intellectual pretensions, the basic message of élite
theory is that the best you can hope for is what the élites give you.
If you want something better, then you need better élites &ndash; not
better in terms of some impossible, utopian ideal, but more like
élites in nice places like the USA or the better parts of Islington
(p.239). Marxist thought leads in exactly the opposite direction:
from the great and the good to the despised and underestimated. Once
one starts looking, the potential of anti-élite struggles soon
becomes apparent, even in Russia, where movements from below hardly
existed for sixty years, where the mobilisation against the old
regime was relatively modest and where the difficulties of daily life
are hardly to be exaggerated. <a href="#n21" name="f21">[21]</a></P>
<P>To start with, tell-tale phrases like &lsquo;the danger of a rise
in social tension&rsquo;, crop up even in the writings of the least
radical Russian specialists. Here, for example, is a description of
the dilemma faced by regional élites in oil- and gas-rich western
Siberia in the mid-1990s: &lsquo;Obviously, the territorial
authorities are not ready to undertake additional expenditure, but,
on the other hand, they cannot not do so on account of the danger of
a rise in social tension in the territory&rsquo;. <a href="#n22" name="f22">[22]</a> What was being
said here? The central government was trying to keep as much revenue
as possible flowing in to the centre. To a great extent, it did so by
transferring obligations like welfare benefits to lower level
authorities without a corresponding provision of funds. This pushed
regional budgets into the red even in this comparatively prosperous
region. But the cause of the dilemma was not pressure from the centre
on its own. It was the fact that there was a simultaneous,
countervailing pressure from the local population, which included, of
course, the workers who kept the crucial oil and gas industries
running.</P>
<P>If &lsquo;the danger of a rise in social tension&rsquo; could have
such an effect on élites, then what happens when there is an actual
rise in social tension? In what became known the &lsquo;railway war&rsquo;
of 1998, miners who had not been paid for many months set up railway
blockades all over Russia and were joined by other public sector
workers with similar grievances. Political and economic élites at all
levels were reported to be reacting rather sharply as soon as the
action began to bite. Enterprise directors sent picked workers to
plead with the blockades for raw materials and fuel. First deputy
prime ministers were packed off to major trouble spots with crisis
funds. Central and regional élites blamed each other for money which
had &lsquo;disappeared&rsquo; on its way to the coalfields. The
extensive media coverage of the conflict, the heated denunciations of
the miners by ministers and prominent journalists, not to speak of
the parallels drawn with the British miners&rsquo; strike of 1984-5,
indicated how serious an issue it was. There were even signs that
some of the blockaders were beginning to identify themselves with
&lsquo;enemies of the state&rsquo; such as Chechen fighters, and an
attempt by leading Communist MPs to foment a wave of anti-semitic
attacks after the blockades had been lifted fell flat.</P>
<P>Those who are in thrall to élite theory dismiss such struggles as
being the result of manipulation by one élite against another.
Throughout the autumn and winter of 2000, thousands of parents and
children in the Urals city of Ekaterinburg stopped general Latyshev,
President Putin&rsquo;s new regional representative, from occupying
his designated residence &ndash; a building traditionally used by
4,000 children for a huge range of out-of-school activities. In the
end, Latyshev had to go elsewhere. A leading information service (the
<B>Russian Regional Report</B>) concluded that the whole thing was
just about the local governor, Eduard Rossel, giving his new superior
&lsquo;a public relations black eye&rsquo;. Of course, ordinary
people are prone to manipulation by élites. But this does not mean
that such struggles are not in their own interests. One man taking a
building away from 4,000 children was not in the interest of the
people of Ekaterinburg in 2000, just as being six months behind on
pay was not in the interest of the rail warriors in 1998, and cuts in
welfare benefits were not in the interests of claimants in 1995.</P>
<P>One of the best pieces of evidence against the élitist view comes
right from the top. The latest volume of Boris Yeltsin&rsquo;s
memoirs records the shudders with which he and his cronies recall the
railway war. Some of them wanted to take a hard line but the strength
to do so was lacking. The mood in the corridors of power bordered on
panic, and the head of the federal security service (the re-branded
KGB) had to be replaced by the more reliable Vladimir Putin, a
crucial step on his road to the presidency. But Putin did not make
much difference at the time. One deputy prime minister, Yeltsin
recalls, &lsquo;raced from one coal district to another, signing
agreements almost without looking at them &ndash; anything to come to
terms&rsquo;. The regime muddled through, largely because the miners
and their supporters were politically unclear about how to take
advantage of the government&rsquo;s weakness. The rouble crash in the
summer of 1998 added to their difficulties and hardships. Yet the
memory remained to haunt the most powerful, most élite people in the
country. Anatolii Chubais, the architect of privatisation and
currently the head of the electricity monopoly, is one of those
people. Two years later in the summer of 2000, a worried Chubais
warned Yeltsin about the danger of replacing the then prime minister
with Putin &ndash; the fourth such change in little more than two
years. What worried Chubais was not personal ability or the detail of
élite arrangements, it was that ordinary people might not stand for
it. &lsquo;Remember the railway wars?&rsquo;, he said, &lsquo;This is
something you want to face only once.&rsquo; <a href="#n23" name="f23">[23]</a></P>
<P>One of the appeals of élitism is that it invites complicity. I
remember some time in the late 1970s seeing a couple of National
Front members trying to persuade some young men from West Indian
backgrounds that they were not against all black people, just Asians.
This kind of thing was so common that a militant bus workers&rsquo;
paper I was involved in printed an anti-Nazi poem called something
like &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not you &ndash; it&rsquo;s the other bloke
over there&rsquo;. Nazism is an extreme example, admittedly. There
are less extreme, more sophisticated variants. At least one of them
has a direct bearing on the subject of this review. Slavoj &#381;i&#382;ek&rsquo;s
answer to the question &lsquo;Where do the Balkans begin?&rsquo; is
simple: &lsquo;the Balkans are always somewhere else, a little bit
more towards the southeast ...&rsquo; But his exploration of this
simple answer in terms of specific national perceptions in Europe
leaves none of these identities unquestioned:</P>
<p class="quoteb">For the Serbs, they begin <I>down there</I>, in Kosovo or
in Bosnia, and they defend the Christian civilization against this
Europe&rsquo;s Other; for the Croats, they begin in orthodox,
despotic and Byzantine Serbia, against which Croatia safeguards
Western democratic values; for Slovenes they begin in Croatia, and we
are the last bulwark of the peaceful <I>Mitteleuropa</I>; for many
Italians and Austrians they begin in Slovenia, the Western outpost of
the Slavic hordes; for many Germans, Austria itself, because of its
historical links, is already tainted with Balkan corruption and
inefficiency; for many North Germans, Bavaria, with its Catholic
provincial <I>flair</I>, is not free of a Balkan contamination; many
arrogant Frenchmen associate Germany itself with an Eastern Balkan
brutality entirely foreign to French <I>finesse</I>; and this brings
us to the last link in this chain: to some conservative British
opponents of the European Union, for whom &ndash; implicitly, at
least &ndash; the whole of continental Europe functions today as a
new version of the Balkan Turkish Empire, with Brussels as the new
Istanbul, a voracious despotic centre which threatens British freedom
and sovereignty ... <a href="#n24" name="f24">[24]</a></p>
<P CLASS="fst">The élitist attraction of the westernising intellectual tradition
in Eastern Europe is just as false as the less subtle blandishments
of Nazism. You always run the risk of becoming someone else&rsquo;s
Balkans, someone else&rsquo;s alien, someone else&rsquo;s
&lsquo;unproductive capitalist&rsquo;, someone else&rsquo;s &lsquo;other
bloke over there&rsquo;.</P>
<P>Which brings me, finally, to Machiavelli&rsquo;s smile. You can
see it in the portrait on the front cover of the Penguin edition of
<B>The Prince</B>. Actually, it is more like a faint smirk, and the
lips are tightly pressed together. I have often wondered in recent
years whether Putin&rsquo;s team has not been studying Machiavelli,
especially his warning that &lsquo;there is nothing more difficult to
handle, more doubtful of success, and more dangerous to carry through
than initiating changes in a state&rsquo;s constitution&rsquo;.
Certainly, they have avoided making any formal changes in the
constitution at all, despite introducing some important alterations
in Russian federal arrangements and in the composition of the upper
house of parliament. I imagine, too, that few Russians could read
this phrase without thinking of Gorbachev&rsquo;s ill-judged
tinkering with a Soviet structure in which deep cracks had already
appeared. Machiavelli&rsquo;s warning comes in a passage extensively
quoted by Isaac Deutscher at the beginning of his classic
three-volume biography of Trotsky: <B>The Prophet Armed</B>, <B>The
Prophet Unarmed</B>, and <B>The Prophet Outcast</B>. <a href="#n25" name="f25">[25 ]</a>The gist of
the passage is that unarmed prophets who rely on popular support are
doomed since &lsquo;the populace is by nature fickle&rsquo;. Only
armed prophets have the means &lsquo;to urgently arrange matters so
that when they no longer believe they can be made to believe by
force&rsquo;. <a href="#n26" name="f26">[26]</a> I sense the same faint smirk, the same knowing,
superior tone in these words as in the lesser writings of élite
studies today.</P>
<P>This tone is singularly absent from Machiavelli&rsquo;s dedicatory
letter to his real prince, &lsquo;the Magnificent Lorenzo de Medici&rsquo;.
On the contrary, Lorenzo was blessed with Machiavelli&rsquo;s most
elegant grovelling. Despite many differences of detail, it is
curiously reminiscent of the style in which modern intellectuals
apply for funding. At the letter&rsquo;s climactic conclusion,
Machiavelli pictures Lorenzo, on the high peak of his achievement,
letting his glance drop to its foot, where &lsquo;undeservedly, I
have to endure the great and unremitting malice of fortune&rsquo;.
<a href="#n27" name="f27">[27]</a> So, the faint smirk. And the lips pressed tightly together. If,
like Machiavelli, one is a believer in élites as well as a student of
them, then it makes sense to depict them as if they inhabited a lofty
region too remote from the mob to be sullied by it. If not, then the
sullying bears the promise of liberation.</p>
