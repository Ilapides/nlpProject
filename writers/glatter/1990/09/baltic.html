<p class="info">From <strong>Socialist Worker Review</strong>, No.134, September 1990, p.31.<br />

<p class="fst"><em>THE BEAR&#8217;S Hug</em> (June <strong>SWR</strong>) &#8211; David Viinikka&#8217;s detailed historical justification of Baltic demands for independence &#8211; puts the role of the Western leaders in its true light. Faced with a major issue of human rights they unhesitatingly plumped for &#8216;rulers&#8217; rights&#8217; instead.</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;We&#8217;re not going to cancel the summit just because Lithuanian housewives can&#8217;t heat their coffee on Saturday morning.&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">This remark by an aide to President Bush, quoted in <strong>Newsweek</strong>, can perhaps help us imagine the atmosphere in which intense pressure from the West preceded the first concessions on independence by the Lithuanian government. An article in the <strong>Financial Times</strong> declared that &#8216;the Soviet Union versus Lithuania is not just a football match in which you support either one side or the other&#8217; as this might &#8216;bring down the whole stadium.&#8217;</p>

<p>The article described those who supported Lithuanian demands as &#8216;armchair warriors&#8217; and &#8216;simple minded.&#8217;</p>

<p>But perhaps this is not such a bad point. Who would want independence at the cost of pushing the entire USSR with its 300 million people over the edge into complete chaos?</p>

<p>I think one answer to this is that the leaders of the USSR, like their Western counterparts, do not inhabit quite the same &#8216;stadium&#8217; as the average citizen.</p>

<p>They do not suffer from the chaos caused by shortages of food, consumer goods and housing.</p>

<p>&#8216;Chaos&#8217; to them is simply the end of their dominion over one sixth of the earth&#8217;s surface.</p>

<p>A more important answer is that there seems to be a connection between the different types of opposition to the central Soviet bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Of these the most important are undoubtedly the stirrings among the Russian working class, the only force, as in Tsarist times, in a position to break the system at its heart.</p>

<p>The <strong>Guardian</strong> reports workers in the Siberian oilfields as saying,</p>

<p class="quoteb">&#8216;If the centre uses our product to put pressure on Lithuania, what stops us from doing the same to the centre!&#8217;</p>

<p class="fst">What a frightful thing that might be for Margaret Thatcher, her popularity already submerged to Gorbachev-like depths. It must have been bad enough to see Union Jacks with holes in the middle on the national demonstration against the poll tax.</p>
