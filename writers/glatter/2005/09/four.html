<p class="fst"><strong>4 (Chetyre)</strong><br />
<em>director Ilya Khrzhanovsky</em></p>

<p class="fst">This film won two awards at the Rotterdam Film Festival and has sparked controversy in Russia. &#8216;Out of decency and respect for their country, no English or American producer would release such a film&#8217;, said <strong>Rossiiskaya Gazeta</strong>, the official government newspaper. Khrzhanovsky, the film&#8217;s 25 year old director, has alleged that everyone who worked on the film has either been physically attacked or had their property vandalised.</p>

<p>Early in the film three people meet by chance in a bar. They talk about their work in a detached, knowledgeable, matter of fact way, as people do. Oleg confesses that he&#8217;s in the presidential administration. Marina asks about the president&#8217;s drinking habits, which turn out to be nowhere near as interesting as those of his wife. Marina, who is in advertising, is promoting a Japanese gadget which calms people down when they&#8217;re suffering from stress and makes them more productive. Volodya, a geneticist, is working on a programme which has been mass-producing clones for some time.</p>

<p>Although not really, because we find out that Volodya is actually a piano tuner. But then, unbeknown to him and to each other, Oleg is a meat merchant and Marina is a prostitute. This kind of scene is often more suited to the stage. But not here, where the unobtrusive intimacy of the camera, the deadpan wit of the dialogue (by Vladmir Sorokin, a radical writer) and the quiet conviction of the acting all go to construct a mountain of fascinating improbabilities.</p>

<p>I was fascinated and I was looking forward to going deeper into the unexpected. But the film didn&#8217;t develop quite as I was hoping. Its second hour is dominated by Marina&#8217;s visit to the village funeral of one of her sisters. The village is a zone of poverty, degradation and inescapable togetherness. It is inhabited almost exclusively by a group of old crones. Up to now they have scraped a living by producing ghoulish dolls. Faced with the prospect of economic annihilation, the villagers embark on a career of orgiastic consumption. One drunken wake follows another. These are the scenes that <strong>Rossiiskaya Gazeta</strong> took such exception to, accusing Khrzhanovsky of giving Russia a bad image abroad in order to gain plaudits, awards and funding for future projects. The fact that the Russian ministry of culture had part-funded the film provoked special fury. But Khrzhanovsky has said that &#8216;<em>4</em> is about how reality carves out a human&#8217;s individuality, turning a unique person into a piece of living meat.&#8217;</p>

<p>As a Russian reviewer has pointed out, this portrayal of degradation is only a problem for those who want to cover up the fact that &#8216;life for many in the depths of Russia is brutal and repulsive&#8217;. But there is a real problem with this part of the film. It is slow, repetitive, pretentious and self-indulgent. Khrzhanovsky has argued that the characters start with lies &#8216;but then life begins to confirm their lies and becomes incomprehensible, just as in reality&#8217;. This means that the film ends up by merely striking an attitude &#8211; epitomised for me by the repeated and, I suspect, meaningless references to the number four.</p>
